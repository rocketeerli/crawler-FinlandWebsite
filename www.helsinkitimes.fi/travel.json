{"title": "How to book the cheapest airline flight", "url": "http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/travel/13169-how-to-book-the-cheapest-airline-flight.html", "review": "", "content": "<p>How airlines price their tickets is a source of many myths and urban legends. These include tips about the best day of the week to buy a ticket, last-minute discounts offered by the airlines, and the conspiracy theories suggesting that the carriers use cookies to increase prices for their passengers. None of these is entirely true.<p><p>Studies have suggested that prices can be higher or lower on a given day of the week – yet, there is no clear consensus on which day that is. Offered prices can in fact drop at any time before the flight, yet they are much more likely to increase than decrease over the last several weeks before departure. Further, the airlines prefer to wait for the last-minute business traveler who’s likely to pay full fare rather than sell the seat prematurely to a price-conscious traveler. And no, the airlines do not use cookies to manipulate fare quotes – adjusting their inventory for specific customers appears to be beyond their technical capabilities.<p><p>What is true about pricing in the airline industry is that carriers use complex, sophisticated pricing systems. The airline’s per passenger cost is the lowest when the flight is full, so carriers have incentive to sell as many seats as possible. This is a race against time for an airline, and, of course, no company wants to discount its product more than it has to. Hence, the airlines face two somewhat contradictory goals: to maximise revenue by flying full planes and to sell as many full-fare seats as possible. This is known in the industry as yield or revenue management.<p><p>Airlines and their bucket lists<p><p>Here is how yield management works. For each flight or route (if we are talking about multi-segment itineraries), the airline has a set of available price levels – from the most expensive fully refundable fare to the cheapest, deeply discounted nonrefundable price. The industry jargon for these prices is “buckets.” Seats can be interpreted as balls that are allocated among these buckets.<p><p>Initial allocation of seats among the price buckets is determined by historical data indicating how well a certain flight sells. For example, fewer deeply discounted seats will be offered on a flight on Thanksgiving week than on the same flight during the third week of February. As the seats on a flight sell, yield managers monitor and adjust the seat allocation. If, for instance, the sales are slower than expected, some of the seats might be moved to lower-priced buckets — this shows up as a price drop. As noted above, such price drops can occur at any time before the flight. However, the general trend of price quotes is upward, starting from about two to three weeks before the flight departure date.<p><p>Of course, an average traveller wants to know when he or she should buy the tickets for the next trip. Another important question is where to buy this ticket. Airlines distribute their inventory on their own Web sites and on several computer distribution systems, meaning that prices can sometimes differ depending on where one looks for them. We are not entirely sure what precipitates this phenomenon – likely explanations include differences in contracts between the airlines and the distribution systems/travel agents, implying that different travel agents may not have access to the airline’s entire inventory of available prices.<p><p>When to book<p><p>The airlines’ yield managers start looking at flight bookings about two months before the departure date. This implies that it generally does not pay to book more than two months in advance: Studies show that initially the airlines leave the cheapest price buckets empty, and yield managers may move some seats into those buckets if a couple of months before the departure date the flight is emptier than expected. From two months to about two to three weeks before the flight date, the fare quotes remain mostly flat, with a slight upward trend. However, and perhaps paradoxically, there is a good chance of a price drop during this period. We tend to monitor prices for several days – sometimes up to a week – hoping for a lower quote. It does not always pay off, but sometimes we do manage to save a considerable amount of money.<p><p>Two to three weeks before the flight date, the price quotes start increasing. This is the time when business travellers start booking. While price drops are still possible, a chance of a price increase is much higher if you wait to book within this time period. This is also the time when one can find significant differences between price quotes, depending on where one looks and what contract they have with the airlines.<p><p>Thus, if we book a trip earlier than three weeks before the flight date, we tend not to delay the purchase. At the same time, we check quotes from multiple travel agents, or go directly to a site that allows for a quick comparison of prices (such as kayak.com or skyscanner.net). Or check the airline itself.<p><p>As for answering the original question we posed, here are some simple tips. First, if you have to travel during a peak period, such as Thanksgiving week, it is generally best not to delay buying that ticket. Otherwise, it might pay to monitor the offered prices for some time before committing. The best strategy for booking within the last couple of weeks before the flight, however, is not to delay the purchase, but to try getting quotes from several agents, which is easy to do in the Internet age.<p><p>Yuriy Gorodnichenko is an associate professor of economics at University of California, Berkeley.<p><p>Volodymyr Bilotkach is a senior lecturer in Economics at Newcastle University.<p><p>This article was originally published on The Conversation: www.theconversation.com.<p><p>Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Volodymyr Bilotkach The Washington Post<p><p>Lehtikuva / Mikko Stig<p>", "time": "2015-01-24T09:55:00+02:00", "type": "travel"}

The recent union of five municipalities has created a municipality with one of the highest amount of islands in the Åboland (Turunmaa in Finnish) area. It is located in the Finland Proper region in southwestern Finland, and is a bilingual municipality with a majority of Swedish speakers.<p><p>History<p><p>The current borders of the Pargas municipality have been relatively recently constructed, having been established in 2009. It was formed by uniting Houtskär, Iniö, Korpo and Nagu with the city of Pargas. The new municipality was given the name Väståboland, or Länsiturunmaa in Finnish. What followed was a lively debate regarding the name of the municipality, leading to a vote that would change its name. It adopted its current name of Pargas on 1 January 2012.<p><p>What is in a name? It became clear that to the islanders, a strong sense of identity was linked to it. In an article by YLE following the change of name, professor of public law at Åbo Akademi Markku Suksi said that the question of the name will still be a topic of discussion in upcoming years. He said the question will rise again because the divisions within the municipality may still change, and due to the strong grounds of identity in a name.<p><p>Business<p><p>For more than a thousand years people have been living in the archipelago, fishing, hunting and trading. The location of the Pargas archipelago has in the past made it effortless to trade with the Finnish inland, St. Petersburg and Tallinn.<p><p>During the middle ages, agriculture was the dominant form of industry in the Åboland region. Grains and livestock were core to agricultural production in Pargas. In the 1600s, the city was also home to a number of craftsmen such as tailors and carpenters.<p><p>Currently there is also a large industrial sector, and the shipping industry has been, and remains, a relevant industry for residents.<p><p>Culture<p><p>In the 800s, Vikings travelled through the archipelago during their eastbound journey. As such, there have been many ancient finds in archaeological excavations throughout the archipelago region of Åboland.<p><p>The people have traditionally lived from agriculture, fishing, hunting, shipping and crafts. The museums scattered around the Pargas archipelago help to tell the story of the region's history and traditions. Museums include the Houtskär Archipelago Museum, the local history museum of Korppoo, a maritime house in Nagu, and an industrial museum in Parainen city, to name just a few.<p><p>Pargas also has an interesting modern culture. Since 1992 Pargas city has organised the Rowlit festival, which has hosted many international bands including Smokie and Boney M. Rowlit is onomatopoeic of the archipelago dialect of the Swedish word 'roligt', which means 'fun'.<p><p>Nature<p><p>Pargas contains a large part of the southwestern archipelago with over 10,000 islands, islets and reefs. It stretches across an area which is over 5,500 square kilometres in size, 80 per cent of it being water.<p><p>It is an excellent location to spend the summer months on the sea. Pargas has ten marinas and twenty minor ports to houseguests. There are also 12 major bridges and multiple smaller bridges, making it easier to get around the islands. Otherwise travel by ferry between islands is also possible. There are busy guest harbours, but also scattered around the archipelago at smaller guest harbours are idyllic cafes and restaurants that capture the essence of the archipelago life, often serving traditional dishes from the region.<p><p>Another way to explore the scenery is by bike. There are many nature trails that allow travel around the different islands and through the forests.<p><p>Alicia Jensen<p><p>Helsinki Times Images: Rosalinda Whybrow<p>", "time": "2015-01-22T16:07:00+02:00", "type": "travel"}

Historically it is one of the oldest parishes in the Ostrobothnia region.<p><p>History<p><p>There is no record of exactly how old Pederöre is, but it is one of three original parishes in the Gulf of Bothnia. It was first mentioned in writing in 1348, when King Magnus Eriksson issued a statute concerning trade in the parishes of Korsholm, Närpes, and Pedersöre.<p><p>In 1865 Esse and Purmo separated from Pedersöre to become their own parishes. Pedersöre's current borders were drawn in 1977 when Esse and Purmo came back together with Pedersöre to create a larger municipal area.<p><p>Business<p><p>The rivers in Pedersöre have been important in shaping the business history of the municipality, allowing carpenters in the region to become famous for their shipbuilding between the 1500s and the 1800s.

There are a multitude of museums that demonstrate how farmers have lived in the last few centuries, and how they made their livelihood.<p><p>The Fagerbacka farm, for example, is the only one of its kind left in Ostrobothnia. It displays both calm scenery and a traditional environment with graying log cabins surrounded by a fence.

Pedersöre's longest trail is approximately 50 kilometers in length, and is called the Utterleden, or Otter Trail. It winds through the most sparsely populated part of the municipality, exhibiting 'untouched' nature and forests. It also follows the Esse river and Purmo north river. Following the trail will lead you to one of Finland's largest erratic boulders, called 'Lostenen'. There are steps and railings built to reach the top of the stone, so that visitors can enjoy the view.<p><p>Another trail is called Skalderna's stig, or Poet's path. It is located in Kiisk, Lappfors. Although the village is small, its cultural heritage is still well maintained. The trail is about 5 kilometers in length, and along it one can find paintings, poems and information about the flora and fauna which can be observed along the trail.<p><p>Authors Hjalmar Korkfors and Viola Revall lived by Kiisk for a number of years, where Krokfors was a school teacher. The pair called the path down to the Esse river the Kärleksstigen, or Path of Love. Kiisk still holds a permanent exhibition displaying works by the two authors, and other pieces from their life including photographs and objects that belonged to them.<p><p>Yet for something different, one can go fishing in the Esse river, its rapids being a great location for catching fishing grayling, brown trout and pike. Lakes Mosavatten and Stikpiksjön are also good locations for fishing.

It is a bilingual municipality with a majority of Swedish speakers, situated by the sea.<p><p>History<p><p>Jakobstad was founded in 1652. On 19 June Queen Christina granted Count Jacob de la Gardie the right to found the town in the parish of Pedersöre, yet after his death the project was taken over by his widow Countess Ebba Brahe. The town was named Jakobstad after the Count, but its Finnish name Pietarsaari pays tribute to the municipality it once belonged to, Pedersöre.<p><p>According to a brief history compiled by Guy Björklund for the Jakobstad Museum, the area that now makes up Jakobstad was under the sea two thousand years ago, eventually breaking the surface and becoming inhabitable.<p><p>Jakobstad's history is spotted with war, beginning at the Russian invasion of Finland which took place between 1713-1721, known as The Great Unrest.<p><p>Jakobstad was invaded and burned to the ground twice, with only a few buildings left sanding. At that time, most of its inhabitants became refugees with the wealthier crossing over to Sweden and others fleeing to forests or the Kvarken archipelago. After Finland declared independence from Russia in 1917, Jakobstad saw an occupation on 28 January 1918 led by Jaeger Colonel Lauri Tiainen.<p><p>This eventually led to the disarmament of Russian troops, but not without struggle. After the outbreak of the civil war, or Winter War, in 1939, Jakobstad began to play a role in civil defence. On 22 February 1944, during The Continuation War, Jakobstad was bombed by the Soviets.<p><p>Not only has the town seen war, but Jakobstad has also seen a lot of wealth. In 1898 Otto Malm died as the wealthiest man in Finland. He was head of business at the House of Malm, his father having been the head of the board of commerce and one of the most successful merchants and ship owners of the time.

In the 18th century Jakobstad became the biggest producer of new ships in Finland. Being granted navigational rights – rights to sail directly to foreign ports – in 1765 was an important step in the development of many towns on the coast of Bothnia, including Jakobstad. The new rights opened new trading routes for the Finnish shipping industry. In 1782, frigate Concordia was the first Finnish ship to sail in the East Indies. The barque Hercules, built in Jakobstad, became the first Finnish ship to sail around the globe between 1844 and 1847.<p><p>Other traditional industries included the export of tar, pitch and products from sawmills, which contributed to making Jakobstad a wealthy town. Towards the end of the 19th century, the town became industrialised- beginning with a chicory factory in 1883. In the 20th century the pulp and plastic industry became important to Jakobstad. Currently Jakobstad has a thriving industry of wood, pulp, ship building and food products.<p><p>Culture<p><p>The Jakob's Days festival attracts tourists and locals to Jakobstad in the summer to enjoy theatre, concerts and other events. The first Jakob's Days were celebrated in 1976 to promote tourism, and consisted of song, music and sport.<p><p>Museums to visit include the town museum of Jakobstad, the Arctic Museum and the Chicory museum.<p><p>The Chicory museum is the only one of its kind in Finland, and is situated in an old chicory factory dating back to 1893 and allows visitors to view how chicory, a caffeine-free additive, was produced and taste chicory coffee. It is also possible to visit Runeberg's cottage, built by Johan Ludvig Runeberg's mother's brother Mathias Mattson Malm and his father Lorenz Ulrik Runeberg in 1811.<p><p>Nature<p><p>Situated by the coast, Jakobstad has a beautiful archipelago to visit with beaches and harbours along its coast.

Vörå, or Vöyri in Finnish, is a bilingual municipality with a majority of Swedish speakers. It is incidentally also where Jean Sibelius got married.<p><p>History<p><p>Until 1809, Finland was under Swedish rule. One of the main battles to change the fate of Finland was the battle of Oravais, which took place in Vörå during the Finnish War of 1808-9. During the course of the battle, Russian troops attacked the Swedish troops located in Oravais, causing the latter to retreat. The Battle is considered one of the bloodiest of the war – it is estimated that there were at least 1,000 Finnish and Swedish and 800 Russian casualties. The battle was also a critical one for Finland’s future – losing it meant becoming part of Russia.<p><p>Tourism entrepreneur Jussi Mendelin explains that the island of Västerö, on the coast of Vårö, has been a strategically important location.<p><p>As the first world war began, so began plans to actualise the dream of an independent Finland. About 2000 Finns travelled to Germany to join the Jägers military movement to get military training. To avoid the Russians they used secret roads, one of which passed through the island of Västerö. As such, it was an important area for the beginnings of the Finnish Jäger Movement.<p><p>Finnish fighters were then secretly trained by returning Jägers in Finland.

The post boats were a fleet comprised of individuals from Björkö with the responsibility of carrying mail throughout the Kvarken area. In return, they were granted exemption from military service and reduced taxes by Swedish King Gustav II Adolf. The post boats roamed the seas until 1809, and the residents of Björkö had to resume their services to the military and paying taxes. At the commemoration event, boats characteristic of those used in the 17th century sail through the archipelago.<p><p>Korsholm is home to the second oldest stone bridge still in use in Finland, situated in Toby. It exhibits bridge architecture from the 18th century. Its twin arches were risky business at the time – the job was given to convicts sentenced to life in prison. The convicts were promised freedom if they succeeded in removing the centre without the bridge collapsing. The bridge has been standing since 1781 – it was clearly built by some motivated hands!<p><p>Finland's longest bridge at 1,045 metres, the Replot bridge, can also be found on Korsholm. It connects the archipelago with the main land, where until 1997 only ferries were used.<p><p>There are many beautiful churches to visit in Korsholm, the main church being situated in Gamla Vasa, or Old Vasa. It was built in 1786 as a courthouse, and rebuilt as a church in 1863. There are two museums in Replot and Björköby, and a boat and fishing museum in Södra Vallgrund for more historical experiences.<p><p>...<p><p>Alicia Jensen HELSINKI TIMES Image: Ann-Britt Pada<p><p>Only a fraction of the articles are available to public, please subscribe to be able to read whole article on the digital paper.<p><p>Please check our subscription periods and prices from here.<p><p>Read Helsinki Times with a subscriber code Helsinki Times's digital paper has moved to our partner's website, LEHTILUUKKU.FI<p><p>Helsinki Times can be read with a subscriber code provided by the publisher or subscription office.<p><p>If you have received a subscriber code from the Helsinki Times, you may attach it to your Lehtiluukku user account to gain free access to Helsinki Times.

Its unique nature has allowed it to become a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) World Heritage site.<p><p>History<p><p>The Malax municipality was established in 1973, bringing together Bergö, Malax and Petalax. The municipality was finalised in 1975 with the inclusion of Norra Pörtom from the Närpes municipality.<p><p>Located in the archipelago and in close proximity to Vaasa, Malax has an interesting nautical history. The history of Malax has been affected by war since the 1700s, their harbours creating interest among merchant ships heading towards Vaasa.<p><p>Business<p><p>New business opportunities have arisen with the recent inclusion of Malax in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites. Business has been created in the tourism and restaurant industries, and in an effort to teach about the culture and unique nature of Malax, and general world heritage pedagogy.<p><p>Culture<p><p>A nature path will take you right back to the Iron Age – just follow the 'Iron Age Trail' to discover preserved artefacts such as cairns and cup stones that date back to the years 200-700 AD. You'll also come across a cottage displaying information about the archaeology, and a cow house which exhibits agricultural implements.<p><p>Malax also boasts one of the largest boat museums in the Nordic countries, the Kvarken Boat Museum. It displays a collection of 76 wooden boats, dating from the years 1850-1993. Another museum to visit is the Brinken Museum, which displays a farmhouse from 1879. In the summer, it is also possible to see a garden that has recently been restored to the way it looked in the year 1930.<p><p>A charming local legend names the Malaxians the 'big eaters'. The story goes as follows: A man from Malax was going to spend a week in Ribäck to work in the forestry industry. He ate a big breakfast before his trip, and then set off on the adventure with a bucket of sour milk and bread to last him the week.<p><p>Residents with Swedish as mother tongue: approx. 86.01% Residents with Finnish as mother tongue: approx. 9.84%<p><p>520.98 km2 of land 4.25 km2 of fresh water 1429.7 km2 of salt water<p><p>Women: 2732 Men: 2843<p><p>For more fun, visit: www.malax.fi<p><p>Halfway to Ribäck, however, he sat down to rest. He decided to taste a piece of sour bread, which was 38 cm wide and 15 cm thick. Soon, there was nothing left of the bread. \"Now I need to be careful,\" he thought to himself. He spent the whole week in Ribäck without food. When he came home, he told his wife what had happened. She couldn't keep her mouth shut about the incident – which is when people began to call the Malaxians the big eaters.<p><p>Nature<p><p>In 2006, the Malax and Korsnäs municipalities were added to the World Heritage List of UNESCO. As such, they joined the neighbouring High Coast area which had been included as a world heritage site in the year 2000. There are two types of world heritage sites, the cultural and the natural; it is possible for a site to be both. The High Coast - Quark area is of the latter type. The uniqueness of the High Coast-Quark area is based on its natural geological formations, such as the skull caps and the De Geer moraines.<p><p>Becoming a world heritage site means that the area needs to be protected, preserved and be made available for tourism, to allow visitors to see the unique nature that the area offers. That said, there is plenty of nature to see when visiting Malax. In an effort to make it easier to experience the natural rocky archipelago in Malax, the Rönnskär pilot station has been made into a nature station.<p><p>Alicia Jensen HELSINKI TIMES<p>", "time": "2014-11-21T11:08:51+02:00", "type": "travel"}

The aim of the unification was to create a strong community with a high level of service and discretion. Since 1983, the municipality has been a bilingual one.<p><p>Business<p><p>Craftsmanship has strong roots in Kronoby. The town of Kronoby boasts both a ceramics shop and a glass shop. The origins of the businesses can be observed at the various historical buildings and museums in Kronoby.<p><p>Culture<p><p>Their website describes the inhabitants of Kronoby as a people with 'genuine humour and language'. Over the years the municipality has brought many poets and beautiful poems. It is often said that their people know how to tell stories like nobody else. Not only is poetry rife but the culture is riddled with song and theatre, amounting to a lively community. You might, however, have trouble understanding their accents, which have a ring to them that may sound foreign to those accustomed to southern Finnish and Swedish accents. Nonetheless, their friendliness and sincerity should not be difficult to misunderstand, reminds their municipality pages.<p><p>Kronoby also has plenty of historic buildings and museums to visit. There is a 200 year old rectory, which has developed in to a museum over time. It is set in an idyllic landscape, and provides a glimpse in to the long history of Kronoby. The museum area includes a school museum, a husbandry museum, a soldier museum and a dugout. There are also rooms dedicated to remembering H.G. Porthan, J.L. Runeberg, and Annie Krokfors.<p><p>On the island of Cronoholm, one can visit the remains of an old wooden ship carving shop, which existed from the years 1674-1703. Tolvmansgården is also very close by. It is the local history society's museum, and has gathered buildings from the 1800s and 1900s and displays both home and agricultural appliances and crafts. In early August the location also hosts an old-time themed market, organised yearly.<p><p>One also has the possibility to visit a church built in 1822 with a belfry dating to the year 1660. Its architecture is based on the drawings of senior curator C.F. Fredenheim. The building itself is constructed by H. Kuorikoski.<p><p>Korpeholm is a region in Kronoby which also has a fascinating history. In 1628, Governor Johan Månsson Ulfsparre was given an assignment to construct a hospital for those suffering from leprosy on Korpeholm. It was a controversial move at the time, and was not happily received by all, particularly by Malax in the North, as a leper hospital already existed in the South on an island called Själö.<p><p>At the start, the hospital in Korpeholm was mainly for lepers, but at the beginning of the 1700s patients with mental illnesses, suffering from blindness, and other poor people stricken by illness were also accepted at the hospital. What is left of the hospital is a memorial by the old cemetery of those buried between the years 1631-1828.<p><p>Nature<p><p>Kronoby is situated in a river valley. The two streams, Kronoby stream and Perho stream, cross through the municipality. Yet the sea is not far away, allowing for a diverse range of natural landscape and experience. Although the town is lively, it is easy to find a silent spot not far away from the hustle and bustle of town life.<p><p>Alicia Jensen HELSINKI TIMES Image: Studio Sara<p>", "time": "2014-11-16T12:19:23+02:00", "type": "travel"}

It is a bilingual municipality where the majority of the population speak Swedish.<p><p>History<p><p>Count Peter Brahe founded Kristinestad on the Koppö island in the year 1649, having noticed its potential for a port. The Swedish Queen Christina signed the charter of the town, becoming the namesake of Kristinestad. The 'Lilliputian' new port grew slowly until it established itself as a trading hub in the 18th century.<p><p>Business<p><p>In 1792 the city was given staple rights, the right to require a passing ship either to pay customs or sell part of its cargo at the market place. As a result trade grew rapidly, and the market place of Kristinestad has been lively ever since. The town flourished with industries in ship building, seafaring, leather factories, breweries, fishing and various workshops, appealing to the bourgeoisie and artisans. Previous exports included tar and timber.<p><p>Currently, Kristinestad specialises in potatoes – making approximately 20 per cent of Finland's potatoes. Fishing is also prevalent, with two fishing harbours: Sideby and Skaftung. Services, industry, agriculture and forestry are at the core of the city's business. Small local industries are central to everyday life. Forest machinery is also exported.<p><p>Culture<p><p>Kristinestad is known for its low wooden houses and narrow alleys. The houses, 300 of which are protected by city plan regulations, are painted in an array of colours and have beautifully preserved history. Many of the houses in the old town date to the 18th and 19th centuries. The street plan of the Renaissance period also still exists, although the last hundred years of architectural development is also evident in the different styles of wooden houses.<p><p>Perhaps the most spectacular are the Empire style merchant's trade buildings. The houses by the seaside were home to ship owners and other bourgeoisie. The houses diminish in size the farther their distance from the coast, following the social classes of the time. Wells around the city have also been protected. There are also two customs houses built in 1680 and 1720, as historically, there was a cost to enter the town.<p><p>Kristinestad also has a 300 year old Ulrika Eleonora church, and the famous \"Cat Whipper's Alley\", or Kattpiskargränden. The Wolf Cave is a short drive away, where signs of human habitation 120,000 years ago have been discovered. The city still has a busy market square at its heart. Leading to the square is a 300 m stone bridge, opened to use in 1845.<p><p>Kristinestad is Finland's first Cittaslow community. The philosophy of Cittaslow focuses on improving the quality of life by slowing down the pace in the community, and building sustainable development.

It is located in the Ostrobothnia region. It is the last monolingual municipality that will be considered on mainland Finland, as the rest of the Swedish monolingual municipalities belong to the Åland islands.<p><p>History<p><p>Larsmo was founded in 1867. It borders Lake Larsmo to the East, the Gulf of Bothnia to the West, the City of Karleby in the North and the City of Jakobstad in the South. The road connecting the island based municipality to the rest of the world is called the road of Seven Bridges. The largest islands are Larsmo and Eugmo. The main residential areas are Risö, Holm, Eugmo, and Bosund.<p><p>For a brief moment in history, Larsmo claimed international fame with the mysterious Grafton Affair. In 1905, as Finnish separatist movements were gathering momentum, the ship S/S John Grafton was organised to bring weapons to aid nationalists in an armed uprising against Tsarist Russia, which Finland belonged to at the time. It was bought by a Japanese army officer, enemy to Russia.<p><p>On 6 September the Grafton, with its name concealed, arrived at the Larsmo archipelago following a brief landing at Kemi, and many of its weapons were unloaded in the Larsmo archipelago. They were transported to the main land in small boats.<p><p>The next morning as the Grafton was disembarking, however, it ran aground. It was decided that the ship had to be blown up before the Russians would find out about it, so it was transported close to Sweden and exploded at 4 pm on 8 September.<p><p>Soon after the incident, newspapers across the country reported on the mysterious exploding ship. The story was even picked up by international media, including the Times, Deutsche Tageblatt, and the Daily Mail.<p><p>Although the effort failed to some extent as a lot of weapons were lost, the Grafton Affair is often referred to as the first step towards the fight for Finnish independence.<p><p>Business<p><p>The service industry makes up 55.9 per cent of the labour force in Larsmo, along with small local industries. The importance of traditional industries of fishing, hunting and agriculture have diminished over time. An important industry in Larsmo is the boat building industry.<p><p>Culture<p><p>There are two museums in Larsmo, the Bjärgas local museum, and the Bosund boat and fishing museum. The Bjärgas museum includes a village shop from the 1950s, and displays local war history. The surrounding area also features a windmill and a carpenter's workshop. The boat and fishing museum displays boats, engines, hunting and fishing gear. Larsmo also has a church built in 1787 by Jacob Rijf, located in a picturesque area.<p><p>Larsmo is twinned with two cities, Klaebu in Norway and Malå in Sweden. The concept of twinning cities is an aim to promote culture and trade among cities across international borders.<p><p>Nature<p><p>Two thousand years ago, the first cliffs that currently make up the islands of Larmso appeared above the ocean. Located in the archipelago, Larsmo tempts tourists with forest trail and beautiful coastal scenery. There are possibilities for hiking, fishing, canoeing and biking.<p><p>Köpmanholmen is a recreational area situated on an island at rowing distance from the mainland of Larsmo.

The phenomenon is making a return. <p><p>Would you let strangers into your home for a fee? And could you stay in a stranger's home?<p><p>More and more Finns do and could. The Internet enables the temporary renting out of homes more easily and safely than before. People can read the reviews of others on lodgings, and holiday home agents ensure that the money does not go to fraudsters.<p><p>A popular dealer of holiday homes is the American website Airbnb, which aims to expand its activities in Finland.<p><p>\"There is a lot of demand for flats in Helsinki,\" says Aja Guldhammer, the company's Nordic Country Manager, via telephone from Copenhagen.<p><p>According to Guldhammer, Airbnb monitors the attractiveness of sites based on, for example, the kinds of searches that are done on their pages. A lot of searches are done for lodgings in Helsinki – but there are still not many on offer.<p><p>\"At the end of 2013, there were about 600 flats or rooms offered in Helsinki. At the same time, Copenhagen had 6,000 rooms on offer. So there is a lot of potential.\"<p><p>The offerings are also growing. This year, the number of Helsinki flats on the website has risen to nearly 700.<p><p>Kallio offering<p><p>One of the new sites is located on Kaarlenkatu in Kallio. A thrift store &amp; coffee shop combination, which probably interests urban tourists, is downstairs.<p><p>Software entrepreneur Rémi Lanvin rings the buzzer and steps into the hallway. The Frenchman has photographed Helsinki flats part-time for the Airbnb website already for a few years. Recently, there has been much more work. Also this Saturday, he is scheduled for two shoots.<p><p>Airbnb pays the photographer's fee. Lanvin receives specific instructions from California on the types of photographs he must take. One of the new demands is an outside photograph of the building. The Finnish climate often makes taking it difficult.<p><p>\"I complained about it to California, where they told me to set up shoots only for sunny days,\" Lanvin says and laughs.<p><p>The photographs are sent to California to be checked by the company before they can be published online. The host of the flat may decide which of the photographs are published. Lanvin advises them to discard the slushy outdoor photographs.<p><p>Learn by reviewing<p><p>Architecture student Krista Meskanen's home on Kaarlenkatu looks and smells clean. \"Of course I would clean it also before guests arrive,\" she says.<p><p>One of Airbnb's essential features is that both the hosts and guests may leave reviews of each other on the website for others to read.<p><p>At the Meskanen home, Lanvin digs out the camera and goes to work.<p><p>\"Could you turn on all the lights possible?\"<p><p>The flat has a kitchen and a living room with an alcove. There are only two doors: to the bathroom and the hallway. This is why Meskanen and her boyfriend rent out the flat only when they are away. They assume the guests want some privacy.<p><p>On the Airbnb website, one can choose whether one wants to rent out the whole flat, a private room or a shared room.<p><p>Meskanen's two sisters have also advertised their homes on the website. The other one just rented out her home during a Lapland trip – and received the money for lift tickets and train trips.<p><p>Meskanen thinks it is natural to let strangers into your home. She also likes to have guests in her home. Her work colleagues, for their part, have been surprised.<p><p>\"Many have said that they would never let a stranger into their home.\"<p><p>Nothing new<p><p>Accommodating travellers in homes is a phenomenon older than hotels. These kinds of inns existed already in ancient Rome. Big hotels became common only in the 1800s,\" says Pirjo Sanaksenaho, professor of building design at Aalto University.<p><p>In many countries, the phenomenon never disappeared. In the German-speaking Europe, \"Zimmer frei\" signs advertise available rooms. England, for its part, promises the traveller a bed and breakfast.<p><p>Sanaksenaho estimates that the Finnish home began to change into a more private space at the same time as servants disappeared from homes, i.e. from around the 1950s. It also changed the architecture, as the servants' rooms disappeared.<p><p>Now Finns may spend the night in a hotel, even if they have relatives or even acquaintances in the city.<p><p>\"The old bourgeois flats had separate entertainment areas and public zones. The functionalistic flat, for its part, has spaces only for family members.\"<p><p>Airbnb's whole website is a massive visual archive, which tells how people around the world live. It has homes from New York to Nepal.<p><p>Sanaksenaho thinks homes are opening up again because of the cultural change brought about by social media.<p><p>\"We are not so afraid any- more to show photographs of ourselves, our family and home. The same thing shows in the architecture. There are glass balconies and large glass walls, through which we are, in a way, visible all the time.\"<p><p>According to Sanaksenaho, the openness shows especially in the housing architecture of Denmark and the Netherlands.<p><p>Krista Meskanen, who has lived in Denmark, is not surprised either that Copenhagen has ten times as many Airbnb flats as Helsinki. \"Sharing flats is more common there anyway. Many of my friends were subtenants.\"<p><p>Amsterdam, for its part, is one of the first cities to have an agreement on the rules of operation with Airbnb.<p><p>Rules are needed especially in cities suffering from a lack of housing. At worst, Airbnb and its competitors take away permanent housing from people. On the website, also real estate investors may deal flats, which may reduce the number of flats offered on the city's rental market. In popular destinations, more money can be charged from tourists than from permanent tenants.<p><p>Nordic County Manager Guldhammer says that the company has done studies in different cities on how many people are renting out their own homes. According to the results, the clear majority of the flats are homes.<p><p>Battling authorities<p><p>Airbnb is fighting its most important battle against authorities in New York. The renting out of an entire apartment is often illegal there.<p><p>In Helsinki, one would think the authorities would welcome Airbnb. A month ago, Tuulikki Becker, managing director of Helsinki Travel Marketing, said in Helsingin Sanomat that Helsinki is losing out to Stockholm and Copenhagen in the number of travellers due to the city's lack of accommodation capacity.<p><p>In Finland, in addition to Helsinki, there are Airbnb sites around the country: from Savonlinna to Kangasala and Sipoo to Rovaniemi.<p><p>Tuulevi Aschan, 48, has taken travellers into her home in Mikkeli's Ristiina municipality for a year. First she tried out the accommodation herself in Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Initially, she heard about the website from her friend, who had used it in New York.<p><p>\"I was inspired to put up my own advertisement. We have space when it's just my husband and I in the house. The children's rooms are mainly empty now that they have moved into their own places,\" Aschan says.<p><p>In the summer, also the lakeside sauna's electricity-free space is in use. It is exotic. During the year, it has had about 15 visitors, while receiving twice the amount of enquiries.<p><p>\"I just printed out the receipts of the payments I've received for the tax authorities. It's easy to access them.\"<p><p>The most memorable visitor has been the Australian Margaret, who postponed her return flights in order to spend more time in Ristiina. She wanted to row around the peninsula, pick blueberries for her morning yogurt and meditate on the dock.<p><p>\"At the time, I was working from home, and at times we sat on the porch with cups of tea, talking and making the world a better place.\"<p><p>That is the best thing about home lodging.

The shantys are child-friendly, and come equipped with heated floors, free Wi-Fi, and spa services.<p><p>2. Vacation like a border crosser, in Mexico<p><p>Parque EcoAlberto Hidalgo, Mexico Lodging from €76 per night “Night Walk” Tour €14 per person Tastelessness: Moderate<p><p>In Southern Mexico, an eco-park owned by Hñahñu Indians offers tourists a chance to live out the drama and tension of an illegal border crossing. Called “Night Walk,” the strange excursion lasts about four hours and takes groups on an imaginary journey through the desert and across the Rio Grande. A dozen or so Hñahñus act out different roles: fellow migrants in search of work, as well as police on the lookout for border crossers. The park has many other attractions, too – including hot springs, kayaking and camp grounds – but the Night Walk seems to be the biggest draw.<p><p>3. In Indonesia, an authentic, bare-bones (and sometimes flooded) getaway<p><p>Banana Republic Village Jakarta, Indonesia Lodging €7 per night Tastelessness: High<p><p>Travelers looking for a more realistic third-world experience may find it at “Banana Republic,” a plantation village just minutes outside of Jakarta. Seven euros per night will get you a room, a mattress, and a fan within this interconnected complex of shanty homes. Bring your own flashlight if you expect to use the outdoor toilet at night, as well as your own toiletries for the communal shower. If that’s not authentic enough for you, the Airbnb posting notes that “In December, the floods arrive. Heavy rain causes the river surrounding the village to overflow... The rusty roofs leak and leave the homes damp.” According to the ad, your seven euros will go towards unclogging the river and repairing damaged roofs – but not before you get the chance to enjoy both.<p><p>4. Tour Rio de Janeiro’s largest favela with some of its very own residents<p><p>Favela Tourism Workshop Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Tour starting from €22 per person Tastelessness: Moderate to Mild<p><p>A Brazilian company called Exotic Tours was the first to offer sightseeing tours of Rio de Janeiro’s biggest slum, Rocinha. In recent years, it began hiring local favela residents to work as guides, an effort that created a more authentic experience for travelers, and provided some income for members of the community. The company claims that some of the proceeds benefit a local school, so tourists can rest assured that they’re doing their part to help Rio’s urban poor. Be warned, though: Increasing tourism has helped to transform Rocinha from a sprawling shantytown into a semi-developed urban slum, so it’s perhaps less gritty than the average poverty tourist might prefer.<p><p>5. In Sweden, book a spot below an overpass like a homeless person<p><p>Faktum Hotels Gothenburg, Sweden Lodging starting from €11per night Tastelessness: Moderate<p><p>Gothenburg, Sweden, has more than 3,000 homeless people. Now, one company, Faktum Hotels, has mapped out 10 of their favorite places to sleep, and is renting them out to intrepid travelers who want to experience Sweden from the perspective of its most destitute. Book a corner at the abandoned paper mill, curl up under a bridge, or camp out in a public park (conveniently situated near several trendy cafes). Admittedly, the enterprise is a tad tongue-in-cheek. Hotel proceeds go towards programmes that benefit Gothenburg’s homeless population. Patrons aren’t even expected to sleep in the spots they book – but it’s probably fair to assume that at least a few bold souls have given it a try.<p><p>6. Walk a mile in a homeless person’s shoes, in Amsterdam<p><p>Mokum Events Amsterdam, Netherlands Tour starts at €11.50 per person Tastelessness: Moderate (though Mokum’s advertising language gets a High)<p><p>If you want a more textured experience of homelessness than a single night under a bridge can accomplish, you might trek on over to Amsterdam, where an entertainment company is offering city tours guided by an actual homeless person. As advertised on its website, Mokum Events “has found a homeless person in Amsterdam who experienced it all”. For a fee, you can take a walk with this man, beg for food together, and hear all about the ups and downs of living on the street. And lest you question the ethics of this pastime, the company reassures tourists that “your homeless person is not unhappy!” He’ll even show you where he sleeps and “point to the rubbish bins of restaurants, where at times a royal meal can be made from hearty scraps.”<p><p>7. Enjoy San Francisco’sgrittiest neighborhood alongside its homeless<p><p>Vayable San Francisco, California Tour is €14.50 per person Tastelessness: Relatively mild<p><p>Most visitors to San Francisco try to avoid the Tenderloin, a downtown neighborhood once notorious for its high crime rate but now better known for its population of vagrants. One man, Milton Aparicio, is trying to change that, by offering tours that highlight the Tenderloin’s unique culture of homeless. “We’ll go to a couple of shelters, day centers for children, soup kitchens, “ he advertises, offering “a guided experience of what it’s like to be homeless from a friendly homeless person.” Like most other examples of slum tourism, it promises an eye-opening experience that will certainly lead to personal growth and enlightenment.<p><p>In that respect, contemporary poverty tourism still resembles its 19th century predecessors. While the original London slumming parties were unabashedly voyeuristic and exploitative, they nevertheless revealed an upside: The parting of the veil between rich and poor moved some members of the upper classes to charitable action. “London slumming brought to the notice of the rich much suffering,” The New York Times reported in 1884, “and led to sanitary reforms.”<p><p>Modern day slumming, by contrast, is often characterised at the outset as a socially responsible endeavor – often purporting to benefit impoverished communities. That said, it’s still a little creepy to pay for the experience of watching poor people like animals in a zoo.<p><p>Catherine A.

Like trainspotting and stamp collecting, it brings to mind images of nerdy men in camouflage gear with multiple pairs of binoculars. It just isn’t me. I’m relieved when my guide Amin turns up barefoot, in shorts and a T-shirt and looking quite normal.<p><p>The Gambia is a tiny country; a mere 50 kilometres wide and around 400 kilometres long, a thin finger of land carved out of the Senegal. Although it may seem easy to overlook, the Gambia is to bird watching what Italy is to Formula One or Wembley is to football. People travel from all around the world to see the thousand species of birds that breed here, and I’ve decided to join them.<p><p>The Gambia has plenty of national parks, scattered from the stunning Atlantic beach coast to the dense mangrove swamps in the far east of the country. Bird watchers can skip from one to another in a hopscotch game of subtly changing ecosystems.<p><p>For Europe’s migratory birds the river basin forms a kind of smorgasbord, rich in delights such as grasshoppers, mice, berries and fruit alongside the usual staple of small fish.<p><p>After trying one or two coastal parks, I head inland to Bintang Bolong. It offers accommodation in home-made stilt houses perched a few inches above what at low tide is mud and at high tide is a river. My bed sits on a slight angle that suggests that if I roll over at night, I might not stop.<p><p>Amin suggests that we head out on foot first, guiding me out through rice paddies and small stands of mango into large, flat fields punctuated by massive baobab and king trees. As the sun begins to set the trees fill with life and sound.<p><p>I quickly realise that I might not be very good at this. “See there! At the top of that tree!” Amin shrieks, pointing at some flash of red feathers. “It’s gone” he sighs disappointedly, while I am still trying to figure out which tree he meant.<p><p>Much of what he shouts is lost on me. Herons I have heard of, but shrikes? Whimbrels? Rollers? As in Bay City? I have no idea what I am looking for.<p><p>I take a number of photographs of empty branches and blurred trees. After an hour my best picture is of a donkey, and that was tied up.<p><p>As the light fades it gets a little easier. Either that or the birds are getting bigger. We spot a white heron, some egrets, harrier hawks and a stunning fish eagle on the prowl.<p><p>A second attempt<p><p>Better still comes at dawn, as I roll out of bed amidst a chorus of fruit bats and into Amin’s waiting canoe.<p><p>In the first rays of the sun we spot black hawk-like kites overhead, the odd pelican and the much rarer African darter.

{"title": "The art of cheap tickets", "url": "http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/travel/7891-the-art-of-cheap-tickets.html", "review": "", "content": "<p>Although these days travelling by plane can certainly feel less enjoyable than it used to be, with crowded airports, over-zealous security and the noble airline meal often reduced to a damp, flimsy sandwich, one can still take heart from the fact that if it’s not as comfortable as it could be, air travel can certainly be cheap.<p><p>If you’re planning a trip and want to make the most of your money, the number one rule is shop around. There is a general proliferation of websites devoted to finding cheap tickets which all work on the same principle – they search dozens of websites so that you don’t have to, and then collate the information by price, trip duration and so on. Even amongst these websites, however, you can find surprisingly large variations on even identical flights, and more so if you consult airline websites as well.<p><p>Using a number of cheap flights websites as well as those belonging to the airlines themselves, in the name of research I looked for flights from Helsinki to Delhi for a two week trip back in mid-August. Strictly in monetary terms, the cheapest flights I found were on expedia.co.uk, where one can travel with Aeroflot for a mere 506 euros. The exact same flight was available on the Aeroflot site and kayak.com for 596 euros, so there’s a 90 euro saving straight away. Kayak.com and sistaminuten.se both had flights with Lufthansa and KLM respectively for 656 euros, with the airlines websites offering the same price.<p><p>Some cheap flight websites<p><p>expedia.co.uk sistaminuten.se kayak.com supersaver.fi momondo.fi tripadvisor.com skyscanner.net<p><p>Finnair’s prices were slightly more expensive at 686 euros from the airline itself or 697 euros on Expedia, but this is where other factors come into play. We all know that the cheapest tickets come with strict caveats such as not being able to change travel dates and so on, but if you choose to save 180 euros on this flight by choosing Aeroflot over Finnair and you set yourself up for a 29-hour journey there and 16-hour trip on the way back due to the curse of the stopover, whereas the Finnair flights are direct.<p><p>Personally, I’d rather pay the extra and have what basically amounts to an extra day at my final destination. On the other hand, if you want to spend 5-10 hours at Amsterdam/Frankfurt/Moscow airport then it will save you a few pennies, and the other advantage of course is that, if you can organise it, it’s normally possible to spend a day or two in the city where your stopover occurs, if desired.<p><p>Finally, don’t forget to search budget airlines’ websites. For example, Norwegian, Air Berlin and Blue One are all examples of cheap airlines whose flights are often not included in the websites noted above. If you’re prepared to do the searching you may well find more budget-orientated options directly.<p><p>Nick Barlow HELSINKI TIMES LEHTIKUVA / HEIKKI SAUKKOMAA / JARNO MELA <p>", "time": "2013-10-03T10:20:51+03:00", "type": "travel"}

Of the 25 or so ticket windows in a reservations hall at some train stations, only one is dedicated to tourists. Oh, let’s not forget the elderly, disabled, freedom fighters, group bookings and even ticket cancellations also battling for the same elbow space as foreigners, designated to the same queue.

Once the line of carriages is motionless, the big push on board of new passengers often results in a bottleneck of arms and legs struggling against each other.<p><p>The trains themselves are a packed jamboree of noise, and life in close quarters. Typically, intercity trains are divide into three classes, each offering their own window into Indian culture. First class sees the upper echelons of society relaxing in air conditioned comfort. In sleeper cars replete with their 72 beds, passengers are scattered about every available space. Sellers fill the air with an orchestra of different cries touting tea, soup, samosas, books – even foot pumps and shoe repairs.An army of beggars shuffle through the carriages, parading various ailments in exchange for a coin or two. Meanwhile, third class sees hard wooden benches on offer, without designated seating, with each carriage filling like a can of sardines in no time.<p><p>The scenery on offer is frequently breathtaking, as the train weaves its way through a variety of landscapes.
