We talk with the organisers of Slush, Flow Festival and Nordic Business Forum.<p><p>Flow Festival visitors Ronja (left) and Aino say they don’t prioritise vegetarian food, but were just looking for a little snack – which turned out to be sweet potato fries from Soisoi.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>“Flow Festival is a carbon-neutral festival,” says Suvi Kallio, the managing director of the urban music festival that takes place every August in Helsinki (84,000 attendees in 2018). The festival considers sustainability in energy production, catering and transportation. It reuses and recycles materials, and encourages festival-goers to do the same.<p><p>“It’s obvious that this kind of an event causes emissions, especially the flights of the international artists,” says Kallio. “We compensate for the emissions by donating to renewable energy initiatives.”<p><p>In 2018 Flow’s emissions were offset by supporting Zimbabwe’s Kariba REDD initiative, which works to reduce emissions from deforestation and drought.<p><p>Nordic Business Forum (NBForum, 7,500 attendees in 2018), staged at the Helsinki Fair Centre in the Pasila district, has hosted speakers including Richard Branson and Barack Obama. The organisers believe that the most effective way to influence society as a whole is to inspire and equip business leaders who want to make the world a better place.<p><p>Empirical evidence shows that if you offer people a convenient option for sorting their garbage, they’re happy to have the opportunity; Flow Festival puts up stations with bins for metal and glass recycling; biodegradable waste; and mixed garbage bound for incineration.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>“It is important that we make business leaders understand the importance of leading with sustainable values,” says NBForum CEO Aslak de Silva.<p><p>The event, held every autumn, uses catering and waste disposal practices that reflect a desire to set an example. Print materials and stage setups are designed to be reused from one year to another. In 2018 NBForum committed to planting 7,500 trees – one for each attendee – to offset greenhouse gas emissions.<p><p>“We take sustainability into account in all decisions related to event production, programming and operations,” says Anna Pakkala, head of sustainability at annual startup conference Slush, the largest event of its kind in northern Europe (20,000 attendees including 2,600 startups and 1,600 investors).<p><p>In 2018 Slush is offsetting 10,000 tonnes of CO2 with the help of a Finnish energy company that has set up a solar-power project in India. This covers the whole event and related emissions such as the flights of the participants.<p><p>Like NBForum, Slush has grown from humble local beginnings to international status, and is also staged at the Helsinki Fair Centre. Slush gets its name from the prevalent weather in early December, when it takes place (December 4–5 in 2018).<p><p>Slush and Flow report to EcoCompass [a Finnish environmental management certification for small and medium-size enterprises] to track sustainability. “I also work with our teams to further integrate sustainability into the marketing, programming and offerings of our organisation on a year-round basis,” says Pakkala.<p><p>“It really bugs me when there’s plastic everywhere, so I’m glad all the plates and cutlery here are biodegradable,” says Riku while munching on a stir-fry at Flow Festival using wooden chopsticks.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>These events also rely on education and on making sustainable choices more attractive to their audiences.<p><p>“If we have the possibility to influence people, we want to use that in any way we can,” says Suvi Kallio. All Flow food venders offer vegan and sustainable meal options and participate in the Sustainable Meal initiative, a set of guidelines that direct attention to the ethicality and origin of the ingredients; energy efficiency in food production; logistics; and packaging material. The festival favours organic and locally produced food.<p><p>Catering entrepreneur Minna Väisälä has worked at Flow Festival for seven years. Her food stand, The Tasty Dogs, serves pork, lamb and seitan hotdogs, and French fries.<p><p>“We’ve developed our menu over the years together with the festival,” Väisälä says. Her festival sales are divided fairly evenly between the three varieties of hotdogs. In 2018, 46 percent of Flow visitors’ meal purchases were vegetarian or vegan.<p><p>Simple but effective: Each Flow Festival visitor may bring one empty bottle and refill it at the water stations, a practice that beats the Finnish summer heat and significantly cuts the amount of plastic waste the festival-goers generate.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>“Responsibility and friendliness to the environment have always been important values of the festival,” says Kallio, “but as the festival expanded we felt it would be good to start promoting and tracking environmental liability more systematically. Our audience is very aware, so our actions must be transparent.”<p><p>Of course, there’s still room for improvement. For Flow this means, most of all, increasing the recycling of compostable waste and reducing the amount of mixed waste, which a power plant incinerates to produce energy.<p><p>Sustainability is one of Slush’s core values, as well. “For several years it has been our key goal to set an example when it comes to sustainable event production,” says Pakkala, “even when it means that something might be a bit more difficult or costly to implement. We’ve also noticed that this is very much appreciated by people attending the event.”<p><p>By Anna Ruohonen and Tim Bird, November 2018<p><p>Compensating for carbon<p><p>Setting a good example<p><p>Food is more than fuel<p><p>Sustainability stems from the organisers<p>", "time": "2018-11-28T09:16:47+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "Zero isn’t nothing: Two Helsinki restaurants cut waste out of the picture - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/zero-isnt-nothing-two-helsinki-restaurants-cut-waste-out-of-the-picture/", "review": "", "content": "<p>“Food is political,” says Ossi Paloneva, head chef at Helsinki’s Loop Restaurant, where the surprisingly appetising menu is comprised of waste food – ingredients that stores would normally discard.<p><p>“I always thought it would be silly to work as a chef and not think of the bigger picture at all,” he says.<p><p>Estimates vary about how much food is wasted in Finland annually, but the Wastestimator project, carried out by National Resources Institute Finland from January 2016 to February 2017, puts the amount between 335 million and 460 million kilos. On average, restaurants account for as much as 70,000 kilos each year. Apart from any issues of morality or environmental sustainability, these levels of waste make no sense from a business point of view.<p><p>In Finland, the challenge of food waste persists in spite of relatively advanced awareness of the need to recycle and an infrastructure that supports recycling. Efforts on the Helsinki restaurant scene could set trends for the industry to erode the mountains of food waste.<p><p>Staff members at Loop Restaurant unload a van of ingredients that would have otherwise gone to waste.Photo: Niclas Mäkelä/Otavamedia/Lehtikuva<p><p>Loop is tucked away in a former hospital in Lapinlahti, a relatively undiscovered leafy backwater just a five-minute stroll from the metro station in the Ruoholahti neighbourhood. On a Monday at lunchtime, the restaurant is bustling, and satisfied diners are tucking in to a varied veggie buffet.<p><p>In spite of its slightly off-loop location, the restaurant has established a reputation with locals and more adventurous tourists. Even so, catering for events and functions is Loop’s mainstay.<p><p>“This is a crazy project, and a totally different kind of cooking,” says Paloneva, adding that profit is not the main motivation for this unusual enterprise, founded by an association called From Waste to Taste. “There are quite different rules at play with waste food. But perhaps the most surprising thing is that there is so much goodwill. It’s a hot topic and companies want to be associated with us.”<p><p>For renovations, Loop makes use of surplus construction materials donated by multiple companies. However, the most crucial contribution comes from the dozen or so stores across the Helsinki area that provide the food.<p><p>“We have drivers working daily to fill our van with waste food, mainly vegetables and fruit,” says Paloneva. “We adapt our menus to what is provided. For example, we received half a van full of cornflakes, and at first we thought, no, we can’t use this. But then we ground them into flour.”<p><p>“We don’t use any single-use plastic or anything that is not reusable,” says Luka Balac, one of three chefs who started Ravintola Nolla (Restaurant Zero).Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Another Helsinki restaurant, Ravintola Nolla (Restaurant Zero), starts from a notion opposite to that of Loop, advocating a quietly effective campaign against waste of any kind in its own operations rather than mitigating the waste of others. At the time of writing, Nolla is completing a move across town to premises in the trendy Punavuori neighbourhood, where it is set to reopen in early 2019.<p><p>Three chefs who converged on the Finnish capital’s restaurant scene from abroad form the brains behind Nolla: Carlos Henriques from Portugal; Albert Franch Sunyer from Barcelona; and Luka Balac from Serbia.<p><p>“All three of us come from strong roots of producing our own food,” says Balac, “and we all felt very strongly that something was basically wrong with how things have been done with respect to waste of both food and food packaging – especially plastic, which is a huge problem. We arrived at the concept of zero waste. We don’t use any single-use plastic or anything that is not reusable.”<p><p>This approach changes how everything is done, from menu planning to storage, but the idea is to make the concept part of the “package,” rather than using it as a sales gimmick or novelty.<p><p>Chef Luka Balac shows off the on-site superfast composter at Nolla; the compost goes to small-scale local producers who provide seasonal ingredients.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Walk-in diners will not necessarily know that the water glasses are fashioned from bottles discarded by the Presidential Palace – a small but fine example of the circular-economy approach. They might also be unaware that an on-site superfast composter gobbles up every morsel of food that customers don’t consume. The compost is returned to the small-scale local producers who provide the seasonal ingredients on the menu.<p><p>The uncompromising idea is to make zero waste normal and not the exception, ultimately even dissolving the draw of various apps that alert consumers to special offers on food that has passed its best-by date. Restaurants and stores need to change their management systems, says Balac, to make sure that overstocking doesn’t happen in the first place.<p><p>“Nobody else is doing anything like this anywhere in the Nordic area,” he says. “It’s unknown territory. In a couple of years, when we have shown that this is a viable business model, I think it’s going to be much more common.”<p><p>By Tim Bird, November 2018<p><p>What to do with half a van of cornflakes?<p><p>Aiming for 100% of zero<p><p>Uncharted territory<p>", "time": "2018-11-21T09:37:43+00:00", "type": "business"}

The environmental damage caused by this waste has reached a critical juncture.<p><p>Pressure is mounting to come up with feasible, environmentally friendly substitutes for single-use plastic in packaging that contains, protects and prolongs the life of food and other products.<p><p>In October 2018, the European Parliament approved a ban on a list of single-use plastic products, with another host of plastic products slated for reduction without a complete ban.<p><p>The future is potentially dazzling for companies that can provide convincing alternatives to plastic in large enough quantities and at an affordable price. Finland is home to several companies with their eyes on that prize. One of the best known is Sulapac, producers of an innovative packaging material of the same name. They make convincingly sustainable claims; they use wood grown in managed Nordic forests.<p><p>“Sulapac’s biggest advantage compared to plastic is that it is 100 percent biodegradable and microplastic-free,” says CEO and cofounder Suvi Haimi. “Sulapac outperforms other sustainable alternatives in terms of biodegradation speed, carbon dioxide footprint, barrier properties and unique appearance.”<p><p>Sulapac’s cosmetics containers are made out of a plastic-free, wood-based, biodegradable material that manufacturers can use with their existing machinery.Photo: Sulapac<p><p>“Plastic manufacturers can use their existing machinery with the material, so only minimal investments are needed,” says Haimi. “Sulapac solutions are oil-, water- and oxygen-resistant, and all biodegrade fully without leaving microplastics behind.”<p><p>Big brands, especially in cosmetics, are expressing interest in Sulapac materials, although the early champions of the material have been smaller Finnish brands. Niki Newd and Atopik are two companies that sell their skin products in Sulapac packaging.<p><p>“Eventually consumers drive the change and demand better sustainable alternatives, so I believe forerunner brands will be the winners,” she says. “We have already expanded our portfolio to foodstuff, and others will follow. Our first foodstuff customer is Fazer in Finland. We are also expanding beyond packaging, as converters can use our material with their existing machinery to create toys, consumer electronics or hygiene products, for example.”<p><p>Some consumers face difficulties in understanding what makes a truly sustainable product, she says. “For example, most biobased plastics are not at all biodegradable and release microplastics that will eventually end up in our bodies. Our thinking is that we should redefine materials and split them into microplastic-free and microplastic-releasing, to make it easy for consumers to choose. We want authorities, especially the EU, to emphasise to consumers what makes a truly sustainable choice.”<p><p>Cafés will seek any advantage to catch coffee-drinkers’ attention; customers are interested in the origin of the beans, but also want plastic-free recyclable cups.Photo: Kotkamills<p><p>Recyclable materials are being applied to a wide range of uses. Onbone, for example, is a Finnish company that has developed Woodcast, a nontoxic, self-adhesive, mouldable material for the casts and splints used to help heal broken bones. Woodcast is based on a combination of wood and biodegradable plastic.<p><p>As a consumer, it isn’t easy to follow your conscience and avoid making everyday purchases that don’t include some kind of plastic wrapping. Take one of the most common products: the cups of coffee that people buy on their way to work. Although a growing number of cafés are offering sustainably produced, fair-trade, organic coffee, the next link in the chain – disposable cups – still poses at least one glaring discrepancy for conscientious consumers: Cups are lined with a plastic “barrier” layer to stop them going soggy.<p><p>That’s one place where Finnish forest industry company Kotkamills aims to make a difference with a plastic-free alternative. Their cups use recyclable barrier products that they call ISLA. (The company’s other plastic-free food packaging, such as fast-food boxes, goes by the brand name AEGLE.)<p><p>The barrier layer in ISLA products is a water-based dispersion coating, explains Kotkamills CEO Markku Hämäläinen. The plastic-free products are easily recyclable in normal paper and board recycling, and the wood fibres can be reused fully.<p><p>“We want authorities, especially the EU, to emphasise to consumers what makes a truly sustainable choice,” says Suvi Haimi of Sulapac, whose plastic-free cosmetics containers decrease the burden on the environment.Photo: Sulapac<p><p>“The interest in Kotkamills’ ISLA products has been huge, and the market is ready for our plastic-free solutions,” says Hämäläinen. “Food service packaging plays an important part in modern, on-the-go lifestyles. Our mission is to make these disposable solutions as sustainable as possible. Today, too few disposables are recycled, even if they could be. So we are committed to developing easily recyclable barrier boards for the food service industry.”<p><p>Consumption and recycling are consumer choices, he says, but it is up to manufacturers to provide products that answer these challenges. “Kotkamills has also reacted by developing barrier board solutions especially designed for packages of takeaway food, chilled and frozen food, and bakery products. All these products are plastic-free and recyclable with normal paper and board waste.”<p><p>Just as Sulapac’s material is compatible with manufacturing equipment already in use, ISLA carton boards are also designed to run on existing cup-making machinery.<p><p>Sulapac sees itself as keeping ahead of the game. “We believe that our patented material and its manufacturing technology have a lead of between one and two years over main competitors,” says Haimi. “All competition is good, as it accelerates the development of the industry.”<p><p>She is upbeat about the future of her company: “I have always encouraged people to be open to new technologies, as they develop way faster than we think and have totally new potential to save this planet from plastic waste.”<p><p>By Tim Bird, November 2018<p><p>Consumers drive change<p><p>Sustainably served coffee<p><p>New potential to save the planet<p>", "time": "2018-11-05T07:58:12+00:00", "type": "business"}

When it comes to empowering kids, she does the equivalent of lifting horses one-handed (one of Pippi’s trademark tricks).<p><p>Liukas breezes into Löyly, a seaside sauna bar in Helsinki. She’s excited, arriving from the launch of her latest book, Hello Ruby: Expedition to the Internet (2017), which she pulls out of her bag.<p><p>It’s the third book in her award-winning Hello Ruby series, which demystifies coding and teaches children the basics of computational thinking. Written and illustrated by Liukas, the series recently won China’s top design prize, the Design Intelligence Gold Award, worth 130,000 euros.<p><p>“We need diverse input from all sorts of people, starting with kids,” says Linda Liukas.Photo: Elina Manninen/Keksi<p><p>However, describing Liukas as a “successful children’s author” is like saying Steve Jobs “sold computers.” She is a multitalented pioneer on a mission to inspire children to express themselves through technology.<p><p>“I wish there had been a book like Hello Ruby when I was growing up,” says Liukas. “Code is 21st-century literacy, and a growing number of world problems are starting to look like software problems – but software designers alone can’t solve them. We need diverse input from all sorts of people, starting with kids.<p><p>“Back in my childhood you had to choose between arts and maths. But why not choose both? Computers are meant for solving all sorts of problems. I see myself as equipping kids with creative thinking tools, not just teaching them to code.”<p><p>“Hello Ruby” uses all kinds of methods to teach kids about coding, including old-fashioned paper-and-scissors activities.Photo: Otso Kaijaluoto<p><p>Her journey from geek to world-famous writer has been “a serendipitous adventure” fuelled by a childhood passion for reading, drawing, and computing.<p><p>“In hindsight it seems obvious how these strands came together in my current work,” she says.<p><p>While other girls were pinning up posters of rock stars, Liukas had a “safe crush” on Al Gore.<p><p>“I was a little eccentric,” she says. “I taught myself coding so that I could create Gore’s Finnish fan site when I was only 13.”<p><p>Her passion for technology became a full-blown love affair after she and her brothers took apart the family laptop in the early 1990s.<p><p>“By fiddling with computers I learned that coding can be a creative tool for building worlds. My fearless curiosity about technology came from home.”<p><p><p><p>Excerpts from our interview with Linda Liukas, recorded on the patio of Helsinki seaside sauna bar Löyly.Video: ThisisFINLAND Magazine<p><p>With her voracious appetite for learning, Liukas pursued a diverse course of studies including philosophy, business, French and visual journalism. After studying at Stanford, she experienced a moment of revelation.<p><p>“In the United States I saw how people were truly using technology to change the world,” she says. She became inspired to launch Rails Girls, an initiative with the goal of “getting more women involved in IT.”<p><p>Rails Girls is now global, teaching women all over the world the basics of coding. A nonprofit community, it organises workshops and provides women with access to technology as a platform for unleashing their creativity.<p><p>“It’s simply about communication,” says Linda Liukas.Photo: Vesa Tyni<p><p>After Rails Girls came Hello Ruby, a concept Liukas hit upon while learning the open-source Ruby programming language. Whenever she had difficulty understanding a principle, she drew pictures of a red-haired girl called Ruby and asked herself, How would Ruby explain this?<p><p>The first book raised 380,000 dollars on Kickstarter, becoming the platform’s most highly funded children’s book. Hello Ruby: Adventures in Coding (2015) has now been published in at least 22 languages.<p><p>The third book in the series, Hello Ruby: Expedition to the Internet, is a pioneering attempt to make the web approachable to kids.<p><p>“The pessimistic way the internet is presented makes it seem like a dark, scary place,” Liukas explains. “My book shows that it’s simply about communication.<p><p>“I portray it as a snow castle – a metaphor that makes it more relatable. I never outgrew fairy tales, so I teach kids through storytelling.”<p><p>Ruby shows her readers a mouse.Illustration: Linda Liukas<p><p>When asked what personal qualities have made her such an inspiration to kids around the world, Liukas fires off a spirited reply.<p><p>“I’m curious,” she says with broad smile, “and when I stumble upon something interesting, I get very enthusiastic.<p><p>“My third strength is confidence. I have a strong sense of ‘Yes, I can.’ It’s the legacy of my childhood. I grew up reading books by Tove Jansson and Astrid Lindgren. Little My [one of Jansson’s plucky Moomin characters] and Pippi Longstocking are my mentors. We’ve always had a great diversity of role models in Scandinavia.”<p><p>Liukas is often described as a champion of female empowerment, but she insists that her core message is not just about feminism, but diversity.<p><p>“I love it when little boys in Japan tell me that their favourite character is Ruby, not the male character, Django,” she says. “It’s great that boys accept a girl as their hero. I want to bring girls into the world of technology, but by the same token I want to help boys accept different identities – to become nurses if they want to.”<p><p>Coding is like teaching computer chips how to behave, this picture seems to imply.Illustration: Linda Liukas<p><p>An incurable bookworm, Liukas reads at least one book a week, devouring everything from Harry Potter to Hemingway. Her sources of inspiration are eclectic, from yoga and Friday-night pizza to sparkling decorative unicorns.<p><p>“I spend so much time at the computer, so I like to connect with simple, earthy activities that ground me,” she says. “Otherwise my work life and personal life are very much intermixed. I try to emulate Tove Jansson, who saw art and life as one and the same thing.”<p><p><p><p>Liukas’s TEDx talk on children and computing has received almost two million views on the TED website alone.Video: TED<p><p>Liukas played an instrumental role in making coding part of the Finnish school curriculum.

Their solution is able to analyse data and make specialised predictions; uses range from increasing productivity at a forestry factory to finding out if a patient has prostate cancer.<p><p>Born in Ankara, Turkey, Gençoğlu came to Finland to pursue a master’s degree at Tampere University of Technology, where he extensively studied machine learning and deep learning.<p><p>“Machine learning is a subset of computer science, where algorithms analyse data, learn from it, and apply what they’ve learned,” he says. “Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which uses artificial neural networks.”<p><p>Gençoğlu explains artificial intelligence as “machines mimicking the cognitive functions of humans.” He comments that “people say ‘AI’ too much when they are referring to pseudoscience or science fiction.”<p><p>Machine learning can identify objects in images, or even recognise individuals. It can be taught to play games or chat with people. Gençoğlu’s doctoral dissertation deals with using machine learning to predict influenza epidemics based on social media posts.<p><p>From left: Hung Ta, Timo Heikkinen and Oğuzhan Gençoğlu draw up a plan.Photo: Hoang Minh Trang/Top Data Science<p><p>In 2016 Gençoğlu teamed up with Hung Ta, a Vietnamese mathematician with a PhD in biotechnology, and Timo Heikkinen, a Finnish entrepreneur with a background in software, to found Top Data Science, which specialises in machine learning. Now Gençoğlu is the head of data science for a company that has ten employees from six different countries.<p><p>“It’s definitely an advantage to be so diverse,” Gençoğlu says. “We work with many international companies, so if we are talking to a Chinese corporation it is a plus to have a Chinese speaker on our team.”<p><p>The company uses the multicultural background of their staff as a chance for team building. Every month they have a meeting with events, games, stories about their cultures, and food from their home countries.<p><p>“We offer AI as a service: tailor-made solutions to specific challenges,” says Gençoğlu. “If you go to one of the big companies in this industry, they will simply offer one of their plug-and-play products. We spend time to understand the client and the issue.”<p><p>Top Data Science has worked with a variety of industries, including forestry and imaging. It is based in GE’s Health Innovation Village in Helsinki, a home for dozens of health and wellbeing startups. Top Data Science’s ties to the health industry paid off when doctors at Helsinki University Central Hospital wanted to minimise biopsies and asked the company to develop software to diagnose prostate cancer from MRIs.<p><p>“We trained the algorithm using examples of MRI images and biopsy information,” Gençoğlu says. “Now when it is presented with new data, it is able to make predictions.”<p><p>People aren’t machines – humans learn differently. They need hobbies and work-life balance. Playing the guitar is one of Gençoğlu’s interests outside the office.Photo: Tiina Hautamäki<p><p>Another testing project involved discerning which patients were at risk of getting worse and which could be released from the intensive care unit. Top Data Science’s solution could be a valuable tool for doctors making these decisions.<p><p>Gençoğlu is pleased with the status of machine learning in Finland, but concedes there is work to do.<p><p>“Finland is a little behind the United States,” he says. “China is also very strong. We have lots of AI talent in Finland, but businesses are conservative and late to embrace it. Sometimes experts in Finland go to work in Silicon Valley or stay in academia.”<p><p>Yet some recent activities have increased the status of machine learning in Finland. For example, the University of Helsinki and consultancy company Reaktor have offered a free AI class called Elements of Artificial Intelligence, still available online at the time of writing.<p><p>“Elements of AI was a great idea,” says Gençoğlu. “It is important for the public to know how tagging people in pictures has trained Facebook’s facial recognition software, or how identifying spam in Gmail has trained Google’s algorithms. The public needs to understand how this works so they can have an impact on public policy.”<p><p>So does he worry about what social networks are doing with his data?<p><p>“I don’t have any social media accounts, except for LinkedIn,” he says. “The main reason is that I’m just not interested, but maybe I’m also a bit more conscious of privacy and how data is used.”<p><p>By David J.

It’s even used to coat silver jewellery to prevent tarnishing. Yet one of its biggest roles is in memory and logic chips.<p><p>“ALD is an enabler of Moore’s Law, the observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuit chips doubles about every two years,” Puurunen explains. “A key milestone was in 2007, when Intel began commercial use of ALD in its chips.”<p><p><p><p>This easy-to-follow Millennium Technology Prize video explains ALD and its applications with help from inventor Tuomo Suntola himself. Video: Technology Academy Finland<p><p>One of Suntola’s first jobs after university was working on a humidity sensor which required a thin film. This led him to wonder about other ways to create ultrathin films. When the medical instrument company Instrumentarium asked him for new product ideas, he knew just what to recommend.<p><p>“I proposed my idea and the management asked many questions,” Suntola says. “The CEO finally said, ‘I’m still confused but let’s do it.’”<p><p>The idea was to build up layers of different materials one atomic layer at a time, which guarantees uniformity even on complex three-dimensional shapes. He filed for a patent for his ALD invention in 1974.<p><p>“At the time we only had one goal, and that was to use ALD for flat panel electroluminescent displays,” says Suntola. “However, even at that early stage, I was thinking about its potential in semiconductors.”<p><p>Fundamental research in the technology has also been conducted independently in the Soviet Union, initiated by Valentin B. Aleskovsky and Stanislav I.

Mothers and fathers are increasingly expecting to dress their kids in current unisex styles. What’s more, they are seeking out individual designs by smaller companies, rather than the garments mega-chains offer.<p><p>“At the core of the current kids’ clothing trends, there is an increasing interest in values, in being as ethical and environmental as possible,” says Marika Westerlund, founder of Harakanpesä (Magpie’s Nest) Shop, a Helsinki-based Finnish design retailer whose mainstay has been children’s clothing.<p><p>“When this new wave of ethical, unisex children’s clothing first took off, the brands couldn’t meet customer demand,” she says. “Even now, the most popular items sell out within hours in online stores.”<p><p>Wildkind Kids offers gender-neutral, bold-print clothes that allow children to be wild, as the name implies.Photo: Johanna Laitanen<p><p>One brand with great prospects of growing internationally is Wildkind Kids, which is built around the idea of complete gender neutrality.<p><p>“We were first meant to design a Scandinavian-style clothing line, but somehow the prints just got a lot crazier, and now we’re all about bold prints and colours,” says Emilia Laitanen, who cofounded Wildkind Kids with her sister.<p><p>The clothes reflect the brand name. “The prints are wild, and the design of the clothes also allows kids to be wild,” says Laitanen. “We get a lot of our inspiration from skateboarding culture, since we used to skate and hang out with skaters as kids.”<p><p>Ghosts and animals figure in these patterns by Papu, a Finnish children’s clothing label founded on ethical principles.Photo: Mikko Ovaska<p><p>In a story similar to those of many other countries, Finland’s once-vibrant textile industry shrank drastically as imports from places with cheaper production costs took over. However, a relatively new textile company called Nokian Neulomo has seen several success stories.<p><p>When Finnish clothing brand Nanso decided to cease operations at its factory in the southwestern town of Nokia (yes, that Nokia), Nokian Neulomo stepped in to keep it going and continue employing people. It concentrates on sustainable, ethical production; it has its own line, Neulomo, and manufactures clothing for several other domestic brands, including Papu, Uhana Design and TAUKO.<p><p>Papu (the word means “bean” in Finnish), a children’s clothing label created in 2012, was one of the first brands in the field to be founded on ethical principles. “Starting out, I wanted to make an impact,” says designer Anna Kurkela, Papu’s founder.<p><p>At first, she had doubts about remaining in an industry often marred by human rights violations and environmental pollution. “I soon realised that the best way to affect it was from within, by doing things differently,” she says. Kurkela and her husband, Jussi Kurkela, are also minority shareholders in Nokian Neulomo.<p><p>This baby’s shirt shows one version of Vimma’s Braid design, which has become a modern classic. Vimma, Papu and Gugguu are some of the best-known Finnish children’s clothing brands, according to Marika Westerlund of Harakanpesä Shop.Photo: Mari Storpellinen<p><p>Now it seems that interest in unisex clothing is becoming more than a trend. As children’s clothing has traditionally been about allowing kids to move freely, it now allows them to think freely, too. And parents welcome that.<p><p>“I don’t want to offer my daughter preconceived roles that children are usually put into as soon as they’re born”, says Emilia Hernesniemi, fashion designer and cofounder of the R/H brand, as well as mother to Doris, one year old at the time of writing.<p><p>“I want Doris to be comfortable and wear whatever she likes to wear,” says Hannu Hirstiö, Doris’s father. “I know my daughter and what she likes to do, so I just try to pick clothes that allow her to be herself.”<p><p>Children aren’t the only ones who benefit from unisex clothing.

However, a clothes designer by trade, she wonders about sustainability and the future of the culture of consumption.<p><p>“We don’t necessarily need more useless things in this world, but we can improve the current solutions by ecological thinking,” she says. “For example, clothes could be recycled back into raw materials, or the whole garment industry could be revolutionised by 3D printing.”<p><p>By Nina Broström, February 2018<p><p>Staying warm is a huge deal<p><p>Clearing contradictory demands<p><p>Thinking big and small<p>", "time": "2018-02-15T11:17:10+00:00", "type": "business"}

About 400 conventioneers met up in a repurposed tram-maintenance hall. Among them was a young engineering student named Niklas Wahrman, from the southwestern Finnish city of Turku, there to present an idea by his software company Nixarn.<p><p>“At the time, I had several projects in mind,” Wahrman says. “I read online about this new startup event planned in Helsinki and contacted one of the organisers, Peter Vesterbacka [subsequently of Rovio and Angry Birds fame].

But attending Slush had changed my attitude and opened my eyes to different kind of life path by encouraging me towards entrepreneurship.”<p><p>The spirit has caught on in Finland. According to a 2016 poll by the Confederation of Finnish Industries (known by its Finnish abbreviation EK), about one-third of Finnish high school students said they would consider self-employment as a career choice. Fifteen years earlier, only one to two percent had been interested in founding their own businesses.<p><p>The Slush sign that went viral: “Nobody in their right mind would come to Helsinki in November.

{"title": "Finnish Arctic weather expertise takes trip to Pacific tropics - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/finnish-arctic-weather-expertise-takes-trip-pacific-tropics/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In February 2016, the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded roared through the South Pacific. With winds of 285 kilometres (175 miles) per hour, Cyclone Wilson devastated small, low-lying islands, causing 1.2 billion euros in damage. Forewarning is the key to surviving such a storm, and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) has been working with Pacific island nations to develop critical weather forecasting and warning services.<p><p>“This is really a unique area of the world,” says Matti Eerikäinen, project manager at FMI. “It is spread over a very wide area, and there can be huge distances between islands.”<p><p>Additionally, many of the islands are barely above sea level. Australian researchers have concluded that the sea in the area is rising by about ten millimetres (0.4 inches) annually, and climate change could result in stronger storms. The combination could see storm surges entirely overwhelm some islands.<p><p>“The collection and distribution of information is extremely important,” Eerikäinen says, “not just to protect property, but also to protect lives.”<p><p>FINPAC project coverage stretches over 14 countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.Map courtesy of FINPAC<p><p>The result is the Finnish-Pacific (FINPAC) project, coordinated through the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and supported by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs using development cooperation funds [full disclosure: the ministry also produces ThisisFINLAND]. The four-year project concluded in the summer of 2017.<p><p>Salesa Nihmei, a meteorology and climate officer of SPREP based on Samoa, explains that the project covered two main goals: to improve weather forecasting and to use that information better together with the local villagers.<p><p>“We wanted to reduce the vulnerability of the Pacific island countries’ livelihoods to the effects of climate change,” says Nihmei. “We improved the capacity of the countries’ national meteorological services to deliver weather, climate and early warning services. We did this in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, for the benefit of villagers in Pacific communities.”<p><p>The director of Tonga Meteorological Services, Ofa Fa’anunu (left foreground), talks with members of the community on Mounga’one Island. Photo: SPREP<p><p>You might wonder what Finnish meteorologists, who are used to dealing with blizzards and frozen seas, know about forecasting weather in the sunny South Pacific. Can expertise in foretelling snowfall translate to predicting typhoons?<p><p>“No, no,” Eerikäinen answers, laughing. “Forecasting tropical weather is indeed different from forecasting Finnish weather. We just provide the tools – they know their own weather.”<p><p>The tools include both automated and manual weather observation stations. FMI helped fix some old ones and also supplied spare parts. Additionally, it provided the SmartMet meteorological display system and SmartAlert severe weather warning system.<p><p>“The local meteorological services can use SmartMet for general weather forecasting,” Eerikäinen says. “They get lots of data on one platform, which they can digitally modify for forecasting in new formats. SmartAlert provides warnings in a standard map format. Third parties can use this information and update their own systems. People can get warnings delivered to Google Maps on their smartphones.”<p><p>In Epau, Vanuatu, community members discuss a risk map painted on the wall of the local school, showing potential flood areas, landslide danger and other information relevant to evacuation plans.Photo: SPREP<p><p>Yet FINPAC wasn’t simply a technical solution. Local meteorologists were trained in using the systems, but improving weather forecasting is no help if that information can’t be used effectively. One key was the involvement of news organisations.<p><p>“We also brought the media together with the meteorologists,” Nihmei says. “They discussed the opportunities and challenges of weather information and how to provide it in simple terminology or translate it into their own common languages.”<p><p>Local communities were involved in the entire process, all the way from initial planning to the installation of systems. The Red Cross helped with preparedness, emphasising the need to designate responsibilities during a storm and explaining how to tie down roofs. Large signs were erected detailing emergency numbers, how to gauge wind strength and which routes to take during evacuations.<p><p>“This was really a unique project,” Eerikäinen says. “We’ve never implemented a project down the whole value chain before and are very pleased with how it turned out. Finnish development aid is based on sustainability, so we are keen to continue support and build capacity in the region.”<p><p>By David J.

When these biobanks are linked with the single-payer healthcare system, in which every Finnish citizen is registered under one national programme, virtually the entire population structure can be mapped, grouped, and analysed. And because Finland has historically had a largely isolated and homogenous population, it provides exceptional opportunities for targeting genomic variations that underlie diseases.<p><p>Such a combination is invaluable to medical companies, both domestic and global.<p><p>“What the modern medical vision needs is big data,” says Dr Aarno Palotie, faculty member at the Centre for Human Genome Research in Boston and at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.<p><p>“Biobank samples, per se, are worthless unless they are linked with data. We have a healthcare system linked with social security numbers, which provides access to longitudinal healthcare over decades, something that isn’t possible in many places.”<p><p>Illustration: iStock<p><p>In Finland close cooperation exists between both public and private organisations and enterprises. The country has also been instrumental in the development of Europe’s legislation for the implementation and security of health-related data, as well as in refining domestic legislation – both of which are key for creating new methods and opportunities for research and innovation.<p><p>Thus, measures are being taken to bolster the country’s reputation as the premiere destination for medical research and business.<p><p>“There is a lot of governmental support,” says Palotie. “I would especially praise what the ministries have done to ease the regulatory burden here, especially for health-related studies.”<p><p>One example is the working group appointed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health to prepare to set up a genome centre. The centre’s tasks would include taking responsibility for the creation and development of a national genome database.<p><p>Sitra, the state-based Finnish Innovation Fund, spearheaded the implementation of the recently completed Medical Research Map, which aims to increase the transparency of the collaboration potential between global pharmaceutical companies and Finnish medical faculties. Support for the report has been high, with five Finnish medical faculties and 16 of the world’s largest pharmaceutical corporations contributing to it.<p><p>The report will be used to implement Finland’s health sector growth strategy, which has become increasingly important. Recent surveys indicate that the greatest area for potential cooperation between multinational pharmaceutical companies and domestic medical faculties is that of research related to cancer and cardiovascular diseases.<p><p>Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>The healthcare sector in Finland is ripe for growth. Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, estimates that investments into Finnish companies working in the wellbeing and healthcare sectors will reach into hundreds of millions of euros over the next five years.<p><p>The competition, however, is serious. The UK, for example, operates a biobank comprising half a million samples, and China is gathering samples from five to ten million individuals over the next decade.<p><p>Still, Finland’s data is unrivalled in quality and depth, and the studies are longitudinal, which means that they observe the same variables over periods as long as multiple decades. That, along with the isolated population structure, will be key for variety of study designs essential for drug development.<p><p>“Finland has a tradition of doing this type of research,” says Palotie. “Our data quality is superb, our health register data that provides longitudinal follow-up is unique, our infrastructure is top-class, and our legal and ethical and regulatory systems are more in sync with countries where big pharma headquarters are located.”<p><p>Getting a grip on medical data: BC Platforms offers data management and analysis software solutions integrating and analysing large amounts of genomic data together with sample and clinical data. Its customers consist of top-tier research groups, biobanks and major pharmaceutical companies collecting and analysing medical data. Recently BC Platforms extended its research partnership with the Centre for Molecular Medicine at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, to add capacity for large-scale next-generation sequencing.<p><p>Diagnosis before symptoms appear: LS CancerDiag’s DiagMMR technology also stems from academic research, in this case from that performed at the University of Helsinki. There researchers realised that most current Lynch syndrome (e.g. colorectal cancer) diagnoses rely on tumour studies, whereas the DiagMMR method enables diagnosis based on a non-invasive tissue sample before a person has developed any signs of cancer.<p><p>Faster, better, cheaper: The DNA sequencing method developed by Blueprint Genetics helps in analysing genes fast, with good quality and at an affordable price. Founded in 2012, the company is based on a technological innovation renewing a targeted sequencing method. The method is used to analyse genetic factors that cause a predisposition to disease.

The technology is miniaturised: smaller and smaller devices carry out increasingly demanding tasks.”<p><p>Praks explains that a hyperspectral imaging camera built by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd for remote sensing was launched along with Aalto-1.<p><p>“Whereas similar devices previously weighed 100 kilograms, our satellite’s camera weighs 600 grams.”<p><p>Several members of the Aalto-1 development team strike an informal pose with an early model of the satellite.Photo: Aalto-1 Project/Aalto University (cc by sa 4.0)<p><p>Thanks to the size of nanosatellites, one launch can include dozens of them. On April 18, 2017, the two-kilogramme Aalto-2 became the first Finnish-built satellite to be launched into space, part of an Atlas V launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. On June 23, 2017, Aalto-1 made it into space on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle sent up by the Indian Space Research Organisation.<p><p>The students, who built Aalto-2, now work at Reaktor Space Lab, a start-up company which designs, manufactures and tests small satellites.<p><p>Reaktor’s Director of Space &amp; Robotics Juha-Matti Liukkonen believes that small satellites will play a significant role in the IoT i.e. the Internet of Things:<p><p>“Small satellites will, for their part, produce essential data for the use of business. They will also extend the data network and information infrastructure to areas where these have not previously been available, such as to the Arctic Ocean.<p><p>“The crux of the matter is that multiple pairs of eyes can see more than one. A large number of small satellites can pass by the target more often and create a more real time situation picture.”<p><p>Satellites designed here: Reaktor Space Lab is the developer of the Aalto-2 satellite.Photo Tuomas Tikka<p><p>The use of space applications to respond to the Arctic’s growing demands is highlighted in Finland’s space strategy. Another objective is to use open geospatial data to strengthen the competitiveness of services.<p><p>In practice, Arctic expertise combined with space expertise can refer to the provision of accurate navigational data to vessels travelling in the Arctic or to information on changes to the area’s natural conditions. Arctic space expertise can also refer to the provision of accurate data on the Northern Lights for the use of tourism.<p><p>Space technology can in part help in finding solutions to critical problems that impact the world population as a whole. In particular, satellites will help us gain a better understanding of climate change and allow us to measure it.<p><p>“Solving global problems will require global situation picture. We now understand weather phenomena better than previously as we can model the entire globe’s weather at one time using satellite data,” Praks says.<p><p>“Satellites provide accurate information on things such as the volume of atmospheric gases, cloudiness, the melting of glaciers, changes to the tree line, the melting of permafrost, flooding and many other phenomena.”<p><p>According to the wildest visions, space technology could provide tools for mitigating climate change. These could include mirrors to be situated in space that reflect the sunrays as well as solar panels, from which emission-free power could be transferred to Earth via microwaves.<p><p>Aalto-1 orbits the earth, gathering and transmitting data (artist’s visualisation).Illustration: Aalto-1/Aalto University (cc by sa 4.0)<p><p>What will the future hold?<p><p>“Much will happen including things which we did not expect. Things will perhaps happen at a pace slower than what we would like. However, infrastructure to be situated in space will be a key part of global infrastructure,” Praks says.<p><p>“Hyperspectral imaging cameras on satellites will give, for example, a large Australian farming corporation access to accurate information on what is happening on fields in remote areas and when it would be optimal to send, for example, combine harvesters to the area.”<p><p>Small satellites alter satellite data into real time data – satellites allow us to receive real time data on such things as traffic and logistics.<p><p>“The satellite segment will be part of digitalisation.

The city feels like many Finnish cities, at least in the sense that it’s surrounded by woods, but different tree varieties dominate: shaggy black spruce with spindly trunks, and smooth, sturdy, white paper birch. The hills are much larger, and from some of them you can see the majestic mountains of the Alaska Range in the distance. Denali, North America’s highest peak at 6,190 metres (20,310 feet), is only about 250 kilometres (155 miles) away as the raven flies.<p><p>In this setting, Arctic Council working groups and other related organisations presented their most recent findings on protection of the marine environment; emergency preparedness and response; conservation of flora and fauna; sustainable development and more.<p><p>Although dealing with a direly urgent topic, the assembled diplomats, scientists, community leaders and researchers maintain a resolutely constructive, forward-looking attitude in the face of a sobering reality. Finland’s vision for its period as chair of the Arctic Council and beyond includes four priorities: environmental protection, connectivity, meteorological cooperation and education.<p><p>The experts at the Week of the Arctic emphasised repeatedly that humans must do everything possible to mitigate climate change – one of the simplest ideas could be to paint house roofs white to reflect sunlight back up. However, researchers are also evaluating methods of adapting. One of the Arctic Council working groups, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), presented a new set of reports under the title Adaptation Actions for a Changing Arctic.<p><p>“Adaptation is absolutely needed, but there is also a need for us to reduce our greenhouse gases,” says Sarah Trainor of the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, who is one of the many coauthors. “I don’t want to talk about adaptation without putting that forward as well.”<p><p>The 2017 Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska opened with music and dancing by indigenous people from the region.Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Lehtikuva<p><p>AMAP’s multidisciplinary approach includes looking at economic, technical, demographic and political factors and investigating ways that governments, civil society, businesses and academics could increase their ability to adapt to change. “What are the issues that are really important?” asks Annika Nilsson of Stockholm Environment Institute, another coauthor. “It turns out it’s not just climate change, there are a lot of other issues going on that concern local municipalities and local planners.” In other words, you have to combine the small picture and the big picture.<p><p>Rafe Pomerance leads Arctic 21, a network of scientists and Arctic climate advocates. He uses the term unravelling when discussing the Arctic reality, because the word “pulls all the pieces together and describes the state of the Arctic with regard to climate change.” The signs are there in the sea ice, the snow cover, the permafrost, the Greenland ice sheet and other Arctic glaciers. “All the trends are in the same direction: melting, thawing, shrinking,” he says. And it is only accelerating.<p><p>Pomerance and other attendees have had lots of experience convincing people in non-Arctic regions that these issues are important to everyone on the planet. “The fate of Florida, the fate of coastal areas around the world, is tied up with the fate of the Arctic,” he says.<p><p>To paraphrase a thought expressed by a number of researchers and delegates at the Week of the Arctic: What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic.

{"title": "Finnish designer empowers sustainable fashion - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/finnish-designer-empowers-sustainable-fashion/", "review": "", "content": "<p>It was the summer of 1986, and Timo Rissanen was 11 years old. It was a confusing time to be growing up in a suburb in Finland. You could no longer just step into a grocery store and fill your basket without thinking twice. A catastrophic accident had just occurred at a nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, in what is now Ukraine, and a cloud from the explosion had travelled north, reaching Finland.<p><p>Families had to take precautions when it came to putting food on the table – many people remember the temporary ban on picking berries or mushrooms. For the first time, Rissanen realised that the environment wasn’t just an abstract concept, but rather it was the water that he consumed and the air that filled his lungs.<p><p>Fast-forward about a decade, and Rissanen was attending the University of Technology in Sydney, Australia, studying design with an emphasis on fashion and textiles. He was fascinated when his undergraduate professor, Julia Raath, brought up in a discussion on the high toxicity levels in textiles and dyes.<p><p>A model shows off zero waste pyjamas designed by Timo Rissanen. The pattern ensures that the fabric is used as efficiently as possible.Photo: Mariano Garcia; pattern: Timo Rissanen<p><p>Rissanen’s subsequent work experience as a high-end designer became the validation he needed to put Raath’s education into context and connect it with his childhood experience. “I noticed that a lot of textiles and fabrics used were imported from countries like Bangladesh, China and India because they don’t have regulations when it comes to the use of toxic chemicals in manufacturing processes,” he says. “This not only affects the labourers, but also consumers who wear these fabrics, and eventually the environment.”<p><p>He also remembers the startling levels of waste produced: “Almost 15 percent of handwoven fabrics worth 200 dollars a yard, from countries like India or Italy, would be thrown aside,” he says. What he saw as a clear relationship between the environment and fashion inspired his Ph.D. research (also in Sydney) on sustainable fashion and zero waste. In 2011 he started teaching at Parsons School of Design in New York, where he was the first professor hired to educate the coming generation of designers on these two concepts.<p><p>A pattern and a person display a zero waste cardigan by Timo Rissanen.Pattern: Timo Rissanen; photo: Mariano Garcia<p><p>Currently, Rissanen works closely on the curriculum, ensuring that all of the elective courses in the School of Fashion cover sustainability to a certain degree. His biggest contribution has been developing a core freshman course in 2013 called Sustainable Systems. The course aims at arming future designers with in-depth knowledge on fashion’s relationships with water, soil, the atmosphere and climate change. “My biggest takeaway from Timo’s class was the ability to critically think about the design process when constructing a garment,” says 22-year-old design student Jacob Olmedo.<p><p>His classmate Casey Barber says, “I had never approached design with questions such as, ‘How will this garment look after three to five washes?’ and ‘Will it maintain its shape and texture?’ Since learning from Timo I have continued to explore creative construction methods such as zero waste pattern making and sustainable sourcing of materials.” Olmedo and Barber will form part of the first graduating class to have taken Rissanen’s challenging freshman course.<p><p>Rissanen’s career includes several book projects: He is one of the editors of “Shaping Sustainable Fashion” (Routledge, 2011) and one of the writers of “Zero Waste Fashion Design” (Bloomsbury, 2016).<p><p>Sustainable techniques are slowly being implemented within luxury brands, partly due to consumer awareness and pressure from organisations like Greenpeace, and also because massive profit margins allow them the ability to wean themselves off of toxic chemicals and hire trained labour. However, many popular high street brands still practice unsustainable, harmful techniques.<p><p>In addition, the current culture is one of fast consumption, where quantity takes precedence over the quality of the garments you own. It has been called the Instagram phenomenon, referring to the app where the lifespan of an image is two hours. It influences brands to constantly create new collections to appease consumers. “I know this is utterly depressing,” says Rissanen, but he is optimistic that within 20 years sustainable fashion and zero waste will “simply be good business practice.”<p><p>He’s continuing the good fight by training his future army of designers and taking his teachings beyond Parson. His projects have included co-curating the exhibition Yield: Making Fashion without Waste in 2011 and co-authoring the book Zero Waste Fashion Design (2016), both together with researcher and designer Holly McQuillan.<p><p>Rissanen believes that large-scale change starts on an individual level, and he has been gradually adopting sustainable techniques in his personal sphere: He brings his own grocery bags to the store, takes his food waste to a composting facility near his apartment in Queens, and makes his clothes last longer by avoiding use of a dryer. “Eventually, sustainability is the possibility that humans and other life can flourish on earth forever,” he says, quoting John R. Ehrenfeld, a scholar who co-authored the book Flourishing: A Frank Conversation about Sustainability (Stanford University Press, 2013) with Alfred J. Hoffman. “It’s simple in a way, but [it’s something] we can’t take for granted anymore.”<p><p>By Sholeen Damarwala, April 2017, updated May 2017<p><p>The link between fabric and environment<p><p>Fashion versus climate change<p><p>Letting life flourish<p>", "time": "2017-05-09T09:02:03+00:00", "type": "business"}

This is precisely the moment to develop our own expertise and to look for entirely new kinds of timber construction solutions,” says Katja Lähtinen, Finnish Professor of Business Economics and Wood Construction at the University of Vaasa.<p><p>Wood construction is a flagship project of the Finnish Government. The aim is to increase industrial wood construction and exports, but also the environmental and climate friendliness of construction. A wooden building acts as a carbon storage throughout its life – even hundreds of years.<p><p>From the beginning of next year, Finnish wood construction regulations, such as fire safety regulations, will be relaxed so as to allow wood to compete on an equal footing with concrete and steel.<p><p>For long, Finland’s strength in wood construction has been the construction of single-family homes and summer cottages. According to a recent study by the Pellervo Economic Research Institute, more than 80 per cent of detached houses in Finland have a wooden frame and practically all leisure homes are made of wood.<p><p>“A good example of a hybrid construction is Löyly in Helsinki. It is a sauna and restaurant building, where all materials have been left exposed. And that highlights the properties of wood even better,” says Lähtinen.<p>", "time": "2017-04-19T12:47:05+00:00", "type": "business"}

The radar images transmitted from space can be received in minutes or hours, not days.<p><p>Sometimes your life can be changed by a single event. That’s what happened in 2010 to Pekka Laurila, an Aalto University engineering student in his early 20s. Browsing online, he spotted a notification saying Aalto University Department of Radio Science and Engineering was running a new type of satellite course, aimed at building the first Finnish satellite. [Editor’s note: On April 18, 2017, Aalto University’s two-kilogramme Aalto-2 became the first Finnish-built satellite to be launched into space, part of an Atlas V launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.]<p><p>Little did Laurila know that he would later become the CFO and co-founder of Iceye, a startup with 20-plus employees. It’s meant for developing real-time radar imaging services delivered straight from space via microsatellites launched into orbit in a carrier rocket.<p><p>Iceye’s founder Pekka Laurila is ardently in love with satellites.Photo: Iceye<p><p>Yes, it’s partly rocket science. And from a wider perspective, it’s innovative commercial space technology that could change the way shipping lines monitor the sea ice and iceberg situation in Arctic seas, the way rescue crews get timely information on flood and storm damages and oil spills. Ultimately, this satellite-based radar imaging technology could even help us map other planets for resources.<p><p>But let’s not get ahead of things. Let’s go back to the days when Laurila was attending the university satellite course. How did he end up establishing a business of his own with two other students in 2012?<p><p>“In the student satellite project we realised you don’t need a lot of people and money to build a satellite. Later we started looking for ways to utilise this new satellite technology commercially, and came up with various ideas. There was big demand for services where our earth imaging expertise could be put to use,” Laurila says.<p><p>“One particular application area – Arctic seas and monitoring of the ice situation – stood out from the rest. There was strong demand for this from potential customers.”<p><p>Having completed the business course, Laurila and his mates embarked on a two-year validation project. It was aimed at building a prototype to demonstrate the technology required for providing the envisioned radar imaging service.<p><p>“Iceye is a spin-off of this prototype project. Since we made the original prototype at Aalto University, they are one of the owners of our company. Aalto University has good and transparent technology transfer rules, and everything worked out really well,” he says.<p><p>Iceye offices are still located on Aalto University campus, allowing Iceye staff to work in close collaboration with the University’s Space Technology group.<p><p>Photo: Jari Kokkonen/Vastavalo<p><p>Arctic seas are vast areas where infrastructure is sparse and little real-time information is available on the environment.<p><p>If an oil rig is drilling for oil, the owners need to know in real time how sea ice moves. If shipping lines and oil companies want to see the location of ice and cracks in real time, they have to send out a helicopter or an airplane, which is costly. But the risk involved in a vessel and its cargo getting stuck in ice is so big that the owners are willing to invest in getting ice information quickly.<p><p>Few governmental radar satellites exist, but their updating speed for ice information is low. In an operation, one image per day is not enough.<p><p>Small satellites are the answer because they are made of ordinary off-the-shelf components that can make them up to hundred times cheaper than governmental weather satellites. With lower unit cost, they can be operated in a swarm that delivers good quality images more often.<p><p>When the technology and business plan started taking shape, it turned out the system could do a lot more than serve only the Arctic seas. It was time to shift the focus into doing more global business.<p><p>“It’s still early days. So far we have made a Proof of Concept satellite, and later in 2017 we hope to be able to demonstrate it in orbit,” Laurila says.<p><p>“The best benefit we offer is speed. When you need images from a flooded area, you must get information fast. Our timescale is hours, not days,” he says.<p><p>To get the update speed, several satellites are needed. A swarm of approximately six satellites is required to cover arctic sea areas.<p><p>Iceye manufactures the satellites and delivers them to a commercial launching firm that loads them into a carrier rocket which takes them into orbit.<p><p>“Our business is growing continuously. For us, big-scale global business is the only option. In five years’ time, we must have at least 20 satellites in the sky. That’s a realistic goal.”<p><p>By Leena Koskenlaakso, ThisisFINLAND Magazine 2017<p><p>Innovative space technology<p><p>It’s all about updating speed<p><p>Growth is the only option<p>", "time": "2017-04-19T06:32:54+00:00", "type": "business"}

They rightly detail the horrors refugees face, or describe how the host country is struggling to cope. The organisation Startup Refugees certainly thinks so.<p><p>“Startup Refugees was conceived by Riku Rantala and Tuomas Milonoff,” explains Camilla Nurmi, coordinator for the program. “During the filming of their Madventures travel series they came across new talents and skills that Finland did not have. They realised that refugees to Finland were a brain gain instead of just a social and financial challenge. These refugees could bring new business ideas into Finland.”<p><p>At Slush, some Startup Refugees members make and sell bracelets with customised messages.Photo: Kai Kuusisto/Slush<p><p>The response to Startup Refugees was enthusiastic: within two weeks the project had signed up government ministries and departments, NGOs, private individuals and more than 250 companies to offer their services. The refugees loved the idea as well.<p><p>“During our first visit to a reception centre, everyone was interested,” Nurmi says. “We gathered their skills and background and asked what they wanted to do. Now we have collected over 1,000 profiles in six cities and have over 20 reception centres wanting to participate next.”<p><p>Once a refugee has filled out a profile, his or her needs are matched with what the program’s partners have offered. The Startup Refugees website lists more than 70 partners – organisations such as mobile gaming company Supercell, think tank Demos, Hanken School of Economics, mentor-on-demand app Heippa and Aalto University’s Startup Centre, as well as several government ministries.<p><p>Refugees can seek legal help, advice on bureaucracy, mentors, networking and funding for their business ideas. While all these things are necessary for living in Finland or opening a business, refugees can get something even more important from the program.<p><p>Slush gives the members of Startup Refugees the opportunity to meet and network with thousands of other entrepreneurs, investors and students. Photo: Esa-Pekka Mattila/Slush<p><p>“Startup Refugees is amazing,” says Mustafa Abdulameer. “It changed my life. Without their support I couldn’t develop myself, educate myself or discover more skills about myself.”<p><p>Abdulameer comes from Iraq. He is an energetic person, but found himself in a Finnish refugee centre with nothing to do. This forced inactivity was frustrating, mentally debilitating and depressing. When he heard about a new program looking for volunteer translators he immediately signed up.<p><p>All of Abdulameer’s boundless energy suddenly found a positive outlet. He quickly became involved in Startup Refugees, working as a translator, organising data collections and helping other refugees with all sorts of things.<p><p>“I don’t like to say I help anyone,” Abdulameer says. “I simply share what help others have given me. If I receive some useful knowledge, I have to share it with others.”<p><p>Customers can pick their messages for these customisable bracelets made by the people of Startup Refugees. A sample bracelet reads “life seeker.”Photo: Jussi Hellsten/Slush<p><p>Startup Refugees has fully immersed itself in Finland’s well-developed startup ecosystem. The refugees have a variety of business ideas, such as repairing mobile phones or making traditional handicrafts from their home countries.<p><p>“One great idea is Baghdad Barbers,” Nurmi says. “The Middle East has a fantastic beard tradition, but here people don’t know how to take care of beards. Hipsters with big beards can go to Baghdad Barbers and get grooming techniques that Finland does not have. There are also services for Muslim women who can get their hair done in private.”<p><p>Abdulameer has found several jobs through Startup Refugees; he has worked with Baghdad Barbers and he has done modelling. The program has also helped him to overcome his fear of public speaking. He has pitched his business idea in front of audiences and even found himself sharing a stage with government ministers.<p><p>“I have a five-year plan,” he says. “I want to start my own import-export business. I don’t mean only products or technologies, but even ideas and systems. Finland has so many amazing things that would solve problems in my native community. I also want to continue my education and get a master’s degree. Finally, I want to continue working with Startup Refugees.

Here Henna Tyynismaa and her team are studying the genetic causes of a group of diseases characterised by progressive stiffness and spasticity of the lower limbs. The Petri dishes contain patients’ motor neurons that have been differentiated from skin cells that were first reprogrammed into stem cells.<p><p>“Motor neurons are much easier to study in a dish than in a patient’s body!” quips Tyynismaa, a rising star in the research of genetics and molecular neurology.<p><p>Rapid advances are being made in this emerging field, including innovations in testing methods that enable scientists to pinpoint the genetic causes of medical disorders and – eventually – develop precision treatments for individual patients.<p><p>“When we started this research four years ago, it was uncharted territory in Finland. Since then, we have found several mutations that are causing these axonal disorders. Some are triggered by as many as 70 different genes. We have even found new, previously unknown genes,” Tyynismaa says.<p><p>“Our experience with rare diseases will help us solve the mysteries of the common ones,” says Henna Tyynismaa.Photo: Aleksi Poutanen<p><p>Tyynismaa’s work is part of a paradigm shift that is going on in the clinical world today.<p><p>“Thanks to next-generation gene technology and the shrinking cost of reading DNA, the next five years will bring major developments to our understanding of the mechanisms that cause diseases,” the researcher states.<p><p>In the not-so-distant future, a routine visit to the physician could be radically different from the one-size-fits-all approach of today.<p><p>“Tomorrow, when a patient comes to a clinic with certain symptoms, instead of performing the traditional run of expensive tests, we will simply use genome sequencing to identify the mutant genotypes responsible for the disorder,” predicts Tyynismaa.<p><p>This is what is called personalised medicine: an approach that emphasises the uniqueness of each patient’s particular disease risks.<p><p>While genomic diagnostic methods are advancing rapidly, a vast amount of work still needs to be done before DNA sequencing can be applied routinely to deliver targeted cures for individual patients.<p><p>“But every time we identify a disease gene, we understand a little bit more about the underlying mechanisms. This doesn’t translate directly into treatments yet, but there have been cases where we have been able to offer suggestions – for instance we can target a known pathway with an existing drug. These cases are rare, but it’s a promising start,” she says.<p><p>Tyynismaa believes Finland has the potential to become a global leader in genomic diagnostics.<p><p>“But we have to convince policymakers that it’s a cost-effective option,” she says.<p><p>A clear advantage for Finland – in addition to being an established forerunner in genetic research – is its well-organised healthcare system.<p><p>“Luckily people in Finland are very willing to participate in genetic studies,” says Tyynismaa.<p><p>Another goldmine for medical researchers is Finland’s unique gene pool.<p><p>“It’s very limited, and we have specific diseases that aren’t present anywhere else, which is excellent for research. There has been lots of overseas interest in Finnish biobanks,” she says.<p><p>Photo: Aleksi Poutanen<p><p>With quiet determination, Tyynismaa has steadily risen to the forefront of her field.

From the day I realised that there are people who research for a living, I knew it was the life for me,” she says. Tyynismaa modestly credits her success to “patience, hard work and Finland’s education system.”<p><p>She also praises pioneers such as the late Leena Peltonen-Palotie, one of the world’s most influential geneticists.<p><p>“Leena was a tremendous inspiration to many of us.

This is the question Reetta Kivelä, Gold&amp;Green Foods’ co-founder set her mind to when she started her work with pulled oats.<p><p>We want to provide a genuine alternative to meat and in our own way help to reduce the unsustainable mass production of meat. We firmly believe that we as a company – like each individual – can have an impact on global phenomena such as climate change,” says Dr. Reetta Kivelä, 39, co-founder and chief technology officer of Gold&amp;Green Foods, and one of the developers of the startup’s hit product, pulled oats.<p><p>Climate change is a driving force behind Gold&amp;Green Foods’ values. Reetta Kivelä admits that she has a weakness for trying to save the world. She became a vegetarian in high school, but as a young adult and active athlete, had to consider whether her diet was providing her with enough protein. “Since then, I’ve eaten based on who I’m with and what’s served. I don’t want to be difficult when people have gone to the effort of preparing food,” Kivelä says.<p><p>Photo: Kreetta Järvenpää<p><p>Kivelä’s doctoral dissertation on processing oats was accepted with honours by the University of Helsinki’s Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry in 2011. When she took job-alternation leave from Finland’s largest sweets and bakery company, Fazer, she was ready for new ideas. She met up with Maija Itkonen, a high school friend who was already an acclaimed startup entrepreneur and co-founder of Aalto University’s Design Factory. Itkonen suggested they should team up to create “oat meat.”<p><p>“At first the idea sounded rather unappealing,” Kivelä recalls with a laugh. “But soon we started to move forward with the idea of ‘perfect protein’.”<p><p>Their research work led to a vegan product made of oats, fava beans, and peas. The natural taste of the product is smooth and fits naturally in many dishes being perfect for busy families. The manufacturing process of pulled oats is a secret Kivelä and her business associates adapted from China. It includes only mechanical processing such as mixing, pressing and heating.<p><p>Kivelä says that at first the name “pulled oats” was a joke, but early customer focus groups liked it.<p><p>“So our ‘working title’ became the official name,” she says.<p><p>The entrepreneurs obtained startup funds from Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, and facilities for product development at Aalto University. Kivelä says it’s great that there have been people who believed in the fledgling firm from the beginning.<p><p>“We set up the company in 2015 under the name Oat Kitchen, but changed it to Gold&amp;Green Foods that autumn. I’m amazed that we’ve been able to achieve so much in such a short time – though it has required some sleepless nights,” she says.<p><p>Earlier Kivelä didn’t have a particular passion for oats, but she does now.<p><p>“Oats are a gentle grain compared to rye, for instance. And oat fibre is unique. It has a lot of protein, healthy fats, and antioxidants, so its health benefits are incomparable,” says Kivelä.<p><p>Finland is a significant producer of oats in global terms.

On dry land she more commonly goes by the name of Anni Perttula, though water is clearly her true element: “I’ve lived by water all my life, and I’ve always loved swimming, even in the winter,” she says. “I get a bit anxious when there’s no water nearby.”<p><p>Quick to startle, a mermaid dives out of reach with a swish of her tail.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>Perttula first got the idea of becoming a professional mermaid a few years ago when she read about mermaid performers working in Florida. “I love entertaining people, and especially working and playing with children, so it’s a dream job for me,” she says.<p><p>Her friends initially worried whether she could make a living from her mythical alter ego, but as Riia’s popularity increased, Perttula was able to quit her more mundane terrestrial job as a store manager and become a fulltime mermaid. Her courses and shows are now in great demand at spas and swimming pools around the country.<p><p>Performances for younger children include lots of storytelling and roleplaying, with an assistant keeping a close watch for safety’s sake.

That changed a few years ago when an active citizen, Kari Hietala, came up with an idea to attract people during the cold months, too. He took it upon himself to plough a track on the frozen lake and arranged sponsorship in the form of kicksleds donated by local enterprises – because icy conditions require their own means of transport, and some people don’t feel like skating.<p><p>A typical kicksled looks like a chair with handles on top and two long sled runners underneath. You push with one foot, similarly to a scooter, and glide along with one foot on each runner. The chair provides room for a bag or even a passenger, or just a place to sit when you take a rest.<p><p>Hietala’s motivation was very simple. “I wanted to bring more life to the lake during winter,” he says. “My goal was to get people moving, regardless of their physical abilities, and get them enjoying the beautiful wintery landscape nature has provided us.”<p><p>The kicksledding tradition in Finland stretches back to well before the country gained independence in 1917. A manageable mode of movement for everyone from kids to senior citizens, kicksleds are perfect for navigating village walkways and country lanes covered with packed snow.<p><p>Finland’s official Kicksled emoji: Kicksleds are for all age groups and offer a convenient form of transport if you live in a town where the walkways are covered with packed snow.Illustration: ThisisFINLAND<p><p>The ploughed route on Köyliönjärvi stretches ten kilometres (6.2 miles) in a long loop with a campfire site at each end, and it’s free of charge. All you need to do is bring your own sausages for the grill. Nothing beats a freshly barbequed, smoky sausage with mustard, consumed in the crisp winter air on a sunny day after some outdoor exercise.<p><p>The ice of Köyliönjärvi also possesses bloodstained historical connotations: Legend has it that in the mid-12th century, a Bishop Henry, an Englishman, died there as a martyr after being stationed in Sweden and then in Finland. He is said to have been murdered on the frozen Köyliönjärvi by an enraged peasant named Lalli. It’s uncertain whether Lalli actually existed, and the circumstances of Henry’s death are unclear; nonetheless, Lalli has his place in Finnish history.<p><p>These days, it’s hard to imagine such a bloody scene on Köyliönjärvi. On a typical winter day, the route is buzzing with happy people enjoying the fun on kicksleds or skates.<p><p>Here’s your kicksled and there’s the track. Go for it!Photo: Mari Storpellinen<p><p>“This route has been running for several years already,” Hietala says. “But as a part of the Finland 100 celebrations, the number of kicksleds has now been increased accordingly.”<p><p>To mark the occasion, local enterprises were generous in financing additional kicksleds to bring the fleet to the full 100. As the municipality has devoted energy to publicity, the amount of people visiting the lake has multiplied.<p><p>Visitors can write their comments down and put them in feedback boxes near the track. “According to that feedback, we have had more than 10,000 visitors this year,” says Lauri Parviainen, Säkylä’s secretary of sports and leisure activities, in an interview at the end of February. However, not everyone puts a piece of paper in the feedback box, so he guesses that the actual number is much higher.<p><p>“With clever advertising, the municipality has made this place more widely known,” he says. “Social media has been a major factor, with people posting about how much they’ve enjoyed it here.”<p><p>The season lasts from two to three months, depending on the year. “These activities are dependent on the ice being thick enough,” Hietala says. “The lake follows the laws of nature, so we follow them, too.”<p><p>By Mari Storpellinen, March 2017<p><p>Violent past, pleasant present<p><p>Popular pastime<p>", "time": "2017-03-09T08:31:31+00:00", "type": "business"}

Suddenly the sound of raucous and infectious laughter comes from the radio, when the DJ plays a comedy song by the Finnish artist Vesa-Matti Loiri. The cackling laughter distracts Koskimäki from his endeavours, and he realises how late it is.<p><p>“It was quite an absurd situation, and it really made me wonder whether there was any sense in what we were doing,” Koskinen recalls, remembering how long and hard he worked on his research, which has now been completed.<p><p>Anna Maria Pirttilä (left) and Janne Koskimäki studied pine buds for almost a decade, running 132 experiments and writing 160 drafts before their article was published.Photo: University of Oulu<p><p>Opportunities for exciting new medical innovations may lie within the buds of coniferous Scots pine trees, which grow extensively in Finland. Anna Maria Pirttilä and Janne Koskimäki from the University of Oulu, 600 kilometres (370 miles) north of Helsinki, have researched bacteria found in pine buds for nearly a decade and recently published a breakthrough article. <p><p>It all started with a doctoral research study in which plant microbiologist Anna Maria Pirttilä examined how Scots pines could be cloned from buds. “My study also revealed that the bacteria and yeasts present in pine buds evidently produce certain compounds that benefit plants – so I wanted to know what these compounds are,” she says.<p><p>Pirttilä enlisted Janne Koskimäki, who had just finished his postgraduate studies, and the two scientists got to grips with pine buds over the next eight years. As often happens in such research, their work changed direction after unexpected findings.<p><p>Koskimäki and Pirttilä’s work reveals how bacteria function inside plants. In relation to the human body, we’re used to the idea that lactic acid bacteria, for instance, benefit our digestive systems. But much less is known about what the bacteria living inside plants actually do.<p><p>“We have a lot to learn about the microbes found in plants – and it’s still a new and little-known idea that microbes even exist inside plants,” explains Koskimäki.<p><p>Pirttilä says, “People can get quite hysterical about microbes, but there are masses of them all around us, and only a tiny proportion of them cause diseases.”<p><p>“For researchers, doing new science is a passion just like the creation of a new artwork is for an artist,” says Pirttilä.Photo: University of Oulu<p><p>Pirttilä likes to go walking in the forest in her spare time. This helps her to relax, but observing the natural world also adds perspective to her research. Koskimäki likewise enjoys getting away from it all by going hiking or spending time in a simple cabin in the woods.<p><p>“One thing that’s always fascinated me in nature is the way everything is interrelated, with different species living together interdependently, in symbiosis,” says Pirttilä. Such linkages also became evident inside pine buds, where host cells and bacteria interact beneficially.<p><p>Plant cells and human cells defend themselves against harmful bacteria in similar ways, by producing oxygen radicals in the inflamed area. This process often leads to an overreaction, when the organism or body wants to stop bacteria getting deeper into tissue.<p><p>But oxygen radicals are a crude defence mechanism, since they also damage the host organism’s cells. Pirttilä and Koskimäki’s research has nevertheless revealed that bacteria are able to defend themselves even against the most toxic oxygen radicals, by internally generating long-chain fatty acids called polyhydroxybutyrates. When an inflammation occurs, bacteria can break down these fatty acid chains into smaller sections that can be used to combat oxygen radicals.<p><p>Their research project received funding from the Academy of Finland, which operates under the Ministry of Education and Culture. The study’s findings appeared in the journal Nature Chemical Biology in March 2016 in an article entitled “Methyl-esterified 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomers protect bacteria from hydroxyl radicals.”<p><p>In the middle of a pine forest, Janne Koskimäki shows off a moustache made of moss.Photo: University of Oulu<p><p>Damage caused by oxygen radicals lies behind serious clinical conditions including Alzheimer’s disease and macular degeneration, an eye disease. But the bacteria found inside pine buds are able to generate compounds that can effectively combat the toxic oxygen radicals that cause these problems. This discovery could open up opportunities to develop new medicines.<p><p>Pirttilä and Koskimäki now aim to devise medical innovations for treating age-related macular degeneration and other conditions affecting the back of the eye, through collaborative research bringing together the University of Oulu and the University of Eastern Finland.

{"title": "Bengt Holmström becomes Finland’s newest Nobel winner - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/bengt-holmstrom-becomes-finlands-newest-nobel-winner/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The Finnish economist, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wins the honour together with his British colleague, Harvard professor Oliver Hart. Announced in October 2016 and awarded at a ceremony on December 10, it recognises their work on contracts and incentives, trying to answer tough questions such as:<p><p>How can an employment contract motivate someone to work hard but not take unwise risks? How can that employee be properly compensated for her performance but not for matters outside her control?<p><p>For many economists, it was about time Holmström won the Nobel Prize. “I think my first reaction to the news was ‘Finally!’” says Topi Miettinen, professor at Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki. “The chance that he would win the prize has been discussed for a long time. Everyone at Hanken was very positive. As soon as I heard he won I decided to have a special session in my microeconomics class about Bengt’s moral hazard ideas.”<p><p>To explain “moral hazard” Miettinen describes the owner and CEO of a company. The owner wants the CEO to work hard but can’t fully monitor him. The risk-averse CEO would ideally like a constant salary, but the owner provides an incentive contract which ties the CEO’s pay to profit. However, the CEO can’t fully control profit and dislikes uncontrollable risk. The CEO has to be compensated for bearing the risk, and this makes the incentive contract expensive for the owner.<p><p>Oliver Hart (left) and Bengt Holmström smile for the cameras after delivering their Nobel Prize lectures in Stockholm on December 8, 2016.Photo: Claudio Bresciani/TT/Lehtikuva<p><p>Holmström’s ideas are easily explained using executive contracts as examples, but Miettinen points out they can be applied to many different fields. Auto insurance is another example: If your car is insured there must be some other incentive for you to drive carefully. After all, if you damage your car the insurance company, not you, will pay for the repairs.<p><p>“Bengt has also extensively studied the multitasking problem,” Miettinen continues. “A teacher is given incentives to teach well, such as tying pay to the students’ exam results. But in this case the teacher focuses on teaching the students to get good scores on the exam, not to get a good education. It is difficult to use incentive pay when there are multiple tasks to perform.”<p><p>Although Holmström has spent much of his career at MIT, he still retains strong ties to Finland. He has served on the boards of the Finnish Business and Policy Forum (known by its Finnish abbreviation, EVA), Aalto University and Nokia.<p><p>“I’m happy he made it,” Miettinen says. “There has been a lot of public interest in economics because he won the prize.

Yet Slush CEO Marianne Vikkula is adamant that it is not an event. Instead, Slush is a movement.<p><p>It began when 300 people gathered in Helsinki to discuss entrepreneurship and technology during the dark days of 2008. The Finnish winter weather wasn’t the only reason for the darkness; the global financial crisis was blooming and many countries entered deep recessions.<p><p>These young Slush participants, many of whom were students, wanted a new way of life. Instead of the traditional career path of working for big corporations, they planned to be entrepreneurs. This idea had, and still has, immense appeal: at latest count 16,000 people from all over the world, including entrepreneurs, investors, students and media, take part in the annual Slush Helsinki. In addition, Slush organises numerous gatherings in locations as far-flung as Singapore, Shanghai and New York.<p><p>Slush organises gatherings in many different countries; there is time for both business and fun, such as this saber tag match at Slush Singapore.Photo: Melvin/Slush<p><p>“The biggest impact we have had is definitely the culture,” says Vikkula. “Just look at how the media sees entrepreneurship now. What is even more dramatic is with the youth. Their goal is to run their own businesses.”<p><p>Pekka Ilmakunnas, professor of economics at Aalto University, agrees. He believes it’s a good thing that both the Finnish government and grassroots movements encourage owning your own business. Still, change happens slowly and we can’t expect miracles.<p><p>“Slush and other efforts to encourage entrepreneurship result in startups, many of which are short-lived,” Ilmakunnas says. “Among those which survive, only a few grow fast to become significant employers. It is important that we have startups, but we cannot hope that they quickly solve our unemployment problems.”<p><p>At Slush, great ideas hover in the air, appearing over people’s heads like lightbulbs in a cartoon.Photo: Jussi Hellsten<p><p>Finnish startups have gained attention around the world: gaming powerhouse Supercell, internet-of-things specialist Enevo and healthtech pioneer Blueprint Genetics are just a few examples. Global investors are now eyeing these and other young companies. In 2015 about one billion euros of venture capital was invested in Finnish startups.<p><p>“Finland now has the highest rate of early-stage venture investment in proportion to GDP in Europe,” Vikkula says. “Many of those deals happened at Slush. In the years 2013 to 2015, investor meetings at Slush resulted in more than 500 million euros of funding for startup companies. Out of that, Finnish firms received about 200 million euros.”<p><p>While Slush has shown its worth in attracting venture capital, Vikkula says it is now rising to meet more challenges. One major issue is getting the best talent to work in startups. She explains that Slush wants to encourage young Finns in their education, as well as attract skilled immigrants to work in Finland.<p><p>Ilmakunnas stresses that it will take a variety of measures to ensure robust health for the Finnish economy in the future.<p><p>“There are foreign firms starting activities in Finland,” Ilmakunnas says. “However, in the long run it is also important to have new domestic firms that grow and increase employment. Over time it is research and good education which bring competitiveness.”<p><p>Trying to see what the future holds: With the Nokia stand visible in the background, a Slush participant tests a Samsung product.Photo: Jussi Ratilainen<p><p>Movements like Slush exert their own broad impact on the economy over time, but Slush also remains extremely important on the level of individual companies.

After a break to devote time to his kids while they were small, he’s now increasing the amount of time he spends on his business.<p><p>He makes woolly pipo hats and beanies by hand, and wears the wintry accessories all year round. “A pipo is a natural extension to whatever you wear,” he says. “In a slightly anarchic spirit, I often like to wear a pipo indoors – though I’ll always take it off when heading for the dining table.”<p><p>In a workshop in the northern Finnish city of Oulu, Putkonen’s industrial-scale sewing machine thrums almost round the clock when he has a big order to meet. Some 15 kilos (33 pounds) of cloth has just arrived from the factory, and the customer has set a tight deadline for the delivery of this batch of woolly hats. “When the last pipo is ready,” he says, “I’ll clean up and stop to think: There goes another bunch of hats, out into the big wide world.”<p><p>Finnish knitwear firm Nevertex is another long-standing player in the “pipo” business featuring hats for all seasons.Photo: Nevertex<p><p>In secondary school, Putkonen was enthralled to realise how quickly and easily he could fashion woollen handicrafts. He earned a fair amount of pocket money by making hats to sell to his friends.<p><p>After leaving school in 1998, he set up his own company and pipo brand, called Kooma (the Finnish word for “coma”). This name came from the slang expression vetää koomat (literally “put on a coma”) used by young guys to mean “party like crazy.”<p><p>As skateboarding and hip-hop culture took off in Finland, his warm but supercool hats sold like hotcakes. In the early 2000s Putkonen and some friends started a business in Oulu called Real Deal, selling skateboarding gear and Kooma woollies.<p><p>At about the same time as his three kids started arriving on the scene, Putkonen was shuttling back and forth to Rovaniemi, more than 200 kilometres (125 miles) away, to study textile design at the University of Lapland. “For a while I was pretty close to burnout,” he says, “though I didn’t realise it at the time.”<p><p>It became clear that he had to take a break, so he put his pipo production on hold, leaving everything in the cellar of the family home, while he focused on raising his offspring. “It felt positive to just give in and do things the way it suited the kids,” he says.<p><p>PaaPii Design, based in the Ostrobothnia region, produces family-oriented garments including hats such as this one, entitled “Harvest.”Photo: PaaPii Design<p><p>Demand for Putkonen’s pipos never died down. With pipos coming into fashion, even Finns who had only ever worn woollens to protect themselves from the cold could now look trendy in their old woolly hats.<p><p>Finnish winter temperatures can sink as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit). In the summer it can get very warm, though the country doesn’t experience the same kind of heatwaves as more southerly parts of Europe. This means you can wear thinner knitted hats even in the summer.<p><p>A few years ago it was trendy for pipos to have protective “wind stopper” lining. But today woollen designs that let the air through are also popular. One designer who has had the opportunity to keep an eye on hat trends is Terttu Harsunen at Finnish knitwear company Nevertex in the the central-western region of Ostrobothnia. “Merino wool is also ‘in’ now,” she says. “It’s soft but not itchy.”<p><p>Nevertex makes hats for customers of all ages; Harsunen reckons that the earlier craze for pipos among young men continues to show itself in the wardrobes of middle-aged guys today. “And there’s a new trend of older gentlemen who want black or grey pipos to wear with classic outfits,” she says.<p><p>Anniina Isokangas (whose last name coincidentally means “big fabric”) is CEO and designer at another company in Ostrobothnia, PaaPii Design. Looking at the opposite end of the age spectrum, she notices how children – and their parents – also follow and shape the direction of hat fashion. For families with young children, wearing a set of matching hats can give everyone a sense of shared identity and togetherness. “It’s a kind of twinning trend for the whole family,” says Isokangas. She also notes that a pipo can cover up a “bad-hair day” for a parent pressed for time.<p><p>“The ‘pipo’ in itself is timeless,” says Antti Putkonen of Kooma when asked about his company’s longevity.Photo: Susanna Ekfors<p><p>For ten years Kooma kept a low profile. But eventually Antti Putkonen’s kids grew up a bit, giving dad more time to himself. Now he’s making and marketing his pipos as a full-time entrepreneur again, in his brick-and-mortar premises and on the internet.<p><p>He’s got a lot of colleagues and competitors in Finland in addition to Nevertex and PaaPii. Although they won’t all fit into one article, we’ll also mention Costo, which offers “environmentally sustainable and good-looking designs;” Vai-kø, which makes 100-percent merino wool hats for “tough hikes or Sunday strolls” and says it gives 5 percent of its sales income to charity; and SuperYellow, which aims to “create a headwear culture” that is “colourful,” “innovative” and “functional.”<p><p>There are many hats vying for consumers’ attention, but the basic demand for pipos hasn’t changed at all, though different models may fall in and out of favour. The most popular knitted pipos today are taller designs that flop down slightly behind your head.<p><p>“But the pipo in itself is timeless, and I can quickly react to changing fashions,” says Putkonen. He aims to strengthen and grow Kooma until what is now a one-person business must hire more people.<p><p>By Susanna Ekfors, November 2016<p><p>Inspiration at school<p><p>Wearing hats makes sense<p><p>Kooma comeback<p>", "time": "2016-11-18T08:16:24+00:00", "type": "business"}

Finland is a global forerunner in the piloting of such services.<p><p>The concept of a smart city involves using existing and innovative technologies to make life easier for everyone. We can especially get smarter when it comes to getting around town. A pioneering programme run by Finland’s Ministry of Transport and Communications and Tekes aims to realise the concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS).<p><p>“The idea is that a single smartphone app will look after all your mobility needs, finding the best way to get where you want to go using any combination of transport modes – and letting you pay for all your mobility needs conveniently through a single system,” explains Sonja Heikkilä who coordinated Tekes’s MaaS programme in 2015, and now works at OP Financial Group, leading a project developing new mobility services.<p><p>According to Heikkilä, it is already feasible to expand the journey planning services run in many large cities to encompass options like taxi services, shared car rides or even free city bikes, as well as public bus and rail services.<p><p>These bundled options will be provided by “mobility integrators”. Working in a whole new business area, these competitive service-providers will run hi-tech systems that display information on timetables, real-time vehicle locations and journey fares on user-friendly interfaces, while enabling you to instantly book all parts of your trip.<p><p>“Depending on your agreement with your chosen mobility integrator, you might pay-as-you-go for whatever mode of transport you use, pay in advance for a fixed time period package, or pay afterwards just like the way we pay our telecom bills,” adds Heikkilä.<p><p>Such schemes depend on transport operators giving mobility integrators access to their information and payment systems. The Finnish Taxi-Owners’ Federation and national rail company VR are already open to the idea.<p><p>“As a small and agile market Finland is an excellent test-bed for such solutions. Finns tend to be open to new technologies, while we also have plenty of people with expertise in smart mobile communications, as well as government agencies keen to support such initiatives,” says Heikkilä.<p><p>Heikkilä’s vision of future integrated mobility services in Helsinki, as set out in her Master’s thesis for Aalto University, has attracted international interest. Foreign Policy magazine listed her among their 100 Leading Global Thinkers in 2014.<p><p>After developing apps and services through the MaaS Programme during 2015, budding Finnish mobility integrators including MaaS.fi, Tuup, Tziip and TeliaSonera aim to expand their pilot schemes with real users during 2016. Interested cities include Helsinki, Tampere, Seinäjoki, Hämeenlinna and Turku, while the ski resort of Ylläs in Finnish Lapland is planning a unique scheme to help tech-savvy visitors get to, from and around the resort.<p><p>“There’s been a lot of international interest in how we’re pioneering the MaaS concept in Finland,” says Sonja Heikkilä.Photo: Ari Heinonen<p><p>“Though it takes time to change attitudes and behaviour, such systems could become large-scale within a couple of years,” says Heikkilä. “There’s been a lot of international interest in how we’re pioneering the MaaS concept in Finland. We believe such schemes can be scaled up and replicated through international cooperation to enable travellers to use similar interoperable services anywhere in the world through ‘roaming’ mobility services like those we already use for telecoms.”<p><p>Airlines and shipping companies can be integrated, while in some localities vehicles delivering goods or the post could also carry passengers attracted through mobility integrators.<p><p>Heikkilä believes the time is ripe for such schemes, since attitudes towards mobility among the smartphone generation are changing fast. “Young people in cities no longer feel it’s so important to have their own car,” she says. “Instead they appreciate the flexibility of switching between private and public transport modes, as well as the economies of crowdsourcing solutions such as sharing a car or a ride.”<p><p>Though such multimodal mobility trends may mainly be driven by demands for convenience, they will also mean cleaner air and more space for pedestrians and cyclists on city streets.<p><p> <p><p>By 2020, The Metropolitan Area aims to be the world’s leading test-bed and reference area for Smart &amp; Clean solutions.

In those days, Nokia was the jewel in the crown that all Finns were proud of.<p><p>But the new decade saw a structural change brought about by the maturisation of the telecom industry, new players, a new global model and changing market shares. In 2009, Nokia started to downsize its mobile operations, making more and more people redundant. Confronted with plummeting sales figures, Nokia eventually decided to sell its mobile phone business to Microsoft in 2013. This caused a radical contraction in the large Nokia ecosystem.<p><p>Further bad news followed in summer 2015, when Microsoft announced it was scaling down its mobile business and laying off roughly 2,300 employees in Finland. The R&amp;D site in Salo was to be closed down and major redundancies were expected elsewhere in Finland.<p><p>End of the story? A discouraging final blow for Finnish ICT? No, Finns do not give up that easily. This is where a new story, a new vision, of determined recovery begins.<p><p>Extensive and rapid change is painful, but also a strong driver for renewal. Major mobile players have exited the stage, but today’s Finnish ICT arena is alive with new energy and an ambitious can-do attitude.<p><p>Telecoms, radio technology and mobile technology remain strong, the ICT subcontracting industry is competent and lean and the Finnish gaming industry has been booming. Hundreds of new technology startups have created a vibrant startup scene. And new players such as Intel, Huawei, LG and Zalando have set up R&amp;D units in Finland to utilize the available talent pool and to tap into the local tech community. In a recent study for innovative capital cities, Helsinki is listed as one of the top five tech cities in the world.<p><p>In 2015, the leading start-up conference Slush brought 1,700 startups, 800 venture capital investors and 630 journalists to Helsinki.

Winner of the iF Design Award 2015, Creoir specializes in designing user interfaces for consumer brands, most notably designing the Marshall London smartphone and the Ibis smartwatch. Most of Creoir’s employees have a Nokia background. Pekka Väyrynen, CEO of Creoir, is convinced that the way Finns work makes a real difference.<p><p>“Before joining Creoir at the end of 2012, I headed the product development of Nokia’s N9 Meego phones in Oulu. During my business trips across the world I got to see various working cultures, and realized how naturally it comes to Finnish employees to show initiative and always walk the extra mile,” Väyrynen says.<p><p>“You may be able to outsource work overseas at a lower price, but Finnish workers are extremely flexible. If quality and adhering to schedules are important to you, choose Finland,” he urges.<p><p>Part of the Nokia and Microsoft legacy are the professional networks born during those years.<p><p>“Looking back, the thing I appreciate most is the professional competence we accumulated while working for Nokia. Old networks are crucial to the current success of our company. They enable us to scale up our production. And they allow potential cooperation partners to learn about us,” Väyrynen says.<p><p>Another valuable legacy is the ability to use English as a working language.<p><p>“Finns speak English really well. We are used to working in an international multi-site environment and we have existing contacts around the world.

{"title": "Northern Finnish microbrewers build on tradition - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/northern-finnish-microbrewers-build-tradition/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In the Finnish north country, two distilleries and four microbreweries are either already chugging away or about to open. Up here the alcohol business doesn’t mean just brewing or distilling, but also connecting with the local heritage.<p><p>The newest company in the field, Sangen, calls itself an alcohol laboratory. It garnered lots of media attention by gaining over one million euros in a share issue in the spring of 2016. The company was aiming to raise enough to manufacture 200,000 litres of beer per year, but the money it received can cover a capacity of ten times that amount.<p><p>Sangen is brewing and distilling in Tornio, a town on the Finnish-Swedish border, in a brewery space that used to produce Lapin Kulta beer (the name means “Lapland gold”). Formerly owned by the beverage company Hartwall, the location shut down when a merger with Heineken took effect in 2010, halting more than 130 years of brewing tradition in the area. Lapin Kulta is now produced in southern Finland. The Tornio brewery’s resurrection has been hailed as good news in Tornio and the whole of Finnish Lapland.<p><p>“Locality is very important for us,” says Jami Teirikari, Sangen’s head of marketing. The company has consulted with Finland’s Sámi Parliament about possibly using the colours of the Sámi flag in packaging. The indigenous Sámi people’s homeland stretches across northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, and a corner of Russia.<p><p>Sonnisaari cofounder Timo Kanniainen carries a 25-kilogram (55-pound) sack of malt across the brewery floor to add to the vat.Photo: Timo Heikkala/ Lehtikuva<p><p>The local connection is also vital to two new breweries in Oulu, a city of 200,000 people about 130 kilometres (80 miles) down the coast from Tornio. One of them, Sonnisaari, has declared itself the heir of Oulu beer culture. “We are on a mission to make Oulu a brewing city again,” says founder Timo Tyynismaa.<p><p>Beer has been brewed in Oulu since 1847, but later northern Finland almost dried up. For a while Polarpanimot (Polar Breweries) was the only one left, located first in Kiiminki, near Oulu, and later 450 kilometres (280 miles) farther north in Saariselkä, a town best known as a ski resort in Finnish Lapland.<p><p>Sonnisaari got its start in 2011, when its founders began wondering why there was no brewery in a city the size of Oulu. The company, whose name means “bull island,” after a place in Oulu, was founded in 2014. Its first beer hit the market in spring 2015. The other Oulu-based brewery, Maistila, grew out of a love of beer, says owner Riku Harju, one of the founders. Its name references the Finnish word maistaa, “to taste.”<p><p>A passion for brewing and working locally has proven successful for both companies; they are now working to expand their businesses. Sonnisaari even had to triple its expansion plans.<p><p>Another brewery, Lapin Panimo (Lapland Brewery), opens its doors in autumn 2016 in Rovaniemi, 200 kilometres (125 miles) north of Oulu. Rovaniemi city centre is located just south of the Arctic Circle – the last time there was a brewery that close to the Arctic Circle was in 1958. Still another brewery is getting established in Taivalkoski, 180 kilometres (110 miles) east of Oulu.<p><p>Sonnisaari and Maistila welcome the competition. “I don’t think the competition is insane at the moment,” says Harju. “On the contrary, the Finnish microbrewery scene is very open. People help each other out. It’s a great community.”<p><p>Ilpo Sulkala, CEO of Shaman Spirits, knows from experience that a market exists for Finnish “boutique booze.” Photo: Jonna Pulkkinen<p><p>Shaman Spirits, operating in Tyrnävä, not far south of Oulu, stands out as a pioneer of the northern distilling business in the new millennium. It was founded in 1998, a few years after Finland joined the EU, thereby adopting more liberal regulations for manufacturing alcohol. The company started as an initiative on the part of local potato farmers who wanted their surplus production put to good use. This was also a nod to local heritage, since distilling potato booze was by no means a new invention in Tyrnävä; it was common as far back as the 19th century.<p><p>The product line at Shaman Spirits includes various flavours in addition to the traditional vodkas and potato “moonshine.” At the moment over 90 percent of the company’s production is exported. “That is because of the Finnish alcohol monopoly,” says CEO Ilpo Sulkala. Only one, state-owned chain of stores sells hard liquor, and artisanal producers are far from satisfied with the shelf space they receive there.<p><p>Shaman Spirits’ concept lies in the manufacture of “boutique booze,” as Sulkala puts it. “We have no interest in manufacturing alcohol products in bulk,” he says. “Our market is the international vodka market, where our goal is to create new trends, not to follow them.”<p><p>The Tornio River with Finland at left and Sweden on the opposite shore: Sangen is looking into the possibility of reviving an old tradition by using water from the Tornio in its brewery and distillery.Photo: Reima Flyktman/ Lehtikuva<p><p>Although acting locally, other northern breweries and distilleries also have their sights set abroad. Shaman Spirits, in business for almost 20 years, naturally has a head start. Their products are known all over the world, from Hollywood to Moscow, and now the company is aiming to make progress in Asia. “We succeed because our ingredients are pure,” says Sulkala.<p><p>Sonnisaari’s Timo Tyynismaa says that their competition isn’t Finnish. “Our competitors are all the beers in the world,” he says. The demand for northern products is obvious: Sangen’s products haven’t even appeared in local stores yet, but it has already made its first sales on the Continent. “We also invest in purity,” says Jami Teirikari of Sangen. “In our Tornio factory, we are currently studying the possibility of using water from the Tornio River again. Its origins are in the mountains and the mountain brooks.”<p><p>This idea can also be connected to a local tradition. “The freshness of mountain streams” is a well-known advertising slogan for Lapin Kulta, the beer that used to be brewed in Tornio.<p><p>By Jonna Pulkkinen, September 2016<p><p>Expanding tastes in Oulu<p><p>Beverages for boutiques<p><p>Purity sells<p>", "time": "2016-09-15T11:16:14+00:00", "type": "business"}

Unless you are already familiar with the model, it will probably be some time before you navigate your way through the control panel and figure it out.<p><p>“With the increasing use of electronic solutions we see a lot of the old-fashioned usability is lost,” says Heikki Salo of ED Design, a company based in the coastal city of Turku on the southwestern tip of Finland. “Old cars had a tiny switch close to the odometer which was available instantly. Now it takes minutes to find out how to set the trip odometer.”<p><p>New technologies bring many advantages, but often they are neither aesthetically pleasing nor easy to use. But some Finnish companies hope to change that. Finland has a long history in both technology and design, and innovative firms are finding a happy union between the two.

To benefit them all, Link Design had to integrate the technology into the design, from high-efficiency ovens to automatic doors.<p><p>Anundi finds train projects inspiring. “Restaurant cars are important because travel times are long and people like them a lot,” she says. “They are kind of like a living room.”<p><p>Link has participated in a number of other jobs that integrate good design into technology, such as home automation, captains’ bridges on ships and smart ventilation systems.<p><p>“Our strong expertise in product design, product development and the integration of different fields of knowledge is the important foundation,” says Anundi. “One of the benefits of being based in Finland is that you can find both design and technical excellence here.

Traditionally treatment for depression has included medication and therapy; a Finnish company has developed another method.<p><p>“Depression is globally a significant and poorly treated problem,” says Tuomas Neuvonen, CEO of Sooma. “We are very happy to be able to offer new solutions to people who need them.”<p><p>Sooma develops medical devices for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The technology is a noninvasive method which uses very weak electrical currents to stimulate the brain.<p><p>“The device is portable and easy to use,” Neuvonen continues. “With the help of a cap and a pair of electrodes, the device passes a minimal current through the scalp and stimulates determinate brain regions. As a result of repeated stimulation sessions the patient experiences a reduction in the symptoms of depression.”<p><p>Typically the patient receives 15 to 20 daily sessions during a course of therapy.

Their device has one other benefit too, which is particularly important: it is the lowest-cost camera of its kind.<p><p>“There is a huge, unmet need in the market,” says Kopsala. “Every year millions of people go blind. Ninety percent of this blindness is in developing countries, and 80 percent could be avoided. One of the leading and fastest-growing causes for blindness is diabetic retinopathy.

The history of the Finnish technology giant dates back to Mid 19th century.<p><p>Nokia is the name of a weasel, river, town and Finland’s most famous company. Today the name is indelibly connected with mobile phones, but Nokia has a long and diverse history filled with innovation.<p><p>Many of Finland’s largest companies began in the forestry business, and Nokia is no exception. The roots of the company date back to 1865 when Fredrik Idestam established a wood pulp mill close to the town of Tampere.<p><p>The Early days of Nokia are mostly known for their rubber boots, which were added to the company’s selection in 1898 when Nokia was bought by Eduard Polon, who also owned Finnish Rubber Works. After a while he added a third company, the Finnish Cable Works, to Nokia.Photo: Nokia<p><p>In 1898 the forestry company Nokia was purchased by Eduard Polon, who also owned the Finnish Rubber Works. To these two companies Polon soon added a third: the Finnish Cable Works. Polon made good use of the Nokia brand name, which told Finns that they were buying Finnish products and not imported Russian ones.<p><p>The three companies may have had a common ownership, but they were not formally merged until 1967. By this time Nokia produced much more than industrial cables, rubber and wood pulp. In particular, CEO Björn Westerlund invested in electronics and telecommunications. He even encouraged researchers to work on their own projects, something very similar to Google’s famous policy of today.<p><p>Nokia was involved in communications beginning in the 1960s. This evolved into radio and military communications, telephone networks and finally mobile phones by the 1980s.<p><p>Nokia was already involved in communications from the 1960’s, and mobile phones were first added to the product line up in the 1980’s. In 1987 Nokia launched the world’s first hand held NMT-device, Mobira Cityman. A few years before Nokia had launched the world’s first portable car phone, Mobira Talkman.Photo: Nokia<p><p>During the 1980s Nokia expanded greatly throughout Europe, primarily through acquisitions. Yet the conglomerate model ran into problems and they sold other divisions such as forestry, televisions and computers. The rubber business was spun off into Nokian Tyres, which is still a thriving Finnish company today.<p><p>Jorma Ollila became CEO in 1992 and decided to focus solely on telecommunications. Nokia was a key developer of the GSM mobile standard, which was adopted widely throughout the world. This specialism in a new digital standard helped Nokia overtake the dying analogue market, and Nokia passed Motorola to become the largest mobile phone maker in the world in 1998.<p><p>Jorma Ollila was the key person in taking Nokia to next level, telecommunications. During Ollila’s era Nokia became the largest mobile phone maker in the world.Photo: MFA<p><p>Nokia couldn’t have done it without Finland. The country doubled public R&amp;D spending, which benefited many companies. Nokia also worked closely with Finnish universities, not only in research but also with educators to develop needed skills in students. In fact, during some years Nokia hired practically every Finnish engineering graduate. Finally, Finland liberalised regulations and encouraged international competition.<p><p> <p><p>The legendary Nokia 3310 is noted for its great games, including Snake and Space Impact. It sold almost 130 million units. ‘The unbreakable’ was honoured with FINemoji when thisisFINLAND released set of Finland emojis.Photo: Nokia and ThisisFINLAND<p><p>At its height, Nokia contributed 23% of all corporate taxes in Finland and 20% of all exports. They were directly responsible for over 2% of all jobs and were indirectly responsible for quite a bit more. In 2000 Nokia even became – albeit briefly – the most valuable company in Europe.<p><p>The word “Nokia” became a synonym for “mobile phone” in many places around the world. Finland, through Nokia, developed a reputation for high technology and high quality. Even today the popular Nokia 3310 model is jokingly called indestructible.<p><p>Nokia controlled about 40% of the mobile phone market in 2007 when Apple entered the fray. Nokia couldn’t compete against the iPhone experience and worse problems came from Google and Android. An attempt to switch to the Windows operating system made matters worse, not better, and in 2014 Nokia sold off their mobile device business to Microsoft.<p><p>New CEO Rajeev Suri now focused on network telecommunications, and the purchase of Alcatel-Lucent made Nokia the second largest company in the industry.

Photo: Lassila &amp; Tikanoja<p><p>“Building a circular economy will involve much more than recycling wastes. It will mean radical changes ranging from the choice of raw materials, through product design and new service concepts, to the wider use of sidestreams from industry as raw materials for other businesses,” explains Mari Pantsar, Ecological Sustainability Director at the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra.<p><p>“Finland’s pulp and paper industry is a prime example of a major industry where almost all the materials and sidestreams generated during wood processing are already utilised in many kinds of products or to generate renewable energy,” says Pantsar. Finnish firms are rapidly finding new applications for innovative biomaterials derived from wood – enabling the enhanced utilisation of biomass from Finland’s sustainably managed forests, where much more timber grows than is harvested each year.<p><p>Improved raw material use typically comes hand in hand with energy savings. As a country with a cold climate and no fossil fuel reserves of its own, Finland has long recognised the need to maximise energy efficiency in industry and buildings. Such exportable expertise is now more important than ever considering the need to reduce emissions and mitigate global warming.<p><p>In addition to building up a sustainable carbon-neutral bioeconomy by making better use of forest biomass, Finland is actively bringing the concept of the circular economy into other key areas.<p><p>Pantsar explains how machinery and electronic equipment should increasingly be designed to enable them or their different materials and components to be recovered for reuse. “The Finnish forestry machine manufacturers Ponsse have pioneered the concept of product modularity by integrating multi-purpose parts in machines that they can easily take back for maintenance and reuse – also through their international sales network,” she adds.<p><p>Households can also help to eliminate waste and recirculate goods and materials through the economy by increasingly opting for leasing services, sharing schemes and second hand goods. In conventional recycling Finnish families have long led the way when it comes to drinks containers and paper. Improvements in collection, sorting and processing will next focus on other reusable materials including plastics, metals and textiles.<p><p>Improvements in collection, sorting and processing will next focus on other reusable materials including plastics, metals and textiles.

The Finnish energy company St1 is pioneering the production of biofuel from food industry residuals.<p><p>Down on the farm, Pantsar explains that recycling the nutrients needed for growing crops is another crucial goal for Finland – not least because surplus nutrients in runoff from farmland worsen ecological problems in the Baltic Sea. “Instead of using imported chemical fertilisers, farmers are being encouraged to apply recycled organic wastes on their fields, or include nutrient-binding crops in cultivation cycles,” she says.<p><p>Sitra’s experts are helping to create an ambitious road map aiming to get goods and materials circulating smoothly throughout the Finnish economy. They have identified potential savings amounting to billions of euros a year in key sectors.<p><p>“Our plans emphasise close cooperation between industry, researchers, government agencies, legislators and local authorities,” says Pantsar. “Through R&amp;D work new business models and modular product designs can be created that take into account the need for easy maintenance, multiple reuse and recycling right from the start.”<p><p>By Fran Weaver, February 2016<p><p><p><p>Worn-out clothes can now be turned into new fashions, thanks to an innovative process devised by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Ethica as part of the Finnish Circular Economy of Textiles project.<p><p>In the first step of this groundbreaking recycling demonstration scheme, the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Reuse Centre separates cotton clothes that contain reusable fibres, even though their fabric may be too worn out for them to be resold second hand.<p><p>Cotton fabric crushed by recycling specialists Suez is then dissolved in alkali to form a cellulose solution.

His appointment is seen as a sign of the global reputation of Finnish meteorological excellence. FMI forms one of the world’s oldest and most professionally respected national meteorological offices.<p><p>“About half of FMI’s staff of 720 work in R&amp;D, but we also produce a wide range of practical forecasting and warning services for our clients, especially in the transport sector,” says Taalas. He served as FMI’s director general for 11 years and will spend a total of four to eight years leading the Geneva-based WMO.<p><p>Taalas lists FMI’s specialities, including snow and ice monitoring, assisting icebreakers and other ships on the frozen Baltic Sea each winter, and providing services to support Finland’s effective winter road maintenance.<p><p>“We’re proud to have built up strong expertise in many areas. Among meteorological institutes we are number two in the world in terms of published scientific articles.”<p><p>Taalas hopes to help the WMO reproduce Finland’s achievements around the world by transferring advanced expertise to help other meteorological agencies provide high-tech, customer-oriented services, especially in developing countries. The FMI itself currently works in more than 50 countries around the world. In Nepal, Finnish experts are leading a major World Bank funded project aiming to improve national weather observations and create forecasting and warning services that will benefit everyone from airport managers to Himalayan farmers.<p><p>“Such work is now more urgently needed than ever, due to climate change and the associated increasing risk of extreme weather events,” explains Taalas. “Though climate change won’t mean the end of the world, the indisputable scientific facts show it will give mankind major problems over the coming decades – and for much longer if we don’t act decisively.”<p><p>Taalas is worried that more frequent floods or droughts in regions still dependent on subsistence farming could eventually result in large numbers of climate refugees, while global sea level rises may mean that low-lying regions or even entire island countries will have to be abandoned.<p><p>As a meteorologist with a global remit, Taalas emphasises the need to effectively communicate scientists’ concerns to decision-makers. This means complementing the climate assessments and scenarios produced by the WMO-appointed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with evaluations of the massive economic costs of unmitigated global warming.<p><p>“Though climate change won’t mean the end of the world, the indisputable scientific facts show it will give mankind major problems over the coming decades – and for much longer if we don’t act decisively,” says Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organisation.Photo: Tommi Tuomi / Otavamedia<p><p>“At FMI we have our own economists focusing on the economic impacts of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, as well as on the economic benefits of our own work to society,” says Taalas. “We’ve found that national investments in meteorological services can produce five-to-ten-fold economic benefits, due to savings resulting from better weather information and early warning systems.”<p><p>Global efforts to mitigate climate change must include a major switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as well as energy-saving measures. Another hot topic for FMI is to provide new services to help optimise the use of wind power, solar energy and hydropower.<p><p>Some of the most dramatic impacts of climate change are already being felt in the Arctic region, where warming is gradually opening previously frozen sea routes. Shipping is expected to intensify in Arctic waters, and Finnish experts have plenty to offer when it comes to producing services to boost navigational safety in icy seas.<p><p>The intensification of global efforts to combat climate change brings opportunities for businesses producing technologies and services that can help their clients mitigate climate change or adapt to its consequences.<p><p>Finland’s Climate Leadership Council brings together many leading Finnish businesses and research organisations keen to respond to the threat of climate change. According to a study recently conducted by the Confederation of Finnish Industries, as many as 3,000 businesses in Finland see climate change mitigation as a business opportunity.<p><p>“Finland’s strengths in relation to mitigating climate change include many technologies that improve energy efficiency, as well as expertise on the sustainable use of forests and the generation of energy from renewable forest-biomass,” says Taalas.<p><p>In spite of the clear risk of catastrophic climate change Taalas sees room for optimism, as long as the international community finds the political will to act concertedly. In the 1990s his own PhD studies focused on the depletion of the ozone layer – a global threat that is now thankfully under control. “In combatting acid rain and ozone depletion we already have two success stories where the world has responded to urgent problems in our atmosphere pointed out by scientists.”<p><p> <p><p>The Finnish Meteorological Institute’s work on climate change involves the detailed monitoring of the increasing atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases that are causing global climate change, including carbon dioxide and methane.<p><p> “In addition to our measurement stations around Finland we also collect data from FMI stations located in Antarctica, Siberia, South Africa and the Indian Himalayas,” says Petteri Taalas.<p><p>The FMI’s state-of-the-art stations at Pallas and Sodankylä in Finnish Lapland also form a crucial link in a worldwide network of atmospheric measurement stations contributing data to the World Meteorological Organisation’s Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme. Taalas emphasises the importance of the programme as a global watchdog constantly surveying the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.<p><p>“We also collect data from Antarctica, Siberia, South Africa and the Indian Himalayas,” says Petteri Taalas.Photo: Tero Pajukallio/Diaidea<p><p>“But to find ways to mitigate climate change effectively it’s not enough just to measure the amounts of greenhouse gases in the air, since we also need to understand the whole carbon cycle – and exactly what happens to additional carbon emissions,” explains Taalas. This means measuring fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere and carbon sinks such as the sea and forests.<p><p>The FMI’s marine and atmospheric research station on Utö, a remote island in the Gulf of Finland, uses ultramodern devices to collect real-time physical, chemical and biological data above and beneath the waves. Utö is one of four Finnish atmospheric stations that form a key part of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), a Europe-wide research network focusing on greenhouse gas balances and carbon cycles. The ICOS network, consisting of 50 stations in 15 countries, is run from FMI’s Helsinki headquarters, reflecting Finland’s keen interest in contributing to international action on climate issues.<p><p>Photo: Vaisala<p><p>Accurate real-time meteorological data is today more urgently needed than ever, especially in cities and regions vulnerable to extreme weather events.

Scientists and academics often work in bubbles, cut off from the rest of the world. But here the teams meet and work with each other.

The music sounds clear and cosy, emanating from two small speakers wrapped in yellow “speakerwear” made of recycled material. A few blocks away, old rocksteady reggae thrums off the walls of Street Gastro, again coming from discreet, sweater-clad speakers.<p><p>Both establishments are using speakers designed and produced here in the Punavuori neighbourhood since 2013 by Uploud Audio, one of Helsinki’s new boutique speaker manufacturers.<p><p>Uploud Audio and another company, Unmonday, have grown up in the shadow of eastern Finnish firms such as Genelec and Amphion, which have earned international prizes and rave reviews since before the turn of the century, primarily among audiophiles and pros.

It’s the unobtrusive white square on the wall (top middle).Photo: Anni Pitkäjärvi/Uploud Audio<p><p>But why are there so many speaker companies blossoming in Finland now?<p><p>“The short answer: long winters and lots of inventors who love tinkering,” says Lassi Laitinen, a social psychologist who cofounded Uploud Audio. “Genelec has made world-class loudspeakers for studio monitoring for decades, Gradient has won numerous awards at hi-fi fairs all over the world, and Amphion and Aurelia have also done a great job of making more accessible speakers for the larger public. Then there are companies like us, who are making speakers for the rest of us.”<p><p>Today’s younger buyers have grown up listening to music on the go, through earbuds, laptops or phone speakers. That music has often been in the thin, highly-compressed MP3 format, or increasingly streamed over the internet at modest fidelity levels that cause old-school audiophiles to scoff. Yet younger consumers are now demanding higher-quality sound, along with more offbeat looks and greater convenience.<p><p>“One of the biggest trends at the recent Consumer Electronics Show was the youngsters’ growing interest in something better,” says Amphion CEO Anssi Hyvönen. “Naturally this must be presented in a fashion that is familiar to them, such as high-quality desktop systems, headphones and so on.”<p><p>Timeless and increasingly wireless<p><p>Unmonday’s Jukka Illi takes in the soundscape on New York’s Times Square.Photo: Unmonday<p><p>It may also take an unfamiliar form, such as Unmonday’s cone-shaped, leather-cased ceramic speakers. Founded by three designers, the company sold its first speakers in January 2014. Like Uploud Audio’s speakers, they look somewhat retro – or timeless – with a strong emphasis on handicraft and ecology. Unlike their neighbourhood rivals, though, Unmonday also focuses on portability and wireless simplicity.<p><p>“You can enjoy quality audio wherever you go and then place it as part of a bigger system when you return home,” notes Jukka Illi, Unmonday’s business director. “Wireless solutions have gained enough credibility to become a serious option for even the most demanding hi-fi enthusiasts. And once you listen to a really nice sound system, there’s no going back.”<p><p>Wireless audio is hot, projected to grow into a 25-billion-dollar industry by 2020.<p><p>“Multiroom wireless systems such as Sonos and streaming services such as Spotify and Tidal are liberating people to enjoy music anywhere,” says Laitinen. “Making the sound work in real environments, in real people’s homes, with the kind of placements and aesthetics they find appealing, is the thing.”<p><p>Sonically uncompromising<p><p>The rounded corners of Genelec’s speakers have formed their visual hallmark since Harri Koskinen designed them in the late 1990s.Photo: Genelec<p><p>The granddaddy of Finnish speaker manufacturers is Genelec, established in 1978. In the late ’90s, they teamed up with the now-famous Harri Koskinen, an up-and-coming designer at the time, who rounded the corners of their old box speakers for a look that has remained basically unchanged ever since.<p><p>“We do emphasise industrial design or visual design, but never at the cost of audio quality,” says Lars-Olof Janflod, Genelec’s director of marketing and PR. “In our designs, function comes first and the form is there to support the function.”<p><p>Amphion’s Hyvönen echoes his words: “We will never make any sonic compromises to make the product look more attractive. But especially on the home side, where speakers are placed very visibly in the living room, aesthetics also matter a great deal.” The company offers a range of speakers priced from 275 to 16,000 euros – the high end includes favourites of top US producers such as Rick Rubin and Bruce Swedien, not to mention mixing engineer Manny Marroquin.<p><p>“The highest level of speaker-building is a funny crossbreed of engineering, humanity and black magic,” says Hyvönen. “The interesting thing is that these Finnish companies, despite having very different approaches, are getting recognition in both home and pro fields.”<p><p> <p><p> <p><p>By Wif Stenger, August 2015<p><p>Long winters and lots of inventors<p>", "time": "2015-08-05T07:39:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "Finland reaches for the solar switch - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/finland-reaches-for-the-solar-switch/", "review": "", "content": "<p>A project aimed at changing attitudes about solar power – as well as its financing and legislation – involves Aalto University, the city of Helsinki and more than 40 Finnish companies and other partners.<p><p>A few panels installed on summer cottages to catch the midnight sun – that used to be the extent of Finnish solar power. Otherwise it has not traditionally been taken very seriously in Finland. Too expensive, with too short a season, said the sceptics.<p><p>Now the picture is changing dramatically. The price of solar panels has plunged by 80 percent since 2008, while their efficiency has risen. New panels work even on dim, rainy days. Germany and Denmark have proved that solar – in tandem with wind – can be a major player, even in northern Europe. In 2014 Germany generated more than 6 percent of its electricity from solar.<p><p>Finland has several aces up its sleeve: solar panels produce more efficiently at cool temperatures and in clean, dustless surroundings. Meanwhile, cutting-edge solar innovation is under way at dozens of export companies and places such as Aalto University, Lappeenranta University and VTT Technical Centre.<p><p>The FinSolar Project involves some 50 partners, including six cities, top retailer S-Group and Ruukki Construction. The venture, which runs through the end of 2015, is drawing up plans for measures to be taken nationally by the end of the decade. The main aims: expanding jobs, exports and self-sufficiency.<p><p>“Our goal is to give a real push in developing business in this sector,” says the project’s director, professor Raimo Lovio. “We need a coordinated national effort involving all areas of society: companies, authorities, political decision-makers and citizens.”<p><p>The country is committed to the EU goal of 20 percent renewable energy by 2020. Researchers here are busy developing biofuels from forest industry by-products. Wind power is being expanded, though the country is still catching up to its Nordic neighbours in this area.<p><p>As this night photo of a bridge in Oulu shows, the sun doesn’t set in northern Finland for several months during the summer, making it a good spot for solar powerPhoto: Pekka Kallasaari/Visit Oulu<p><p>“In the future Finland will need all kinds of renewable energy, a palette,” says FinSolar’s project leader, Karoliina Auvinen of Aalto University School of Business. “Since 2014, there’s clear proof that solar has hit the price level where it’s profitable in Finland, under certain conditions. It’s feasible here from March to October. It goes hand-in-hand with wind, which produces better in the winter.”<p><p>On a tour of Aalto University’s Energy Garage, Auvinen notes that it’s possible to generate the same amount of solar energy here as in Germany.<p><p>“We get the same amount of sun annually – it’s just concentrated in the summer. And photovoltaic panels are most efficient when they’re cold. So when you get sunny, cold days, you get the best production ever.”<p><p>You might think solar would be less viable up north. Yet the northern coastal city of Oulu has more bright days – and hence better solar yield – than even south-central Finland. Players continue to one-up each other as the field expands, creating a sort of race to put up panels.<p><p>The country’s biggest solar plant, with a capacity of 420 kilowatts, reaching completion in Oulu in June 2015, surpasses the previous number-one installation, switched on in March 2015 by Helsinki’s electric company, Helen. It covers a large roof in the Suvilahti neighbourhood and has a capacity of 340 kilowatts, sufficient to power 137 apartments. It brought the national total to ten megawatts – still modest compared to neighbouring Sweden, which installed more than 36 megawatts last year alone.<p><p>Helen is inviting customers to “sponsor” individual panels – a system that saw great success in Suvilahti – in order to construct another site in the Kivikko district, eclipsing its predecessor with more than twice the capacity.<p><p>FinSolar Project, Finnish solar power, panels, Helen, Helsinki, Oulu, renewable energy, Aalto University, FinlandPhoto: Helen<p><p>FinSolar leaders are lobbying for legislative reform to help Finland catch up. For instance, it is one of the few EU states that do not offer subsidies for private households to invest in solar. And VAT on panels is well above average.<p><p>In winter 2015, then Prime Minister Alexander Stubb received a solar petition with 22,000 signatures; it enumerated demands that included tax breaks for homeowners. Nineteen organisations backed the petition, including the Finnish Environment Institute (known by its Finnish abbreviation, SYKE).<p><p>According to SYKE researcher Hanna-Liisa Kangas, “the price of solar panels has dropped dramatically, so the solar energy market in Finland could be kick-started with very modest costs and policy changes.”<p><p>Signs of change exist. In March 2015, Parliament expanded a tax exemption to encourage businesses and municipalities to install solar plants of up to 900 kilowatts.<p><p>Around 50 Finnish companies have exports in the solar sector, including Valoe, Green Energy Finland, Naps, Nocart and Savosolar. With solar set to become the world’s biggest source of electricity by 2050, Lovio sees a vast potential for exports.<p><p>“Internationally,” he says, “such decentralised energy systems are a quickly growing field where there’s much potential for Finnish know-how.”<p><p>By Wif Stenger, June 2015<p><p>Concentrated summer sun<p><p>Here comes the solar<p>", "time": "2015-07-23T13:25:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

It was a long weekend and the bins say a lot of waste has been generated. They say more than that, too. They report their internal temperatures and even predict when they will be completely full.<p><p>Not all garbage bins are equal. In a quiet retirement community, a can may take a week to fill up, but another in a big block of flats may overflow daily. This is a goldmine of information if you want to run a city’s waste services efficiently, and this is where the Finnish company Enevo is finding its niche.<p><p>“Typically our customers operate on fixed schedule-based routes, which means the haulers visit the same bins on a particular day regardless if the bins need servicing or not,” says Pirkka Palomäki, Enevo’s chief operating officer. “We offer a full solution from sensors to navigation in the trucks. We also learn from history and provide a forecast, kind of like a weather forecast of waste.”<p><p>The company is generating press around the world for their ingenious solution to an old problem. Global investors have also been interested, and Enevo has received funding from Silicon Valley venture capitalists, Finnish Industry Investment and Nokia chairman Risto Siilasmaa.<p><p>Placed inside containers, this type of sensor lets Enevo monitor garbage bins to help plot efficient collection route and schedules.Photo: Eeva Anundi/Enevo<p><p>Enevo’s service is an example of the Internet of Things (IoT), the network of physical objects that are embedded with electronics and connected to the internet. The big IoT evolution lies not only in sensors that collect data or transmitters that send it, but also in how that information is used.<p><p>It’s relatively simple to imagine a trash bin that measures how full it is. But imagine a city with thousands of bins filling up at different rates, dozens of garbage trucks and millions of potential collection routes. Enevo tells its customers the most efficient way to empty the bins.<p><p>“The core of our data analytics is making the most out of savings, meaning fewer trucks on the road, less CO2 emissions and significant savings in the operation,” says Palomäki.<p><p>With a little imagination, you can see their solution being used for all sorts of deliveries and collections, but Palomäki says right now they are focused on waste management. “There are obviously many applications that we can address later on,” he says. “At this stage it is important that we stay focussed and provide the best solution.”<p><p>Thingsee One allows users, wherever they may wander, to invent applications that expand the Internet of ThingsPhoto: Thingsee<p><p>While Enevo concentrates on a single aspect of the IoT, another Finnish company is taking the opposite approach. Based in the northern city of Oulu, Thingsee creates the hardware and mobile application, and how it is used is up to you. The device includes a GPS locator, gyroscope and magnetometer. Sensors register light, pressure, temperature and humidity.<p><p>“I have seen some pretty cool innovations,” says cofounder Ville Ylläsjärvi. “One was an off-road application for a car. To call it ‘interesting’ is too mild a word.”<p><p>With the Thingsee One device, a rally car can send data to its support team about acceleration, speed, location or even its tilt. Other ideas Ylläsjärvi has seen include an alert when the mailman arrives and a tracker for a hobbyist’s balloon.<p><p>The whole project is built upon openness and flexibility, he says. People interested in development can create software on the open-source platform. The device can be used by a technical novice in a hobby project or by professional developers who want to test an idea. Its versatility is not just for curious individuals. One of the largest potential markets is companies building their own IoT offerings.<p><p>“We are contacted daily by companies wanting to build new services,” Ylläsjärvi says. “It’s the world’s first smart developer device.”<p><p> <p><p> <p><p>By David J.

She now heads the game development studio that created Cities in Motion, a mass transit simulation game that allows players to build and manage transportation networks in different cities. Colossal Order’s next release is Cities: Skylines, in which players build their own cities.<p><p>Hallikainen’s team worked on a 100-year timeline for the first version of Cities in Motion in 2009. “We went back to history from 1920 and tried to make accurate settings in the limits of a game,” says Hallikainen. That effort paid off, attracting interest from gaming communities.<p><p>The company created a sequel, Cities in Motion 2, by upgrading technology in 2013, adding new features and integrating smooth navigation mechanisms based largely on feedback from public transportation and simulation enthusiasts’ forums. “I spend time every day on the forums, checking what players have to say,” says Hallikainen, highlighting the importance of consumer engagement.<p><p>Screenshot: Colossal Order In “Cities: Skylines,” players build their own cities.By Asha Gopalkrishnan, December 2014<p><p>Meeting expectations isn’t child’s play, as many creative minds are working simultaneously. “Game designers want the games to be a particular way and programmers have to create it accordingly for the player,” says Hallikainen.<p><p>She wears many hats – marketing, sales, human resources and finance: “I’m really good with money and can make things happen with very small budgets.”<p><p>That’s a key trait for entrepreneurs who are constantly innovating. In the words of Elina Arponen, founder of Tribe Studios, “As an entrepreneur, you have to see the relationships between things and phenomena that you didn’t see before.<p><p>Driven by curiosity to understand how computers can be used to create human bonds, Arponen chose to study computer science and eventually came up with Dramagame – a technology for creating multiplayer learning and entertainment simulation games with social storylines.<p><p>The idea, Arponen says, is to encourage and enable people to interact in various social environments. Using gaming as a platform, she presents a mixed bag of social situations ranging from a fantasy spy tale to real, work-related events. “The subject matter of the game dictates the environment and the characters,” says Arponen.<p><p>Just act natural: Players convene in the Dramagame creation Velvet Sundown.Screenshot: Velvet Sundown<p><p>Her journey so far has had a few inevitable bumps. Arponen explains that while designing the game at first, the biggest problem was dealing with the complexity of multiplayer conversations. “If you have five characters interacting, it easily makes tens of millions of different variations and it’s not humanly possible to cover the whole spectrum,” she says.<p><p>To counteract that, Tribe Studios created a testing tool that ran through the story scripts and possible combinations before games were released. Arponen says that the current hitch lies in dealing with the long sales cycles of consumers in the training industry. But she is undeterred: “You have to get out of your comfort zone.”<p><p>For many women entrepreneurs, that comfort zone lies in stereotypical business ventures.

Here’s what he discovered to help him transform himself from a mild-mannered, monotonous presenter into a more expressive, confident star on the stage.<p><p> “Overall, I learned that it is not just about the content of your presentation,” says Tornberg. “It’s about performance. It’s about posture, facial expressions, enthusiasm and feeling.”<p><p>Dance instructor Merja Satulehto presses Vesa Tornberg’s posture into shape.Photo: Henna Majuri<p><p> Dance instructor Merja Satulehto has been a judge on the Finnish TV series Dance and Dancing with the Stars. She advises Tornberg how to use his body to show excitement for his product and business: “Body language and tone of voice are definitely things to practice,” she says. “Vesa is used to talking business and it shows. His performance feels too serious.” Her advice? “Push your chest out and hold your head high. Show emotion and confidence.”<p><p> Singer, voice teacher and breathing therapist Maija Lauri teaches performing arts at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences. She challenges entrepreneurs like Tornberg to become a rock star in front of their audience. “Proper abdominal breathing will improve the quality of your voice and help relax both the body and mind,” she says. “Don’t speak like a doctor using a dictation machine – monotonously and all in one breath. Leave pauses to give meaning to what you have just said.” She also offers advice on how to raise voice volume: “Focus on the back row of the audience when you are speaking to a crowd.”<p><p> Elina Korhonen is a successful young actor with experience in movies, TV and theatre. Her pitching advice? “To help you relax, you should warm up your body before your presentation. Also, to help bring energy into your presentation, move around the stage a little.”<p><p> Riitta Annala, English teacher and CEO of English language game company Hawina, has advice for people who have difficulty pronouncing some English words. “Don’t get rid of your accent,” she says. “Just find other, easier words that say the same thing. So instead of saying ‘strategy,’ for example, say ‘approach’ or ‘plan.’”<p><p> Juho Risku, cofounder of Finnish venture capitalist firm Butterfly, offers this advice: “Focus less on the abstract and more on the concrete. In other words, don’t use elaborate, fluffy terms like ‘unique product offering.’ Finns tend to use too many abstract words.

Our approach is open, agile and community-based.”<p><p>Matikainen says that New Factory has helped to create dozens of startups and hundreds of jobs and projects so far. Their offering has proven to be important on the national level as Finland undergoes industrial structural change.<p><p><p><p>“I suppose we could be called Startup Sauna veterans,” says Jani Hursti, founder of Asema Electronics. “We were in the first batch of companies in spring 2010. We needed to learn, and this was the place to be.”<p><p>Asema, founded in late 2009, specialises in energy management. It uses consumer terminals for the smart electricity grid, so customers know exactly how much energy they use, when they use it and how much it costs. While the company had a fine idea, they needed help in bringing that idea to market.<p><p>As with almost any new program, Hursti says that there were some hiccups in Startup Sauna in the beginning. But organisers learned from their mistakes, realised what companies needed and modified their approach.<p><p>“It’s never easy, and there’s never a perfect package, but they really gained in professionalism,” Hursti says. “We had access to the things we needed: industry contacts, financiers and the media.”<p><p>When asked about the best outcome of the program, Hursti gives an unexpected answer: cardboard boxes.<p><p>“I’ll explain,” he says, smiling. “We wanted to go to an expo, but we needed to pack our stuff. We needed tools and hardware. Here we were able to get all these things we needed. It provides the infrastructure companies need to operate efficiently.”<p><p>By David J.

If a Finn doesn’t have a 3D printer, he or she can use one for free at Aalto University.<p><p>Kari Voutila thinks that we are in the midst of the next industrial revolution. If he has his way, his company will be at the centre of it.<p><p>“I believe 3D printing is the next step in digitalisation,” says Voutila, CEO of the Kuopio-based 3D Online Factory. “What has happened in the music industry with Spotify, and in television with YouTube and Netflix, is also going to happen with physical things.”<p><p>He says that industry will change from mass production to local, personalised fabrication. Consumers will manufacture their own products with their own 3D printing devices or at printing hubs. People have been predicting this for some time, but 3D Online Factory already has a plan in place. The beginning of their idea is called Launzer.<p><p>“The basic idea is engagement,” continues Voutila. “We see 3D printing as a tool, not a reason to exist. What we offer when we talk about ‘social media of things’ is a platform for interaction between companies and consumers, brands and fans.”<p><p>Building a bust: A statuesque form takes shape in a 3D printer at FabLab.Photo: flickr/AaltoFabLab cc by 2.0<p><p>Building a bust: A statuesque form takes shape in a 3D printer at FabLab.Launzer will be a 3D printable marketplace where consumers interact with each other as well as the brands. A person could print out characters from their favourite games, for instance. Early participants include the gaming company Legendary Games and the entertainment business Eyeworks.<p><p>“For fans, the innovative part will be the social media elements,” Voutila explains. “Fans can share all that they have printed out, follow other users and be part of the design and marketing of their favourite brands. It’s easy and fun. It is a new platform for brands in entertainment, gaming, media and design to do merchandising in a totally different way.”<p><p>For people who would like the idea of 3D printing but don’t know where to start, Aalto University’s Fabrication Laboratory is there to help. Inside FabLab, people can find the equipment, materials and expertise for their own projects.<p><p>“I first came here just as a member of the public,” says Charlie Banthorpe. “I designed my own coffee table and came to have the top fabricated. Now I work here.”<p><p>Banthorpe, who has the vague but intriguing job description “helping you make stuff out of things,” shows off Aalto’s FabLab along with his fellow studio master Ali Neissi.<p><p>FabLab Labradors: Two newly created miniature dogs gaze out at the world.Photo: flickr/AaltoFabLab cc by 2.0<p><p>Banthorpe and Neissi show off elaborate bracelets and sculptures as the 3D printers slowly print out two miniature Labrador dogs. The quality of FabLab’s output is impressive: an observer would probably never know that the signage and much of the furniture was designed and created in-house.<p><p>“The oldest person we’ve had was a 75-year-old who made a bridge prototype,” says Neissi, who specialises in electronics. “The youngest was a baby who came in with his parents. We get entrepreneurs building prototypes; hobbyists; artists; and all sorts of people. Many people don’t want some mass-manufactured item. Instead they want something personalised.”<p><p>Although the equipment is normally reserved for students, anyone can wander into FabLab during its weekly open days. A person can use the machines and get help or advice for free. The only fees are for the materials, and even those costs are minimal.<p><p>FabLab has scanners, cutters, milling machines and a variety of 3D printers. Some of the printers are commercial models, but others are open source machines built by the community. The idea of open source – universal access and open collaboration – is at the heart of the project.<p><p>“This is the philosophy of FabLab,” Banthorpe explains. “It is paying it back and building on what others have done.

Some of them end up staying much longer than they planned.<p><p>When she decided to leave her native Germany to work in Joensuu, forest cartographer Katja Gunia had a clear plan. She would stay one year in Finland, then move on. That was in 2004. A decade later, she’s still there.<p><p>“I discovered the Finnish way of life – close to nature and a nice work atmosphere,” recalls Gunia, the mother of two young children. “It was great! When my employers offered me a new contract, I took it.”<p><p>A nature enthusiast, she especially enjoys the Finns’ relationship to their forests. “They belong together,” she says. “Finns are used to spending time in the forests. They go there for a walk after work or to pick berries. It’s part of their everyday life, but at the same time it’s very special. For me, Joensuu is a haven.”<p><p>From left: Katja Gunia (Germany), Blanca Sanz (Spain), Alain Minguet (Belgium), Jarno Hämäläinen (Finland) and Basanta Raj Gautam (Nepal) enjoy sharing forestry knowledge in Joensuu, eastern Finland.Photo: Pauline Curtet<p><p>With more than 70 percent of its surface covered by forests, Finland is – by far – the most densely forested country in Europe.<p><p>Surrounded by thousands of acres of woods, Joensuu, with its 75,000 inhabitants, is at the centre of the Finnish forest industry. It hosts dozens of companies and research centres whose activities are related to forestry. They employ thousands of people, including many foreigners.<p><p>“In a way, this is the place to be,” says Blanca Sanz, a young Spanish woman who spent a summer in Joensuu doing an internship in forest ecology. “Before arriving, I had heard a lot about how great Finnish forests were. Yet I was very surprised when I got here. The amount of forest was incredible! I had never seen that in Spain.”<p><p>“Surprised” is also the word that Augustine Moses Gbagir, a PhD student from Nigeria, uses to describe his arrival in Finland: “Five years ago I came on a scholarship. When I stepped out of the plane, I thought, Oh my God, it is so cold. And it was only August.” He laughs at the thought.<p><p>Fortunately, Gbagir got used to the snowy winters and enjoys his work in Joensuu: “Finnish forests are very different from the forests I knew. For instance, the species of trees and animals are not the same. It gave me the opportunity to learn a lot of new things, try new technologies and, maybe one day, apply them in my own country.”<p><p>Workers for the Finnish forestry company UPM with baskets of tree seedlings are replanting an area of forest.Photo: UPM<p><p>Nepalese Basanta Raj Gautam, forest sustainability manager, has lived in Joensuu since 2006. He also wants to use his Finnish experience to help fight deforestation in his homeland.<p><p>“Here,” he says, “forests are well managed. It’s more profitable for locals to grow trees than to cut them. That’s a good model and it should be applied in Nepal.”<p><p>Basanta, who has a young son, likes his life and work in Finland, but his plans for the future are not completely clear. “I keep saying that I won’t spend my whole life here. I’d like to go back to Nepal, yet I never do.”<p><p>The foreign forest-lovers in Joensuu also represent a major asset for Finnish companies specialising in forestry. “My company has a lot of international partnerships, in Nepal or in Senegal, for instance,” says Jarno Hämäläinen, a manager at Arbonaut, a Joensuu-based forest management firm.<p><p>“If part of our staff didn’t come from abroad, we wouldn’t be able to innovate.

The event name refers to the fact that the sun hardly sets at all during the northern summer.<p><p>Dorothy Whittick of Canada’s IBM Global Centre of Competence for Healthcare and Life Sciences, a keynote speaker at Nightless Night, believes Finns are leading the world in advanced and innovative health and wellness ecosystems.<p><p>“The culture of Finland is very collaborative and transparent, which helps to unite diverse groups of stakeholders,” she says. “The OuluHealth ecosystem is an excellent example of this collaboration – between academic researchers, business entrepreneurs, government leaders and health and social service providers. This collaboration, transparency and stakeholder engagement allows them to leapfrog other nations in developing innovative and inclusive health and wellness ecosystems.”<p><p>Minna Hendolin of TEKES believes Finland will be “a model country for consolidating a sustainable and innovative healthcare system.”Photo: Tero Suutari/Business Oulu<p><p>The city of Oulu is becoming well known internationally for delivering integrated health and social care while embracing technology, says Brian O’Connor, chair of the European Connected Health Alliance: “More and more governments throughout Europe are moving to the same model and want to learn from Oulu.”<p><p>“Among other healthcare innovations, Oulu has pioneered the Self Care Project, which allows citizens to engage in direct electronic communication with their doctor, access blood test results electronically and book and manage their doctor’s appointments online. The system is currently being used by over half the city’s population.”<p><p>Earlier in 2014, four Finnish government ministers (the Ministers of Economic Affairs; Social Affairs and Health; Education and Science; and Health and Social Services) signed a health sector growth strategy for research and innovation activities that formalised a national roadmap for an innovative healthcare ecosystem. The goal was to create an internationally competitive advantage for Finland.<p><p>Minna Hendolin works at the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, known by its Finnish abbreviation TEKES, as executive director of vitality of people. She says this is the first time Finland has established a national strategy that examines its health sector from an innovation investment and business growth perspective, rather than simply treating it as a necessary cost.<p><p>“This new strategy aims to build up a national health ecosystem of partners in business, research and public bodies that will boost innovation and business growth,” she says. “We are on the verge of becoming a model country for consolidating a sustainable and innovative healthcare system.”<p><p>In the digital health revolution, the focus is shifting from health treatment to prevention and making better choices.Photo: Juha Tuomi/Rodeo/Lehtikuva<p><p>One of the reasons for this success is that Finland has built up reputable biobanks storing human biological samples and associated data. This benefits research aimed at discovering better diagnostic treatment of chronic health conditions and improving prevention of these conditions. Hendolin says the biobanks are establishing close collaboration between government, business and research entities.<p><p>Finland is well positioned to make the best use of this collaboration to help prevent chronic disease, believes Maritta Perala-Heape, director of the Centre for Health and Technology at University of Oulu. “We are experiencing a shift away from health treatment to a focus on prevention,” she says.<p><p>“The digital health revolution is giving us the opportunity to collect and analyse a lot of health data so that we can build new preventative health services and guide citizens towards better health choices. Finland’s extensive health databases are driving this focus on prevention to help citizens lower the risks of chronic diseases.”<p><p>“Our comprehensive national health databases are globally unique,” says Hendolin, “and they’re opening up a real opportunity for Finland to be a forerunner in health sector research, innovation, investment and new business activities.<p><p>“Our biobanks especially are leading the way,” she says. “Finnish legislation recently established biobanks that would collaborate with businesses to improve health outcomes.

It may sound like the stuff of science fiction, yet this technology is available to us today – and much of it has been developed in Finland.<p><p> This incredible technology comes from the bioeconomy. But what is the bioeconomy?<p><p> “It’s a whole socioeconomic system that considers the big picture: industrial processes, jobs and wellbeing,” says professor Anne-Christine Ritschkoff, in charge of strategic research at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. A world-renowned expert in bioeconomy, Ritschkoff says it’s not just about sustainability of the environment, but sustainability of the whole economy. “The very strict definition,” she says, “is an alternative to oil dependency.”<p><p> There’s a lot happening in the scientific and business communities around the world in developing a bioeconomy. Experts agree it is the new wave of the global economy, and it needs plenty of new technology and innovation if it is to succeed. Finland has taken a leading role in this area, not only in research, but also in application.<p><p>A VTT-coordinated project called Algida explores the use of algae in producing biofuel.Photo: VTT<p><p> Finland is important in the development of the bioeconomy because it has both the natural resources and the human resources to make it possible. The bioeconomy is based on biomass, easily renewable plant material and animal waste that can be utilised in manufacturing and industry. The best source of biomass in Finland is the forests that cover 75 percent of the country’s land area. There is also a very highly educated and skilled working population, including the many research scientists and ICT experts that are needed to create new product development processes.<p><p> A growing number of success stories highlight the benefits of the bioeconomy. The well-established paper industry has always been very careful to avoid overusing forest resources and to replant regularly. Xylitol, a sugar that actually helps prevent tooth decay, is derived from birch trees and has now been produced for 40 years. A more modern example is St1 Biofuels, which produces car fuel from biowaste. Paint, glue and rubber already use a lot of biomass in their production, making them safer and also more durable.<p><p> One product under development with enormous potential is wood cellulose. Textiles made from it are better than cotton, because they are stronger and easier to produce. In effect, you will have clothes made of wood. Wood cellulose can also be used for a new type of plastic: you can make everything from children’s toys to food packaging to medicine from it. It can be biodegradable or long-lasting, depending on its purpose. Bioplastic is set to play a large role in the time ahead.<p><p> “We could even have a 100 percent bio-based car in the future,” says Ritschkoff. Imagine a fully recyclable car, driving on fuel made purely from waste.<p><p>Forestry company UPM is moving into the biofuel market with a wood-based diesel called BioVerno.Photo: UPM<p><p> People are working today to make it happen. It’s very likely our entire lives will eventually be intertwined the bioeconomy, when everything we eat, buy or use has been made from biomass.<p><p> Finland has a bioeconomy strategy that aims to increase bioeconomy production from today’s 60 billion euros to 100 billion euros by 2025, and in the process, create many new jobs and help drive the national economy. It has huge potential: across Europe, the bioeconomy is already worth more than two trillion euros annually and will continue to grow quickly. However, there is still a lot to do if it is to be successful in the long term, including educating new scientists and encouraging new business.<p><p> The current market is not utilising new technology as well as it could, because Finland has a limited number of entrepreneurs. “We need more midsize companies,” says Ritschkoff. “They have the resources that allow investment but can still grow.” <p><p> The ideas and the technology are here, so it’s a question of who’s going to use them to help build their success in a truly sustainable bioeconomy. <p><p> By James Perkins, July 2014<p><p> Natural and human resources<p><p> Truly sustainable bioeconomy<p>", "time": "2014-08-05T10:52:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

He says it has been difficult to keep track of everything, but some tools make this easier. There are sports and diet smartphone apps, and medical devices like insulin pumps also keep records. These separate tools used to exist in isolation and couldn’t work together to give a comprehensive overview. Now Tampere-based Sensotrend has developed a solution.<p><p>Sensotrend and Innovamo both help make healthcare info conveniently available.Photo courtesy of Innovamo<p><p>“The problem has been getting all this data to a single user interface optimised for diabetes treatment, so that we could really see how different factors affect glucose levels of an individual,” says Mikael Rinnetmäki, one of Sensotrend’s founders. “We collect the data from various wellness trackers and medical devices and present it in a single user interface.”<p><p>Rinnetmäki is a type one diabetes sufferer himself. He says he uses seven different apps and devices to collect the data he needs to enhance his treatment.<p><p>“I’ve finally been able to learn exactly how running lowers my blood glucose,” he says. “Currently I’m learning the effects of stress. I’m able to see how the cortisol hormone from constant stress keeps my glucose levels elevated. All of this is really personal, and our bodies change constantly as our lives change, so each person with diabetes needs to track all that data themselves.”<p><p>Many people with diabetes or other conditions wear medical alert jewellery in order to inform medics of their condition. Historically these have been simple bracelets or necklaces, but they have serious limitations.<p><p>“The old bracelets have very limited information,” says John Caesar of the Finnish company Innovamo. “Any information on the bracelet is easily visible and not everyone wants to share their medical condition such as epilepsy in a social setting. They’re also not easily updateable.”<p><p>Medical staff can immediately access health data with just the tap of a smartphone if the patient is wearing a SOS-ICE wristband.Photo courtesy of Innovamo<p><p>Innovamo has developed an ingenious solution to this old problem.

It’s time to play your way to wellbeing. We meet two Finnish women who are creating health apps and wellbeing games that pave the way for an active lifestyle.<p><p> As mobile health apps grow in popularity, entrepreneurs are adding game-like features to them. “Gaming is a form of motivation to get people to do something that is voluntary,” says Nelli Lähteenmäki, the CEO and cofounder of Health Puzzle and maker of soon-to-be-launched health app YOU, which utilises its users’ health and preference data to inspire them to take what its creators call “healthy, sustainable actions.” In a data-driven app market, YOU aims to be action-focused because, Lähteenmäki believes, “data is just the first step.”<p><p> According to a 2013 report by Research2Guidance, a German firm, there are 97,000 mobile health apps available globally, 70 percent of which target consumer wellness and fitness segments (mostly health trackers). The wealth of health information they create needs to be analysed to create efficient health advancement mechanisms for a wide audience.<p><p>Nelli Lähteenmäki of Health Puzzle spreads the word about her company at Helsinki’s Slush event for startups and investors.Photo: Samuli Pentti/Slush<p><p> Lähteenmäki highlights her app’s scope as follows: “YOU app users are people who have the willingness to improve their health and not necessarily the super-crazy crossfitters.” The app sets small, achievable goals for its users and gradually raises the bar to ensure sustained progress. With a good game design, an entrepreneur also needs to build new linkages to reach the desired target audience and Lähteenmäki seems to have a plan in place.<p><p> “We’ve been partnering with Diacor, one of the biggest healthcare providers in Finland, asking if future doctors could prescribe YOU app as a healthy game promoting micro-actions instead of only drugs and medication,” she Lähteenmäki. Her keen eye for business growth stems from her background in tech and sales.<p><p> Another health app entrepreneur with a sharp business acumen is Tiina Zilliacus, the founder of Gajatri Studio and creator of Yoga Retreat, a casual wellbeing game. She defines gaming as “an amalgamation of creativity, technology and sales.”<p><p> “I’m not a coder,” Zilliacus clarifies. “I like monetisation, calculations and sales.”<p><p>Yoga Retreat includes aspects of business management and yoga.Screenshot: Gajatri Studios<p><p> A yoga practitioner for over a decade, Zilliacus combined her personal interest with her professional experience in mobile content aggregation to create a yoga-themed business simulation game largely targeting women gamers.<p><p> Yoga Retreat, Zilliacus notes, is designed with a two-pronged appeal: “The game works well for those who are interested in pure business simulation management and those who are into yoga.” As a wellbeing game, Yoga Retreat inspires players to maintain a healthy lifestyle by learning and then teaching varied yoga postures in their own retreats.<p><p> The 40 to 50 animations of yoga poses available in the game are all designed meticulously to make a series of seamless videos. “I was filmed demonstrating every yoga asana [posture],” says Zilliacus, “and based on my video, 3D animation models were designed by graphic designers.”<p><p> The road ahead is equally interesting, as she intends to use games as engagement platforms for brands. “For instance, if we make an Amazon platform version and they have an interface allowing us to offer yoga accessories in the game, our business model can extend to sales of real goods.”<p><p> “My next game is going to be based on food,” Zilliacus says.

Netsono’s Petri Hyyppä says band members can be on three different continents and still record, mix and launch a best-selling album together. “They can also run online auditions,” he says, “which can save everyone time and lots of nerves!”<p><p>Perhaps Netsono’s greatest trump card is Juha Torvinen, an original member of one of the most popular rock bands in Finland, Eppu Normaali. As a member of the Netsono team, this old rocker offers feedback to unsigned artists based on his 38-year experience in the music industry. “This program just makes it so simple to make and launch an album,” he says.<p><p>This new kind of ice cube sits over the mouth of the glass, then breaks into small ice cubes when struck.Photo: Sipi Hintsanen<p><p>Claiming to be a world first, Sipi Hintsanen’s patent-pending Breaking Ice Cube is a circular ice cap that sits atop a drinking glass. Designed to crack into five perfect cubes and tumble into a drinking glass with a gentle knock from a knuckle, this unique Finnish innovation needs 200,000 euros to crack into the big time. Hintsanen’s hand-picked advisory team includes an award-winning Finnish bartender; the American Bar at Solo Sokos Hotel Torni in Helsinki; and Snowhow Ltd (snow and ice construction specialists based in Oulu).<p><p>Juho Risku, one of the Midnight Pitch Fest judges and a cofounder and partner at Finnish venture capitalist firm Butterfly, says the main criteria he looks for in startups pitching at this event are the size of the potential market; capital efficiency; and the quality of the business team and their product. “I’ve seen a big improvement in the quality of pitching in Finland over the last few years,” he says.<p><p>This microscope-magnified picture of a piece of fabric is taken with a regular mobile device using KeepLoop’s mobile microscope.Photo: KeepLoop<p><p>Would you like to turn your smartphone into a microscope? Finland’s KeepLoop Mobile Microscope was on show at Midnight Pitch Fest. By attaching a thin, magnetic microscope module over a smartphone or tablet camera lens, anyone can snap high-quality microscopic photographs of anything, from fingerprints and blood samples to insects and fabrics. Even videos of microscopic organisms can be captured and shared on social media.<p><p>“The idea is to open up the microscopic world and make it available to everyone,” says KeepLoop CEO Jaakko Raukola. “School students can use them on biology excursions, storing thousands of images on their phones or tablets and then going back to the classroom to analyse them on computer screens.”<p><p>While a few other similar products exist on the market, this one, designed and manufactured in Finland, possesses two unique features: a flat lens structure, making it extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket, and compatibility with all smartphones and tablets no matter what brand and model. As a startup company, KeepLoop is seeking capital to boost distribution and sales channels across the globe.

{"title": "Finnish industry: constantly adapting to a changing world - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/finnish-industry-constantly-adapting-to-a-changing-world/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Marimekko Corporation is a leading Finnish textile and clothing design company that was established in 1951.Photo: Marimekko<p><p>In a little over ten years, the structure of Finnish industry has changed more than most Finns yet realize. By the end of the 1990s, an economy that had relied for centuries on the country’s vast forests suddenly found that its most important sector, in terms of both value added and exports, was electronics.<p><p>We used to say, “Finland lives on its forests”, but today we would have to add “..and on Nokia”. And it lives very well. But Finland is already undergoing a further transformation, into a service-dominated society.<p><p>At the same time as technology and services have come to the fore, globalization has played its part in the decline of various industries that used to be important. These mainly relied on the home market, though some also did well as exporters. Rising incomes have been another contributing factor, with the result that, for instance, it is no longer profitable to make clothing in Finland, apart from a few top brands such as Luhta and Marimekko.<p><p>Naturally, the range of a small country’s products is always limited – though during the war we even managed to produce petrol from peat. With the growing importance of bioenergy today we might find ourselves returning to this.<p><p>In any case, Nokia and the companies associated with it are now the jewels in the crown of Finnish industry. Nevertheless, even this network of companies has been constantly changing. Relatively simple operations such as the manufacture of mobile phone cases and chargers have already been transferred abroad. Finland is instead left to focus on product development and on making the more demanding handsets and many of the components for them. Although the ‘China effect’ has been frequently mentioned, the amount of manufacturing transferred from Finland to Asia has in fact been rather small.<p><p>The management and R&amp;D units of Nokia and its ‘satellites’ also remain firmly based in Finland. Attracting much-needed experts from other countries to live and work here is not easy though – there’s the long dark autumn, the impenetrable language and higher taxes. But this is partly counterbalanced by Finland’s reputation as a safe and prosperous country where foreigners, too, can enjoy living and working. English is widely spoken, and for much of the year Finland is a country full of light and natural beauty.<p><p>The electrical engineering industry’s roots in Finland go back to the late 19th century, when Gottfried Strömberg built his first generators and electric motors. The company he founded is now an integral and profitable part of the Asea Brown Boveri Group. Other Finnish companies – such as Instru, Vaisala and Neles (now part of Metso) – have succeeded in areas such as industrial automation and medical and meteorological technology.<p><p>Electrical engineering also covers lift and crane production, where Kone Plc and its offspring KCI Konecranes are global leaders. Kone was founded in 1910 as a section of Strömberg, and under the ownership and management of the Herlin family it has grown into one of the three biggest lift producers in the world. Just how is admittedly something of a mystery, as Finland itself does not even have any skyscrapers. Crucial to Kone’s success has been its emphasis on advanced technology (e.g. the first lifts to have no motor room) and its rock-solid ownership base.<p><p>Finland has three major international forest corporations. In the picture jumbo rolls at Stora-Enso Mill in Oulu, Finland.Photo: Stora-Enso<p><p>Wood processing, to produce a wide range of products from planks to pulp and paper, remains another major sector of industry in Finland. Here, too, advanced technology plays an increasingly significant role. Today, the highly paid and trained employees at paper mills tend to sit at computers in a control room, and it is only when some mechanical fault occurs – such as when the hurtling paper web breaks – that technicians rush down to the shop floor and engage ‘hands on’ with the huge machines.<p><p>In today’s pulp mills in Finland, both raw materials and power are used so efficiently that the raw wood fibre is fully utilized in a ‘closed circuit’, and even the waste liquor is burned to produce electricity. In fact, a pulp mill is a kind of power plant, because it generates more electricity than it consumes. As opposed to chemical separation of wood fibres, however, the mechanical separation process required in making papers such as newsprint consumes enormous amounts of energy. Finland also produces many different speciality papers (e.g. Ahlstrom) and paper products.<p><p>Production units in the forest industry have grown constantly in size, leading to increasing concentration of ownership. Finland has three major international forest corporations – Stora Enso, UPM and M-Real – each with Finnish top management. Stora Enso was created as a merger between a large Finnish and a large Swedish company, while UPM has grown through the merging and acquisition of many other Finnish forest industry companies over the years. M-Real’s main shareholders are forest owners, of whom there are several hundred thousand, as Finland’s forests are mainly privately owned by farmers and their descendants. All three of these major corporations have large mills and subsidiaries abroad, too.<p><p>Growth in the forest industry’s markets since 2000 has fallen short of expectations, however, and this has led to global overcapacity. The use of low-priced tropical wood fibre has also caused problems for the forest industry, although the tough fibre grown in northern latitudes remains the most durable material for papermaking. The major forest corporations have had to reorganize their business, and this has included closure of even fairly modern mills, and in Finland too. This has hit local communities hard, especially where the mill has been the town’s main employer for a century or more. Stora Enso has even sold off – at a loss – its recently acquired mills in North America.<p><p>While Finland has numerous independent sawmilling companies, the big papermakers also have their own highly automated sawmill units. Nothing is wasted in the overall process: high-quality logs are sawn into timber, and the waste is used to make pulp or chipboard. Another important field of production is plywood manufacture, mainly using birch. In addition, Finland has a wide range of companies serving the forest industry in sectors such as forest machinery manufacture and the provision of consultancy services (e.g. the global consulting firm Jaakko Pöyry).<p><p>Wood processing also supplies materials for the packaging industry, which includes one of the world’s largest packaging companies, Huhtamäki (e.g. disposable tableware, in which plastic is also a raw material). Wood is of course the most important raw material in furniture, the biggest manufacturer in Finland being Isku and the most famous perhaps Artek, which markets furniture designed by Alvar Aalto.<p><p>Valtra tractors assembly line in Suolahti plant.Photo: Valtra/Lauri Jokela<p><p>The metal and engineering industry has a long history in Finland, but its great breakthrough did not come until the mid 1940s, with the equipment and armaments needed during wartime and the consequent reparations that Finland had to make to the Soviet Union as part of the peace settlement. Since then, a key focus has been on the design and manufacture of wood-processing machinery. Metso, formed from various companies (e.g. Valmet and Tampella), is the world’s leading producer of paper machines, which today are huge and technologically complex units. The market for paper machines suffers considerable ups and downs, a fact inevitably reflected in profits. Other engineering companies produce sawmill and other machinery.<p><p>The engineering company Wärtsilä, established in 1834, is today one of the world’s leading producers of large diesel engines. Assa Abloy, a global leader in the manufacture of locks and locking systems, started off as part of Wärtsilä (the Abloy lock was a Finnish invention). Other well-known names include Cargotec, a leading supplier of cargo-handling equipment (e.g. Hiab, Multilift), Valtra tractors, the Pasi armoured personnel carriers so often seen in peacekeeping operations, and the heavy-duty Sisu trucks manufactured for a range of special uses. Passenger cars are made in Finland under licence.<p><p>The Aker Yards shipyards in Finland are situated in Turku, Helsinki and Rauma. The yard in Turku, with a land area of 144 hectares, is one of the biggest and most modern shipyards in Europe.Photo: Aker Yards<p><p>The war reparations that Finland had to pay the Soviet Union from the mid 1940s can also be thanked for the subsequent growth of shipyards. Starting from that period they became famous as builders of ice-breakers, vessels needed by Finland’s ports every winter to clear shipping lanes through the sea ice. Nowadays luxury cruise liners are the mainstay of shipyards. These yards were gradually transferred to the ownership of the Norwegian Aker Yards, starting in the 1990s, and Aker Yards has itself been recently taken over by a South Korean company. Finnish shipyards have managed to remain open for business despite the fierce international competition in this sector, aggravated though it is by the public subsidies paid in many countries despite every effort made by the Finnish Government to fight the practice.<p><p>Finland has also been a leading producer of oil-drilling platforms. Naturally enough, a country with a lengthy coastline, an extensive archipelago and 200,000 lakes is also known for its sailing boats and other pleasure craft (e.g. Nautor’s Swan yachts).<p><p>International names in metal products include Fiskars, founded in 1649, and its famous scissors, and Tamglass (part of the global Glaston Group), a leading manufacturer of glassmaking machinery. Sports equipment is also made in Finland using not only metal but also plastic and wood. However, many other consumer goods, such as home appliances, are now mostly made in countries where costs are lower.<p><p>Metallurgy, too, has long traditions in Finland. Now an international stainless steel company, the once state-owned Outokumpu is known the world over for developing the flash smelting process for copper production. Many of Finland’s large mines have closed down, so most raw materials now have to be imported. For this reason, companies now tend to focus on high added-value processing of metals, such as copper pipe manufacturing. Recent years have nevertheless seen a resurgence of interest in ore prospecting. Finland has an abundance of minerals, even uranium ore (though this has not yet been mined).<p><p>The most important ore deposit mined today is in Kemi, in northern Finland, where chrome is produced for Outokumpu’s stainless steel grades. Outokumpu’s copper business is now part of the Swedish mining and smelting giant Boliden. Rautaruukki (now known under its marketing name, Ruukki) makes a wide range of products, including sheet steel.<p><p><p><p>The chemical industry’s roots could be said to go back to tar-making, a process in which Finland was one of the world’s leaders in the 17th century, a time when it was still part of the Kingdom of Sweden. The development of the British Empire, for example, was largely reliant on a fleet of seaworthy sailing ships, whose hulls and ropes were protected with Finnish tar. Today, Finland’s chemical industry is based to a large extent on Kemira’s fertilizers and explosives and Neste’s oil refining. Both companies were originally set up for reasons of national security, to safeguard the functioning of society in times of crisis.<p><p>Kemira today is an international group that focuses primarily on chemicals for the forest industry and water treatment. Neste was combined in 1997 with the state-owned power company Imatran Voima to form the Fortum Group. However, the hoped-for synergy did not materialize and Fortum’s oil refining operations have been returned to Neste, whose strengths lie in its expertise in refining Russian crude oil and in the production of environmentally friendly oil products. Petrochemical production is currently owned by Borealis.<p><p>In pharmaceuticals, the leading company Orion also invests heavily in product development, and the German company Bayer Schering’s Finnish subsidiary (formerly Leiras) is one of the world’s leading developers and producers of birth control products.<p><p>A further, though perhaps less obvious, representative of the Finnish chemical industry is Nokian Tyres, known for its Hakkapeliitta winter tyres. Nokian Tyres was actually part of Nokia Corporation prior to 1988.<p><p>Artek markets furniture, lamps and textiles designed by the famous architect and designer Alvar Aalto.Photo: Artek<p><p>Although Finnish design has never been of major economic importance, the sector does nevertheless employ a relatively large number of people and it has been very significant for the country’s image. Manufacture of ceramics, glass and cutlery is now concentrated in the Iittala company, which also owns the brand names Arabia and Hackman.<p><p>Besides Fiskars and the furniture makers already mentioned, other well-known design companies include fashion-wear producers Luhta and Marimekko and a number of footwear manufacturers. The last-mentioned are still largely under family ownership.<p><p>Luhta, owned by the Luhtanen family, is known especially for its winter sports wear, while Marimekko, established in 1951 by the vivacious Armi Ratia, became known in the ‘60s for the modern look of its clothing (favoured by Jacqueline Kennedy, among others). After a difficult interim period, Marimekko was acquired in 1991 by Kirsti Paakkanen, who led it to flourish once again – not least with the aid of classic designs. Ownership has recently changed hands, with a young former banker, Mika Ihamuotila, now at the helm – at the same time he switched from a business dark suit to jeans and a velvet jacket, without a tie.<p><p>Design is an important factor in many other products too, among them lifts and mobile phones. However, Finland’s once significant ‘heavy industry’ of cotton, wool and other textile manufacturing has almost ceased.<p><p>The Raisio Group develops, produces and markets food and functional food ingredients, feeds and malts.Photo: Raisio<p><p>The food industry has also gone through some major changes, largely because joining the EU in 1995 meant abolishing protectionist import licences required for many basic foodstuffs. Nevertheless, Finns still tend to opt for what they see as untainted Finnish foods, partly because of the numerous scares connected with food products in other countries. The structure of the food industry had become very inflexible during the pre-EU days, however, and even today, procurement and processing of foodstuffs remains largely in the hands of producer cooperatives, as in many other countries.<p><p>Today’s food industry in Finland includes the major dairy chain Valio, several large meat-processing companies, the diversified but troubled Raisio Group, three brewers (the two largest owned by international chains), a couple of large coffee processors (e.g. Paulig), bakery chains (e.g. Fazer and Vaasan &amp; Vaasan) and a couple of confectioners, together with various other largish enterprises and a huge number of small ones. Mergers and acquisitions in the sector look likely to continue.<p><p>There were major changes in the construction sector, too, in the 1990s. The cement industry, formerly a cartel, was merged into an international group, while the plastic piping manufacturer Uponor itself opted to go international. In interior fittings, key names include Sanitec, an important producer of bathroom ceramics, and Oras, which makes a wide range of innovative tap systems. Some large building firms have passed into Swedish hands (NCC, Skanska), while big companies remaining in Finnish ownership include YIT, SRV and Lemminkäinen. Despite the considerable concentration of ownership in the construction sector, there are still numerous small local companies.<p><p>Printing companies have mostly merged with publishing houses, where ownership has become heavily consolidated since the early ’80s. The major printing houses are consequently owned by SanomaWSOY, Alma Media, Otava-Kuvalehdet and Turun Sanomat (Hansaprint). Largely because of the rare language, publishing and printing always used to be closely guarded and in Finnish hands, but times have changed. Now, for example, the biggest corporation, SanomaWSOY, has internationalized its magazine and book publishing considerably through corporate acquisitions abroad.<p><p>Nuclear power plant in Loviisa. Unit 1 was operational in 1977 and Unit 2 in 1981.Photo: Fortum<p><p>Finland needs a lot of electricity, for its forest industry and for homes during the fairly long winter. Finland’s energy production is divided as follows: 24% oil, 21% wood fuel, 16% nuclear power, 14% coal and 11% natural gas. Peat, hydropower and wind power are negligible by comparison, as are electricity imports. One half of all the energy consumed in Finland goes to industry, one quarter to heating buildings and one fifth to transport.<p><p>Power generation used to be divided among the formerly 100% state-owned Imatran Voima (now Fortum), municipal power plants and private companies (especially in the forest industry). Today, the picture is changing. Fortum is now a listed company and has acquired businesses in other Nordic countries and also in Russia. Many municipal power companies, on the other hand, have been sold off, for instance to Swedish and German electricity corporations, and industrial owners have also sold some of their power plants. A variety of partners are currently involved in constructing Finland’s fifth nuclear power unit and are among the owners of the power transmission network.<p><p>Though Finland has a lot of lakes and rivers, it is also fairly flat, and most of the viable hydropower had already been harnessed before the end of the 1960s. Nuclear power plays an important role in basic power generation in Finland. In addition, considerable low-cost electricity is produced as a by-product by both the forest industry and district heating plants, although during consumption peaks in particular, coal-fired power plants also have to be used. Electricity is also imported from other Nordic countries and Russia. Another fuel is peat from the country’s extensive peatlands.<p><p>Today’s energy debate is underlined by a concern for climate change, which is why the Government is advocating renewable energy sources, particularly bioenergy. In addition to burning wood processing waste, there are plans to obtain fuel for vehicles in the forests and fields of Finland; but how this should be done is the subject of heated arguments. There are, of course, many underlying interests.<p><p>For all its ardour, the debate on biopetrol, biodiesel or wind power only concerns a tiny portion of Finland’s energy balance sheet. Building new nuclear power plants or increasing the use of natural gas, on the other hand, are high-impact issues. Energy conservation has been a part of the Finnish environmental debate ever since the oil crisis of the 1970s, and indeed Finnish industry has become considerably more energy-efficient.<p><p>The EU too leans heavily towards bioenergy. Finland is already a bioenergy superpower: as the overall aim for the EU is to increase the percentage of renewable energy from the present 5.4% to 12% between 1997 and 2010, Finland already uses 22% to 25% renewable energy, depending on the year. However, even the star pupil must perform better. How much better — that is a topic subject to considerable wrangling in Brussels.<p><p>Critics have questioned the feasibility of bioenergy projects in a northern country with a short growing season. We need wood primarily for wood processing. We do not have the strong, steady winds of the oceanfront.<p><p>Because of the problems inherent in other energy options conducive to combating climate change, nuclear power has gained new importance. Suspicions towards its increased use have become diluted in all political parties. Although the Greens are officially opposed to building new nuclear power plants, the party has decided to remain in the Government even if — or when — the Government proposes just that. It should be noted, however, that there are divisions within all parties on this matter.<p><p>Currently, the Franco-German consortium formed by Areva and Siemens is building Finland’s fifth nuclear power plant at Olkiluoto on the western coast. A sixth and even a seventh nuclear power plant have been mooted by the established energy company Teollisuuden Voima and by the upstart Fennovoima. Both are companies formed of a coalition of industrial and municipal partners; Fennovoima also includes the German energy company EON. Many communities are competing to become the location of one of these new power plants, although there is local opposition too, of course.<p><p>Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, President and CEO of Nokia at the Mobile World Congress 2008.Photo: Nokia<p><p>Nokia’s rise to prominence was the outcome of both farsightedness and some happy coincidences. The original company was a pioneer right from the start, because it founded Finland’s first wood pulp mill, in 1865. It soon added papermaking to its range, and in the 1920s Finland’s leading cable and rubber factories joined the concern. In the ’50s, future Nokia president Björn Westerlund, at that time head of the Cable Works, wisely foresaw that the growth prospects of some of these sectors would be limited. As a result, he decided to set up an electronics division at the company’s Cable Works.<p><p>What followed was a long period of trial and error, and Nokia electronics made a loss for it first 15 years. Indeed, it was jokingly referred to as the company’s ‘cancer ward’ or, less disparagingly, its ‘university’. But all the experimentation gradually built up substantial expertise and a corps of talented experts. Orders from the government and technology subsidies also helped, of course.<p><p>In the late ’70s, Nokia and television manufacturer Salora combined forces to develop mobile phones, and in the ’80s Salora was incorporated into Nokia. As an indication of the progress made by the late 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was famously pictured using the latest handheld Nokia mobile phone to contact the Kremlin while on a visit to Helsinki in 1987. At that time, the phones weighed in at around one kilo. As Nokia grew in the ’80s, it also took a number of costly wrong turns, among them the purchase of SEL, a major German television manufacturer. This was subsequently sold off, as was Nokia’s own computer production, which was sold to ICL.<p><p>In the early 1990s Nokia was in a state of deep crisis, but the new CEO, Jorma Ollila, decided to concentrate on mobile phones and telephone networks and to sell off everything else. The Group’s consequent rise to the top was given an extra boost by the fact that the telecoms market in Finland, albeit small, was deregulated at an early stage. As a result, the world’s first-ever GSM phone call was made in Finland back in 1991.<p><p>The mobile phone market began to expand very rapidly worldwide in the mid ’90s. Nokia shot to the top, becoming the world leader and opening factories around the globe, though it first had to deal with a difficult logistical crisis in 1995, which it solved by creating efficient new operating systems. These helped the company to remain very profitable through into the 21st century.<p><p>Although a little late in catching up with certain post-2000 design trends, Nokia has since consolidated its position as the world’s leading mobile phone corporation. It has weathered the price competition for mass-market inexpensive phones, while also excelling in product development and design for more expensive models.<p><p>Nokia is now focusing on the added-value content of its phones too, and its recent acquisitions include a leading US mapping service provider. It won’t be long before Nokia phones can be used to find your way anywhere in the world. In the mobile networks business, Nokia has joined forces with Siemens. The Corporation also has a new CEO, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, following Jorma Ollila’s departure to chair the board of directors at both Nokia and Shell.<p><p>Several other Finnish companies were to grow to international significance in Nokia’s wake, including the contract manufacturer Elcoteq. As competition has intensified, Nokia’s partners have nevertheless found themselves reorganizing their operations quite drastically.<p><p>The Nokia head office in Espoo.Photo: Nokia<p><p>Finns are aware that the Nokia success story is built on a solid industrial background and history that go back to the 19th century. But how was the giant leap from the backwoods of Finland to the bright international stage of communications possible? Well, it took two men with willpower, foresight and patience, plus a passion for innovation in electricity and electronics.<p><p>Some sixty years ago one of the two iconic figures dreamed, indeed believed, that electronics would have a great future. He was the innovator who laid the foundations of the modern Nokia. He was Björn Westerlund, first CEO of the Nokia group.<p><p>Björn Westerlund, the architect of modern-day Nokia, was born on December 27, 1912 in Hannover, the son of a Finnish engineering student and a German shopkeeper’s daughter. Björn’s father, who would later be one of the family owners of Nokia, had him sent to Finland at the age of eight, when the First World War had made life in Germany very difficult. Later, Björn brought his mother over to Finland from amidst the ruins of post-Second World War Germany.<p><p>Westerlund graduated in engineering and began his career at the Finnish Cable Works. He served in the Second World War, rising to the rank of major. Having been appointed president of the Cable Works in 1956, Westerlund set up an electronics department within the company. Right from the start, he saw that the company’s future would include high technology. The electronics department was initially led by a well-known mathematician, Olli Lehto, who was related to Westerlund.<p><p>The Finnish Cable Works, the Finnish Rubber Works and the old Nokia paper mill, all under the same ownership since the 1920s, were merged by Westerlund in 1967 to form the new Nokia Corporation, of which Westerlund became the first president. The Corporation was instantly one of the largest companies in Finland. At the same time, the electronics department was turned into a separate division.<p><p>Besides creating Nokia, Westerlund was a key figure behind Finnish industry’s construction of a nuclear power station in the 1970s for its joint needs. Considerable political skill was needed for this, as well as good connections with the Finnish President, Urho Kekkonen. In the 1960s, Westerlund served for a short time as Minister of Trade and Industry, and went on to be the first Chairman of the Confederation of Finnish Industries.<p><p>Westerlund retired in 1977. His successor, Kari Kairamo, oversaw a powerful expansionary phase at Nokia; his acquisition of a string of European companies led him to be referred to as “the man who bought Europe”. By the early 1990s, however, the new CEO, Jorma Ollila, was faced with the task of drastically reorganizing Nokia’s operations. At the core of the new company was Westerlund’s electronics business, albeit in a much different form. A dizzying climb to success then followed, and Nokia has not looked back since.<p><p>In the 1970s computers emerged as the flagship products of Nokia Electronics and in the next decade work began on the first generation of car phones. But on the whole things were not going well and by the early 1990s Nokia was in a state of crisis. It was then that Jorma Ollila, who had been invited to take up the position of CEO, decided to concentrate all the company’s efforts on mobile phones, for which the GSM system had just been adopted.<p><p>Jorma Ollila, Chairman of the Board of Directors at Nokia and Shell.Photo: Nokia<p><p>Jorma Ollila, the man who led Nokia to greatness, was born in Seinäjoki on August 15, 1950, the son of an engineer. The town is in the western Ostrobothnia region of Finland, a region whose people are known for their enterprise and persistence. In the 19th century Ostrobothnians were also known for getting into fights, giving the region a Wild West reputation. Ostrobothnia was also the source of many Finnish emigrants looking for a better life in America.<p><p>After a rare opportunity to attend school in the United Kingdom (Atlantic College), Ollila returned to Finland and went on to graduate as a Master of Political Science and a Master of Science (Eng.). In addition, he has a Master of Science degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science. Student politics also attracted Ollila, and he made his contributions under Centre Party colours. He also served as Chairman of the National Union of University Students in Finland in 1973/74.<p><p>Having excelled as a student, Ollila went on to progress rapidly in his career, first at Citibank in London and then in Finland, after which he joined the management echelon at Nokia in 1985. In 1990 he was given front-line responsibility, being appointed to head the Nokia Mobile Phones division. Here, too, he excelled.<p><p>At the end of the ’80s, the Nokia Corporation was suffering a crisis of such severity that even its sale to Swedish rival Ericsson was contemplated. The management and key shareholders (banks and insurance companies) could not agree on the way forward. In the end, changes in management were made, with Ollila appointed CEO in 1992. This saw the start of a major reorganization, in which it was decided that Nokia would concentrate on mobile telephony and telecommunications networks and would sell off all its other business. Shareholding in the company and the company’s operations themselves were extended internationally.<p><p>Nokia quickly became a global player in the ‘90s, led by Ollila’s Finnish ‘dream team’. Entering the new millennium, this group handed over the baton to a new and confident group of Nokia top management – this time not only from Finland but also other parts of the world. Since 2006, Ollila’s work at Nokia has concentrated solely on his role of Board Chairman, and he performs the same role at Royal Dutch Shell.<p><p>Ollila has expressed his views openly on political issues and is currently chairing a think tank, the ‘Finnish Business and Policy Forum’, which is financed by the Finnish business community. He was even asked to put himself forward as a candidate in the Finnish presidential election in 2006. Although he declined, he did not reject out of hand the notion that he could stand in, say, 2012.<p><p>As recently as the 1980s, industry was almost entirely Finnish-owned, and legislation laid down strict limits on foreign ownership. For a long period about 20 per cent of all industry was state-owned. Other important owners were Finnish banks and insurance companies, which were also vital sources of credit, for Finland used to suffer from a chronic shortage of capital. The real interest rate was often also non-existent or even negative, and investment was further encouraged through the taxation system. Privately owned companies’ roots often extended way back to the 19th century, to Finland’s first capitalist entrepreneurs.<p><p>Today, all this has changed. EU membership in 1995 removed the restrictions on foreign ownership, and Nokia, for instance, is nearly 90 per cent foreign-owned, especially by American pension foundations. Finnish banks and insurance companies have given up many of their industrial holdings as part of a process in which some merged into Nordic financial groups (Nordea, Danske Bank). Capital can also be easily obtained nowadays for profitable investment projects, releasing industry from its dependence on the banks. The corporate tax system today correspondingly offers less support for making investments but at the same time more support for corporate solvency.<p><p>The State has sold a large part of its industrial holdings. Nevertheless, the importance of Finnish private ownership is today being re-emphasized, and for this reason inheritance tax is being reduced.<p><p>The Government’s industrial policy used to centre round equitable regional development and state ownership. In the ‘80s, the focus shifted to support for technology and R&amp;D, with the result that Finland has put relatively more money into R&amp;D than most other Western countries – and to good effect. The success of the electronics industry and other high-tech sectors provides clear evidence, though there have been some disappointments, for instance in sectors based on the biosciences. But perhaps their day will come; after all, it took decades before electronics made its breakthrough.<p><p>Source: Statistics Finland<p><p>Source: Talouselämä 20/2007 (500 largest Finnish companies)<p><p>By Jyrki Vesikansa, May 2008<p><p>The writer (born 1941) is a Licentiate in Philosophy and an experienced journalist who has written some dozen books on Finnish companies and the history of Finnish industry in general.

{"title": "Think tanks see an even better Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/think-tanks-see-an-even-better-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>We asked two of Finland’s leading independent think tanks what the future holds for the country. What are the pressing questions of today? And what does a think tank actually do?<p><p>Think tanks, organisations dedicated solely to researching and solving problems, have been around since the 19th century. Referred to as “brainboxes” during the Second World War, their number has increased rapidly since the 1980s as a result of globalisation and the rise of transnational problems.<p><p>The first Finnish think tanks emerged in the 1990s, and now quite a few of them exist. However, many are connected to political parties – if you want to find truly groundbreaking brainstorming, you need to look at the independent cutting edge of Finnish brainboxes.<p><p>These think tanks work on some of the most pressing current and future issues Finland is facing, and without a political backdrop, they are freer than political parties or special interest groups to put forward new notions – or even question the ideas of their owners.<p><p>Acting director Björn Sundell of the Magma think tank hopes that one day Finland will have more foreign-born stars enriching its culture.Photo: Amanda Soila<p><p>Independent think tank Magma, located across from Old Church Park in central Helsinki, forms a hub for Finland’s multilingual and multicultural dialogue. Founded in 2008 to find new ways to promote bilingualism and the use of Swedish – one of Finland’s official languages – Magma has established itself as a leading player in discussing issues of integration and minorities.<p><p>Acting director Björn Sundell finds that in Finland, you still often have to clarify what a think tank actually does. “I think the easiest way to explain think tanks is that they work between the academic world and the political world, popularising difficult processes and issues,” he says.<p><p>According to Sundell, one of think tanks’ key roles involves finding new solutions for old issues. One such challenge is the gap that currently exists between theory and practice in minority rights in Finland. “On paper, the status of Swedish speakers in Finland is very good – you have the right to education, services and court procedures in Swedish,” says Sundell. “But unfortunately this doesn’t [always] happen in practice.”<p><p>Other minorities also face similar issues: “In the past ten years, Finland has changed a lot, and it’s becoming an increasingly multilingual country. The law has changed much, and the rights of immigrants are much better.” While legal framework for foreigners is in place, attitudes have not completely kept pace. Sundell is speaking about more than just employment and the availability of services.<p><p>“We need more hands, we need more workers, but we’ll also get symbols,” he says. He means stars who are foreign-born or who have foreign-born parents, whether they are singers, actors or sportspeople. Although they are not typically Finnish, they will be accepted as Finns.<p><p>Demos Helsinki, another think tank based in the Finnish capital, forms one of the country’s leading independent think tanks despite its relative youth. It was started by a group of young, enthusiastic researchers in 2005, driven by the idea that we urgently need new, more sustainable ways of living and new kinds of democracy that fit the needs of the 21st century.<p><p>Demos Helsinki organises co-creation workshops as part of the Peloton (Fearless) project, which encourages industries to develop products and services that facilitate energy-smart, low-carbon lifestyles.Photo: Noora Isoeskeli/Demos Helsinki<p><p>Demos Helsinki now encompasses eight full-time employees and a wide additional network. It publishes extensive reports on the future of Finland’s society and economy, and experiments in developing services. With coverage in the Guardian, Monocle magazine and the Economist, Demos forms one of Finland’s most visible social actors internationally.<p><p>Though research forms its core, Demos also gets actively involved in creating ways to promote socially responsible living for individuals and companies.<p><p>Researcher Outi Kuittinen believes that in Finland great interest exists in more sustainable living. “There’s a good deal of knowledge and concern about environmental issues, but action lags behind,” she says, describing a challenge that seems to be common in many countries. If there aren’t services that enable action, there is only so much individuals can do.<p><p>Demos Helsinki is pioneering ways to help Finns – and the rest of the world – lead the sustainable lives they want to live. A project called Peloton (Fearless) encourages industries to develop products and services that facilitate energy-smart, low-carbon lifestyles.<p><p>Hardware stores are involved in one Peloton venture: “Renovations are always stressful projects for people, and the added work of finding information about energy-smart solutions for your home can be off-putting,” says Kuittinen. “Hardware stores have started offering services that calculate and compare energy issues, a very easy service for the customer.”<p><p>In a world where corporations and social groups are often portrayed as arch enemies, Demos Helsinki has found an exceptional, unifying role.<p><p>By Amanda Soila, May 2013<p><p>The multicultural way<p><p>Looking into the sustainable future<p>", "time": "2014-07-01T12:22:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "Finnish women progress in games industry - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/finnish-women-progress-in-games-industry/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Several female tech entrepreneurs have become household names in Finland, and more are following suit.<p><p>Maija Itkonen, founder of wireless charging company PowerKiss (subsequently acquired by Powermat), and Tina Aspiala, the brain behind the map-based search engine for restaurants eat.fi, have become well known in Finland for their technological innovations. A new breed of Finnish women entrepreneurs, armed with both technical know-how and creative ideas, are now carving a niche in the gaming industry.<p><p>As a shy young girl, Niina Tuikkala wrote interesting stories and rhymes but stashed them away. She grew up to be a storyteller and the creator of a famous Finnish cartoon series, Hertan Maailma (Hertta’s World, on Finnish national broadcaster Yle), which educates six-to-nine-year-old children using narrative tales.<p><p>“Hertta’s stories are inspired by my kids – I have no imagination at all,” says Tuikkala with a broad smile. The teacher-turned-entrepreneur adds that for her the key is to “subtly insert teachings within layers of games, so that children don’t realise they are learning.” She relies on her past experience as a computer science teacher and her own experience as a parent to design age-appropriate content for her company, Alpakka Media.<p><p>Niina Tuikkala holds a doll version of Hertta, who began in a cartoon show and now appears in online and mobile learning games.Photo: Alpakka Media<p><p>The same goes for Riitta Annala, who worked as a language teacher before starting her own venture, Hawina Productions, in 2012. It creates interactive English language learning games.<p><p>Annala believes that the ability to integrate soft skills with technical programming knowledge helps women entrepreneurs create thoughtful, engaging, fun-filled games. For instance, Annala noticed that people learn written languages easily through games, but there was a dearth of spoken language-learning games. So she decided to create one using a suave voice recognition technology.<p><p>She describes it as “a fine balance between pedagogy and gaming.” The game was launched this year for online and mobile platforms and aims to break away from the conventional method of playing. “We are limiting the use of mouse and other control buttons in our games, thereby relying on the spoken word,” says Annala.<p><p>Women entrepreneurs seem to be steering clear of themes based on violence and competition. Instead they are devising entertaining games that hone leadership skills, stimulate intellectual reasoning and boost confidence. Annala notes that her game “helps young adults face daily situations and conversations by overcoming the language barrier.” Tuikkala says that the character Hertta “inspires children to dream, ask questions and become responsible.”<p><p>Cartoon multitasking: To really be successful, a good game must also have good marketing and merchandise.Photo: Alpakka Media<p><p>However, it’s not enough to create a game that stands out from the crowd. In the age of digital distribution, entrepreneurs have to devise smart marketing and financial strategies. Hertta’s World has come a long way, from animated TV series to online and mobile gaming with a bouquet of merchandise.<p><p>Tuikkala wasn’t very comfortable at first with her book publisher’s idea to produce Hertta in small, souvenir-size books. “I felt my artistic expression was being curbed,” she recalls. Now that they’re on the market, at a price of two euros, they’re selling “like hot cakes,” she says.<p><p>Annala, on the other hand, is strengthening her presence in international markets in Asia and sprucing up her B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-customer) models. To appeal to a wider audience, she is broadening the themes of her games from simple transportation talks to complex pitch sessions for IT fairs.<p><p>Although the likes of Tuikkala and Annala set good examples, the ratio of women entrepreneurs in the games industry is skewed. According to Neogames, there are currently over 200 gaming companies in Finland, but women spearhead fewer than ten of them.<p><p>“Male entrepreneurs are taken more seriously,” says Annala, highlighting gender-bias in funding – a sentiment echoed by many. But at the same time, women are also already viewing technology differently. Initiatives like Rails Girls, founded by Linda Liukas, provide women with first-hand experience of programming and web building and arm them with the tools to script their own success stories.

Nokia is envisioning its place in a world where everyone – and everything – takes part in connectivity.<p><p>Just west of Helsinki, a new tenant has moved into the landmark building known as Nokia House – the sign on the façade has changed from Nokia to Microsoft. With Nokia’s sale of its handset division complete, the company has quietly moved several kilometres north to their new headquarters in Karakallio. This location is much less visible than the former headquarters, but that doesn’t mean Nokia is planning to keep a low profile.<p><p>Nokia’s new CEO Rajeev Suri has been widely lauded for turning its struggling networks division around. The company’s main business unit is Networks, which focusses on providing products and services to telecommunication operators. It has found a good market in fourth-generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE) technologies and is known as an early leader in virtualisation and in implementing cloud technologies.<p><p>Timo Vuori, a professor at Aalto University who has studied strategy processes at Nokia and other companies, thinks Suri is a good choice for CEO, based upon his public image. Vuori also expresses optimism about Nokia’s future in the networks industry.<p><p>“I believe they will continue operating successfully in their industry,” Vuori says. “Nokia is strong in networks and there is no reason to think demand would decrease or Nokia fail to deliver.”<p><p>Nokia’s location-based business HERE is pointing out the address of the company’s new headquarters west of Helsinki.Screenshot: here.com<p><p>Nokia’s second division is the location-based business HERE. It is deeply immersed in the “internet of things,” where physical objects have network connectivity. In particular, HERE is specialising in smart, connected vehicles and wearable technology.<p><p>“I think this is very interesting,” says researcher and journalist Carl-Gustav Lindén, who is currently writing a book about Nokia and the globalisation of Finland. “I think that everybody wants an alternative to Google Maps. The internet of things is the future and robots need to be connected to precise location systems. This is very exciting, actually.”<p><p>While the internet of things includes stationary objects, such as connected home appliances or industrial machinery, HERE’s expertise is in mobility. Smart watches and eyeglasses such as Google Glass may come to mind, but HERE could bring its innovations to the public in surprising ways.<p><p>“I believe there is huge potential in location-based wearable technologies,” Vuori continues. “The market is still emerging, and great innovators such as Nokia have the possibility to shape the market by being proactive and providing new solutions that one cannot fully imagine yet.”<p><p>The third prong of Nokia’s trident of business units is Technologies. This unit primarily manages Nokia’s patents and licenses, but also conducts new research in low-power connected smart multisensor systems and distributed sensing, among other things.<p><p>In April 2014, a banner hung on the façade of Nokia House announcing the company’s move. Before the end of the month, Nokia’s logo was replaced with that of Microsoft.Photo: Mikko Stig/Str/Lehtikuva<p><p>On the surface Nokia’s three units may not have much in common, but in a conference call Suri explains that the connectivity of everyone and everything will allow synergies to develop. He says that all of the recent changes in technology are leading to something often called “the programmable world.”<p><p>“It is a world where physical objects of all kinds – cars, TVs, medical devices, wristbands and more – will have built-in computing power, sensors and connectivity,” Suri says. “These objects will become bound together with intelligence built upon vast amounts of data which is processed in the cloud and used to automate and simplify, to create new services, and to improve peoples’ lives in many areas.”<p><p>Suri says the programmable world needs connectivity to handle massive numbers of devices and exponential increases in data traffic. Additionally, it is necessary to have sensing, location-based and low-power technologies. All of this requires enormous amounts of research and development. Much as Finland’s support was integral to Nokia’s rise to dominance in mobile phones, it is now hoped that national strengths will help in their new sphere of expertise.<p><p>“Nokia has already been working tightly with universities and I guess this will continue,” Lindén says. “It is of national importance, but this kind of research should not know any borders. It is really up to Finnish researchers to prove what they are capable of.”<p><p>By David J.

Their euphoria becomes uncontainable when winter ends and the sea ice thaws. Boatyards along the country’s shores become hives of activity in preparation for the boating season as owners can’t wait to get out on the open water in the sun and the wind.<p><p>A distinguished Finnish member of the fleet of leisure boats that take to the water each spring is the sleek and graceful profile of Nautor’s Swan, a visual expression of all that is romantic and glamorous in sailing boats. The name forms a reminder of Finland’s national bird, the whooper swan.<p><p>Although Nautor has been under Italian ownership since 1998, the vessels still form a Finnish product, crafted at the Nautor yard in the west-coast town of Pietarsaari (known as Jakobstad in Swedish, the predominant language in the area).<p><p>A Nautor Swan takes part in a competition off the coast of Sicily.Photo: Carlo Borlenghi<p><p>Pekka Koskenkylä, a Finnish entrepreneur who dreamed of producing top-quality, high-performance sailing boats, founded Nautor Ltd in 1966, delivering the first in a long line of fibreglass yachts, the Swan 36. Heritage remains a central part of the luxury Swan brand, which retains tight links with Finland and its long and admired tradition of boat- and shipbuilding.<p><p>“It’s quite unique to make yachts of this kind in a place like this,” says sales director Marcus Jungell. “Pekka Koskenkylä had a very strong vision from the start. Part of his dream was to draw on the skills and experience of the excellent craftsmen that are still found in the region.”<p><p>The Swan 36 and subsequent yachts up to the late 1970s were designed by New York architects Sparkman &amp; Stephens, and Nautor’s Swan reputation was sealed when the Swan 65 Sayula II triumphed in the inaugural Whitbread Round the World Race in 1973 and ’74.<p><p>Yachts are associated with both the difficult and dangerous work of racing and the luxurious world of riches and recreation.Photo: Carlo Borlenghi<p><p>“We offer something contemporary, yet the yachts have to stand the test of time, right through the range,” says Jungell. “The boats should always have great sailing performance and feel easy to handle, making good use of space and layout.” High quality, top technology and reliability attract sailing connoisseurs.<p><p>Luxury yachts may move further down the list of must-have items during times of economic uncertainty, and Nautor has experienced its own challenges. Yet Jungell says that a significant market nonetheless continues for Swans. You would expect someone with his job title to say that – but who is buying these boats, and how does Nautor stay on top of things?<p><p>“Our books have orders from all continents,” he says. “Traditional markets are Europe, especially the Mediterranean, but we have new markets in Russia, China, India, Mexico and the Philippines.<p><p>“We’re continuously developing our products. Cruising, for example, is a strong trend and we are responding to this to secure our position in that part of the market, having recently launched a range of performance cruising yachts.”<p><p>Jungell believes that part of Nautor’s Swan appeal is the Finnish-based connection with customers. The customer care team is headquartered in Pietarsaari, and the town’s yacht club also forms the official base for ClubSwan, which offers prestigious trophies for Swans competing in the most important regattas in the Caribbean, Mediterranean, Baltic Sea and North America.

We in Blancco are like missionaries for educating the importance of data destruction.”<p><p>The simple fact is that most people don’t realise how data is stored and erased. Even if you think it has been erased, it might be recoverable.<p><p>“Everything you have saved to your device will be there for eternity unless the necessary steps are taken,” Väisänen explains. “With modern technology, it would be fair to claim that its memory is long and unforgiving.”<p><p>As technology changes and we store data differently – such as on mobile devices or in the cloud – Blancco has had to adapt nimbly to the changing environment. They now offer Blancco Mobile, which cleans smartphones. The company has also come up with innovative solutions to tough problems, such as the selective erasure of data.<p><p>“For example, credit card numbers are erased from databases after charging,” says Väisänen. “This is done to increase security against illegal use and to prevent greater damages if the credit card handler is hacked.”<p><p>Väisänen praises many governments for understanding the importance of data security and imposing fines for breaches. Yet while this is a “top-down” approach, there is also a “bottom-up” way to increase security: through educational institutions.<p><p>Many different kinds of data-security issues exist: Thinking of filing a patent?

[Finnish] companies like F-Secure, Stonesoft and SSH have been great examples of commercialising their findings. But we also have a lot of research on management, education and the ‘soft’ issues of data security.”<p><p>Tampere University of Technology continues the strong Finnish tradition of close partnerships between companies and universities to study both styles.<p><p>“Our students conduct information security reviews for companies,” he says. “This is beneficial to all parties: The students learn the topic, the companies gain reviews and instructions on how to solve problems, and our researchers gain the data about the state of the art of information security management.<p><p>“There are an awful lot of examples of someone’s personal information being misused – unauthorised purchasing, identity theft, blackmail and financial crimes.

You’re driving your car, come around a turn and hit a patch of ice. You were being careful, but there was no way to know that slick spot was there. Until now.<p><p>Detection systems for slick roads form one of the innovative solutions that Finland is contributing to the automotive industry. Others include wooden cars and interactive dashboard displays.<p><p>VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland has developed a novel slipperiness detection system for vehicles – it warns nearby drivers of road conditions. VTT took advantage of Finland’s unique convergence of technical prowess and climatic conditions to come up with their innovation.<p><p>“The idea came when we were analysing information from some other projects,” says Kimmo Erkkilä of VTT. “That led to thinking about how this data could be used to detect slipperiness or lack of grip in general.”<p><p>Modern vehicles already collect information related to driving conditions, such as tyre spin for traction control. In VTT’s slipperiness detection system, a vehicle notices a slick spot and warns the driver. In real time, that data is also sent to a server and shared with other drivers in the area who can see the slick spot on their GPS maps. Additionally, the system can even alert road authorities so they know a particular patch of road needs attention.<p><p>“Our project team consists of specialists in vehicles, ICT and traffic,” Erkkilä says. “VTT has quite a wide range of technical research, which helps us to combine the needed knowledge easily – even if research areas are not that closely related.”<p><p>Blue gloves, green fuel: UPM’s Biofore Concept Car with parts made from wood-based materials, runs on BioVerno, UPM’s novel, wood-based, renewable diesel fuel (jar at far right).Photo: UPM<p><p>Finland has a strong tradition of partnerships and interdisciplinary projects that leverage national advantages.

A lighter car means less fuel consumption, fewer emissions and a smaller lifecycle carbon footprint.”<p><p>The car isn’t completely wooden, but many components have been replaced by wood-based materials such as plywood and tree pulp. The vehicle is roadworthy and street legal, and demonstrates that biomaterial can be used to improve environmental performance without sacrificing quality or safety.<p><p>Additionally, the modern diesel engine runs on UPM’s novel, wood-based, renewable diesel fuel. Even the design of the car comes from nature – its shape was inspired by the pinecone.<p><p>“Finland has a long history with wood-based materials and related science which gives an excellent foundation for developing new wood-based biomaterials,” Konttinen says. “The materials are a real sustainable alternative already today.”<p><p>Audi is premiering the world’s first user-programmable instrument cluster with real-time 3D graphics, created using Finnish firm Rightware’s toolkit.Photo: Audi<p><p>Some of Finland’s pioneering ideas for the automotive industry are ready to be commercialised, but others are already in the market.

As activities in the Arctic increase and the Northern Sea Route opens up for traffic, all while environmental regulations become tighter, the demand for high-quality icebreakers and ice-strengthened cargo ships rises.<p><p>Each winter after the Baltic Sea freezes over, Finnish foreign trade depends greatly on efficient winter navigation. Icebreakers are necessary to keep ports and sea lanes open, and only ice-strengthened ships can move on their own in conditions dominated by ice.<p><p>This has led Finnish ice technology to develop to a world-leading level over the past 50 years.<p><p>In an ice-testing basin, AARC conducts ice model tests for its vessels prior to construction. Photo: AARC<p><p>Aker Arctic Technology (AARC), a Finnish engineering company specialising in ice technology, has taken a global role in the development of advanced arctic ships and offshore solutions. Its areas of expertise include assessing ice loads, developing hull form and ship structure, designing propulsion systems and providing knowledge about winterisation.<p><p>AARC’s current and recent projects include designing an icebreaker for the Canadian Coast Guard; a research vessel for the Polar Research Institute of China; a new 25-megawatt polar icebreaker for Rosmorport, a Russian government company that develops sea transport infrastructure, for escorting ships along the Northern Sea Route and the shallow waters of the Arctic Ocean and river estuaries; and a European research icebreaker intended for multidisciplinary polar research.<p><p>Also, AARC is designing a next-generation Finnish icebreaker for the Finnish Transport Agency.<p><p>AARC played a major part in designing the “John G. Diefenbaker,” to be delivered to Canada’s Coast Guard in 2017. It will churn through ice 2.5 metres (6.5 feet) thick at 3 knots. Photo: AARC<p><p>“All activities in the Arctic are very sensitive, due to the fragile environment,” says AARC managing director Mikko Niini. “Conditions may also be very harsh, with multiyear ice, temperatures down to minus 30 degrees Celsius [minus 22 Fahrenheit] and location far from any infrastructure.<p><p>“We have a strong track record in development of polar icebreakers and a high engineering expertise for all kinds of ice-going vessels so our clients trust us to design vessels that need to perform at all times.”<p><p>An ice-testing basin contributes to AARC’s ability to stay at the top of its field. The company conducts ice model tests for its vessels prior to construction. It also maintains the world’s most extensive database on ice performance.<p><p>Clients for icebreakers include governments, shipping companies in need of reliable cargo vessels, and the oil and gas industry with its plans for drilling activities.<p><p>“During the past years we have worked closely with Yamal LNG [liquefied natural gas], helping them plan their gas exports from Yamal Peninsula to the market,” says Niini. “Cooperation between AARC and Yamal LNG includes developing and designing a carrier to export LNG to the market; planning and designing the Port of Sabetta; and designing the icebreakers to ensure efficient year-round operations.”<p><p>On the world agenda: Eight countries have territory within the Arctic Circle.

So when they can teach their virtual pet game characters, the children learn.<p><p>“If the game character receives the wrong information, no harm is done. In fact, such cases can be used as data for detailed learning analytics.”<p><p>In its studies, SkillPixels has demonstrated a learning improvement of more than 50 percent in specific topics as a result of just two hours of gameplay. “Of course we are also interested in the motivational dimensions of educational gameplay,” adds Ketamo.<p><p>SkillPixels’ approach is based on scientific conceptual learning theories, and it can be applied to any subject: “In addition to SmartKid Maths, we have prototypes for physics, chemistry, geography, biology and languages.”<p><p>In this 10monkeys app, the player helps the apes by solving a barrage of multiplication problems. iPad screenshot<p><p>Mathematics is also the subject of choice for 10monkeys, which has just launched a Spanish-language version of its online learning tool. “One of our team members, Lisen Häggblom, a PhD in mathematics didactics, has been making maths textbooks for children for two decades, and she’d felt for a long time that new technology wasn’t being used well enough in primary schools,” explains managing director Katri Björklund.<p><p>“This inspired us to create a fun and easy-to-use maths learning and teaching tool that would be very easy for teachers to use alongside traditional materials.”<p><p>10monkeys products, says Björklund, are developed together with teachers and students so that their needs can be answered effectively: “We started by focusing on the most fundamental topics in basic arithmetic – addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. More topics will be added in the future.”<p><p>Like SkillPixels, 10monkeys has taken a well-informed and methodical approach to its product development, seeking more than just fast-buck gimmickry. “From the very beginning we have worked closely with top universities to research the usability and effectiveness of 10monkeys,” says Björklund.<p><p>“The most significant impact is the increasing motivation and support for individualised learning. 10monkeys is a personal practice tool for early learners. It lets the children learn at their own pace and motivates with features like stars and badges.”<p><p>Taking off from the onscreen popularity of Angry Birds, Rovio has developed an education concept that extends to the physical kindergarten environment. iPad screenshot<p><p>The highest-profile game to have winged its way from Finland, of course, is Angry Birds, which in autumn 2013 also launched something called Angry Birds Playground in China – it’s a “kindergarten concept based on the idea of fun learning combined with Finnish educational expertise.”<p><p>“The observation that the world of Angry Birds and its characters activate people led our team to think about how this motivation could be used to promote fun learning experiences,” says Sanna Lukander, vice president of entertainment company Rovio, the Finnish “nest” of Angry Birds.<p><p>“The observation that the world of Angry Birds and its characters activate people led our team to think about how this motivation could be used to promote fun learning experiences,” says Sanna Lukander, vice president of entertainment company Rovio, the Finnish “nest” of Angry Birds.<p><p>“The concept consists of teacher training, an inspiring environment and learning products where fun and play are core,” she continues. “Rovio works together with the University of Helsinki CICERO Learning Network as a research partner, and with the teacher education department involved in the teacher training.

The event, held annually in the Finnish capital, attracts investors from all over the world.

In most cases, individuals who are not carriers of the mutation may be released from years of unnecessary restrictions.”<p><p>Studying data: Genetic testing is evolving at a rapid pace and already forms a fast-growing industry in which Finland plays a significant part.

He is thinking about Slush, the largest conference for small, high-tech startup companies in Northern Europe. As a partner in Index Ventures, one of Europe’s most successful venture capital firms, De Rubertis will discover some of the hottest young companies in existence.<p><p>“Yes,” he says in the most enigmatic way. “There are several companies that I am eager to meet at Slush.”<p><p>Slush Helsinki offers a scene for constant pitches, meetings and networking for startups and investors. Photo courtesy of Slush Helsinki<p><p>Slush has exploded in popularity in just a couple of years. It grew out of Aalto University and Startup Sauna, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship. In 2012 Slush attracted some 3,500 attendees from 550 companies and 250 investors over the two-day event. In 2014 the number of attendees surpassed 14,000.<p><p>De Rubertis says there are good reasons for him flying in to Finland from his base in London.<p><p>“Slush offers a concentrated top-level network and networking opportunity you can’t find elsewhere,” he says. “Events like this are very important for Index Ventures.”<p><p>Many of the world’s top venture capitalists agree. Silicon Valley’s Accel Partners, which were early investors in Facebook, are regular attendees. BlueRun, which had success with their investment in Paypal, also comes to Helsinki for the event. In total, investors with about 60 billion euros in venture capital come to Slush.<p><p>Investors like De Rubertis listen to entrepreneur pitches, meet with them one-on-one, and watch presentations in their search for the next Supercell, the phenomenal Finnish gaming company that has been valued at 2.2 billion euros by Japanese investors. Yet while Supercell and Rovio’s Angry Birds have received much attention, there are many other inventive industries at Slush.<p><p>“Life sciences is very important in Northern Europe,” De Rubertis explains. “In Finland there is a great tradition of medical devices and instrument manufacturing, in addition to a very sophisticated focus on digital healthcare and consumer healthcare.”<p><p>Besides gaming and life sciences companies, Slush attracts startups focusing on software, hardware, cleantech and information security, among others. It all takes place in western Helsinki at Cable Factory, a glorious old industrial property which has been renovated to handle such large events.<p><p>While Rovio and its Angry Birds receive much attention, there are many other inventive companies at Slush. Photo courtesy of Slush Helsinki<p><p>Putting together Slush is a weighty endeavour, so organisers have partnered with major firms such as Nokia, Google and Evli Bank.<p><p>Head of wealth management Esa Pensala says Evli does not directly invest in companies presenting at Slush, but they are still closely involved. “Many of our clients have found investments at Slush,” he points out. “These are angel investors, so there will be quite a few there looking at startups.”<p><p>Angel investing is the term normally used for capital placed in very young companies. Yet those investors at Slush need to worry about more than simply finding a good company.<p><p>“We help investors diversify, to make sure the overall risk in their portfolio is correct,” Pensala says. “We help with liquidity matching, so capital needs in the future can be met. We also assist with valuation, and we give advice on taxes and how to structure their ownership.”<p><p>Investors come to Helsinki to find those exciting young companies which have sprouted in Finland in recent years, but they need the correct environment to grow and prosper. Luckily Slush has proven to be nurturing.<p><p>“Slush is nonprofit,” explains Pensala. “We want to support entrepreneurship, and we can encourage the startup scene with Slush.”<p><p>By David J.

They had just supplied elevators to Taipei 101, then the tallest building in the world, and knew elevator technology was not keeping pace with other advances in architecture.<p><p>“While elevators have enabled the rise of city skylines, the technology had reached its height limit,” explains Giuseppe Bilardello, senior vice president of technology and research at KONE. “Elevator travel distances of more than 500 metres are not feasible as the weight of the ropes becomes so great that more ropes are needed to carry the ropes themselves.”<p><p>With KONE’s new technology, future elevator travel could reach heights of one kilometre, twice the current limit. Photo: KONE Corporation<p><p>In the little town of Hyvinkää north of the capital Helsinki KONE researchers got to work. They tinkered and studied and argued over prototypes. Finally, in the summer of 2013, the company announced they had cracked the problem.<p><p>KONE ditched the old steel cables and instead created one consisting of a carbon fibre core covered with a unique high-friction coating. They call it UltraRope and say with this technology future elevator travel could reach heights of one kilometre, twice the current limit.<p><p>“Carbon fibre has excellent strength properties and the coating is highly resistant to wear and abrasion,” Bilardello continues. “The new ultralight rope technology eliminates the disadvantages of existing steel ropes: high energy consumption, rope stretch, large moving masses and downtime caused by building sway. The lifetime of UltraRope is twice as long as that of steel rope.”<p><p>KONE created a cable consisting of a carbon fibre core covered with a unique high-friction coating. They call it UltraRope.

Stora Enso produces cross-laminated timber (CLT), which was used to build a wooden lift shaft in the Finnish Nature Centre Haltia outside Helsinki. CLT is strong enough to be used in place of concrete in load-bearing structures.<p><p>Haltia was created to not only be a showcase for Finland’s natural treasures, but also to demonstrate ecological wooden construction techniques. Taking a step forward in this concept is Wood City, which will be an eight-storey block in Helsinki.<p><p>“Wood City will be the largest wooden quarter of its type in Finland, throbbing with residential, working and hotel life around its courtyard,” says Matti Mikkola of Stora Enso. “Upon completion, Wood City will be a masterpiece of the latest wooden construction that will raise expertise in this field.”<p><p>The design vocabulary of Wood City’s ground floor draws parallels from Finnish nature and aims for a timeless, personal and striking atmosphere.Photo: SRV Woodcity<p><p>Building begins in 2014, and will be overseen by the Finnish construction and project development company SRV. Tuomas Rantsi of SRV says CLT has advanced to the state where it is cost-competitive and a fast solution for urban construction.

Their mission? To pitch their concept to a group of Finnish and international investors in the hope of receiving a financial handshake that will launch their business to markets across the nation and overseas.<p><p>These handpicked investors from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Russia, the UK and the USA flew to the city the locals like to call the capital of Scandinavia to take part in an event billed as the Midnight Pitch Fest. Like the award-winning TV shows ‘Shark Tank’ and ‘Dragons’ Den’, the 70 entrepreneurs were given a microphone, a spotlight on a stage, and five minutes that could change their life. By midnight, the winning pitches were rewarded with prizes or funding proposals.<p><p>According to a Fortune Magazine report in 2012, Oulu is among the seven best new global cities for startups. The article noted that Oulu, with a population of 250,000, is “especially hospitable to companies seeking the mix of talent, curiosity and risk taking that leads to game-changing new products and services”.<p><p>Bill Reichert, managing director of Garage Technology Ventures based in the USA, believes many of the entrepreneurs at Midnight Pitch Fest displayed more business experience and technical training than a lot of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, especially those who have just graduated from university.Photo: Joni Tuomaala<p><p>Many concur that the Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia is ironically responsible for this glowing reputation. When in recent years Nokia massively downsized its Oulu operations, it released close to 2000 skilled engineers into the city’s workforce of approximately 75,000. Since then, Oulu City Council has set up BusinessOulu, whose aim is to support entrepreneurship and boost the creation, operation, growth and competitiveness of local businesses. Midnight Pitch Fest is one initiative that BusinessOulu is involved in.<p><p>Oulu is fast becoming known as the city of startups, according to Lassi Anttonen, ex-Nokia engineer and CEO of MyPose, another Oulu startup pitching at Midnight Pitch Fest. MyPose places interactive touchscreen mirrors in stores and at events, enabling customers to snap photos of themselves with store products and share with friends via social media platforms. The logo of the sponsoring store or event is inserted into each photo.<p><p>“The startup community in Oulu is very open in sharing ideas and experiences,” says Anttonen. “We’re all learning from each other, encouraging each other and bonding during the startup journey.”<p><p>One of the event’s keynote speakers was Bill Reichert, managing director of Garage Technology Ventures, a seed and early-stage venture capital fund based in the USA. “BusinessOulu has been aggressive in putting initiatives in place to try to rope in anyone who is a stakeholder in the financial success of Oulu,” he announces. “There is a breadth of technology and entrepreneurial business talent here.”<p><p>Reichert believes many Finnish startups display more business maturity and technology richness than those in Silicon Valley. “Most Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have less business experience than the Finnish entrepreneurs I met at PitchFest,” he explains.<p><p>Startup CEO does a sit-up: Laturi CEO, Vesa Tornberg, demonstrates what clients of fitness trainers go through in a fitness test using Laturi equipment.

This train set, much loved by Finnish children, represents to Incrosnatu a standard of quality and design that all of his company’s digital products are measured against.<p><p>Kapu’s main focus is the burgeoning child app market, offering youngsters a digital toy box of various delights. Their first app, Kapu Forest, found an audience immediately upon its release in mid-2012, with its collection of forest friends going on to entertain and educate children locally and also in such far-flung regions as China, Uganda and Brazil.<p><p>Kapu Toys’ apps make kids use their brains while they play.Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>“The idea was to do something good for a change,” explains Kapu’s Tuomas Vanamo, the sole father in the four-member crew. “We were each working in advertising for over ten years, and decided to do something different.”<p><p>To these guys, doing something positive for society involves improving the wellbeing of children, and also of their sleep-deprived parents. Utilising jazz music for their apps may be one method for this – a far cry from the grating jingles often associated with children’s playtime. However, it is the subtle presence of learning that forms the core of what Kapu is trying to achieve.<p><p>“It’s easy to put your child in front of the TV while you make dinner,” Vanamo continues. “But, when playing one of our games, kids are actually doing something with their brain at the same time.”<p><p>This approach saw the Kapu crew release their second app towards the end of 2012. Kapu Tickle encourages children to take photographs of their surroundings; the pictures are eventually incorporated into scenes featuring a range of 1950s-era cartoon characters.<p><p>“It automatically makes your kid interact with their environment and other people,” says Hannu Koho, Kapu’s lead programmer. “There are all sorts of apps that are strictly about getting to know ABCs, 123s and things like that. In our games the learning comes accidentally, in a way.”<p><p><p><p>One local company that is tailoring its focus to more direct learning is that of Whopping Apps.<p><p>“Whopping ABCs with Animals shows beautiful photos of different kind of animals for every letter of the alphabet, each of which is also spoken,” explains Whopping Apps’ Mikko Töykkälä. “It also has seamless Wikipedia integration, so parents can easily check relevant info about the animals.”<p><p>Töykkälä’s portfolio of apps also includes eight simple photo and video books for the one-plus age group, exploring the joys of trains and diggers. With over 500,000 downloads worldwide, it seems that this one-time hobby is now turning into a whopping business.<p><p>Peliporkkana (“Game Carrot”) is another Finnish app developer aiming itself at children, with the likes of Tohtori Molekyyli (“Doctor Molecule”).<p><p>“My apps are designed to support children’s learning – or what’s being taught in school, to be more exact,” explains Peliporkkana’s Markus Kuuranta. “I also like to think that my games may reach some children who otherwise wouldn’t be interested in the subject being taught, or in traditional teaching methods.” Currently only available in Finnish, Kuuranta has plans for English versions of his apps. His timing for expansion couldn’t be better, as Kapu’s Koho points out.<p><p>“When we started in 2011 there were maybe three companies who were solely doing children’s games. Now the US App Store has around eight games for kids in the top 25.”<p><p>Children, that’s the game plan.<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, April 2013<p><p>Whopping alternatives<p>", "time": "2013-08-27T12:22:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

Everyone around her was talking about rather interesting things, and she wanted to learn more. “Helsinki is so saturated with technology and startups making applications,” she says. “I study and spend spare time among entrepreneurs – information technology is just in the air. I wanted to learn the basics of how websites and apps are made, whether it is difficult or everybody can actually do it.” Boychenko decided to go to a Rails Girls event, a free workshop that encourages women to learn about building web applications and software. Taking its name from Ruby on Rails, an open source web application framework, Rails Girls has evolved from a single event to a worldwide movement.<p><p>Linda Liukas cofounded Rails Girls to help more women go from online consumers to web creators.Photo: Codeacademy<p><p>“Rails Girls is an attempt to give young women a fun and approachable first experience in software craftsmanship,” says Linda Liukas, who founded the movement along with Karri Saarinen. “I was really solving my own itch – I wanted to learn to code in a supportive environment.” Over two days, participants listen to volunteers talk about diverse topics ranging from designing an app to the social culture around software development. They hear female programmers describe their careers. They get an introduction to programming and put technical jargon into context. They mingle, eat snacks and have fun. But the main part of the event is creation: before the event is completed, all participating women code and deploy a simple web app. “In sum, the workshop sets the girls on a path from users to makers, from online consumers to web creators, by teaching the first steps in understanding the languages and layouts of the web,” Liukas explains. Since that first event in October 2010, Rails Girls has spread around the world, from Beijing to Paris and from Lisbon to Kiev. Guides for local organisers are now available in a variety of languages, such as Japanese and Russian. They are now rapidly approaching their 100th event.<p><p>At Rails Girls workshops, participants learn from women and men who are already established in the technology field.Photo: lynnwallewnstein/flickr cc by-nc-sa 2.0<p><p>“Rails Girls applies an open-sourced, nonprofit model which has enabled us to spread quickly,” says Liukas. “It is a movement because the internet is all about sharing. The backbone of the whole web was built in Finland with open-source technologies like MySQL, Git, Linux and SSH. It was only natural for us to make something that was intended for everyone. Combine that with the Scandinavian ethos of equality and world-class education system and Rails Girls being born here in Helsinki makes total sense.” The organisation receives support from the Aalto Center for Entrepreneurship and all events are funded by local sponsors and staffed by local volunteer experts. Henrietta Kekäläinen helps European organisers, and says it is important for the local community to be engaged. “What we saw is that the more the local technology and programming community was involved, the better the results,” she says. “Rails Girls does not have a commercial or national agenda. It’s really for the good of the community and bringing more women and beginners into the technical side of things.” And they have definitely seen results. Kekäläinen gives an example from Krakow: “Last year we went to the European rails conference Railsberry and Linda gave her speech to show the Rails Girls materials to everyone,” she says. “There were five women at a 350-person conference, excluding the amazing organisers. This year at the 400-person conference, 10 percent were women. I almost had to queue for the bathroom.”<p><p>By David J.

We find out why.<p><p>The engines are huge, the size of buses, and give off a volcanic roar that is only partially muffled by ear plugs. Deep in the belly of the ship, it is as noisy and hot as you might imagine an engine room to be. But there is no smell of fuel oil, no grease, no grime. It is very clean.<p><p>Without words, chief engineer Henrik Fröberg points at huge yellow pipes. Here is where the fuel comes in, he is explaining. Here is where it goes into the engines. He’s showing what makes the Viking Grace cruise ship so innovative. Currently it is the only ship in the Baltic to be fuelled entirely by liquefied natural gas (LNG).<p><p>Chief engineer Henrik Fröberg explains the ship’s energy management system in the control room.Photo: David J. Cord<p><p>“LNG has only 85 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions of heavy fuel oil,” Fröberg explains in the quiet of his office. “Nitrogen oxide emissions are 12 percent. Particulate emissions are only about 10 percent; sulphur dioxide is practically nothing. This is the future.”<p><p>The Viking Grace is part of the thriving Baltic Sea cruise industry and plies the route between the southwestern Finnish city of Turku and Stockholm, Sweden, with an intermediate stop at Mariehamn in the picturesque Åland Islands. The passengers are going to visit friends, or want to take advantage of tax-free shopping, or are simply enjoying the entertainment on board, but all seem to know about the LNG fuel. Viking Line makes sure every crew member can answer questions – even a bartender says he has received training about LNG.<p><p>In 2015 strict regulations will come into force to limit emissions on the Baltic Sea. Viking Grace is the vanguard of a new generation of ships built specifically to meet these rules. The entire vessel was created to be efficient, from LED lighting to a hull that cuts more smoothly through the water.<p><p>“We have a sophisticated energy management system,” says Fröberg. “We have high-efficiency electric motors and pumps. Waste heat is recovered, stored, and re-used. We have motion detectors so lights aren’t on unnecessarily. There are speed control fans for the ventilation system. Even the chef can’t forget to turn the ovens off in the kitchen, because they are on timers.”<p><p>Passengers on cruise ships between Finland and Sweden pass idyllic archipelago scenes like this in the Åland Islands, an autonomous area of Finland located halfway between Turku and Stockholm. Photo: Lis Karlsson/Visit Åland<p><p>The crown jewel of the Viking Grace is the propulsion system. Although the ship has only used LNG so far, the engines are actually dual-fuel, and can use regular diesel if necessary. These special engines were developed by the Finnish company Wärtsilä, a global leader in the field.<p><p>Tomas Aminoff, director of Wärtsilä Ship Power, says they have received orders for these engines to power a wide diversity of ships in regions around the globe.<p><p>“We see more and more interest for LNG as fuel for cruise vessels, and we find it to be natural that the Baltic region, with its sensitive environmental balance and populated areas surrounding it, will be a forerunner in LNG-powered vessels,” he says. “It’s one of the most economical, environmentally sound solutions available today, and with a dual-fuel engine, fuel flexibility is secured.”<p><p>Wärtsilä also helps with the entire natural gas infrastructure and the gas handling system, both on the ship and on shore. Viking Grace is bunkered, or refuelled, during a one-hour process in Stockholm while 2,500 passengers and 800 cars are unloaded and new ones come aboard.<p><p>“This vessel proved, once for all, that LNG as fuel is a totally viable option, even for the most demanding vessel with the highest safety standards,” says Aminoff.<p><p>By David J.

If wanted an indication of the public’s appetite for a crowdfunding platform in Finland, they just received good news.<p><p>“We all thought the response was great,” says Pauliina Seppälä of Mesenaatti.me. “We expected it, because the concept is so wonderful and liberating.”<p><p>Crowdfunding refers to the collective effort of individuals who pool their money to support projects or individuals. It is used for a huge variety of goals, and has helped to fund artists, scientists, charities and small businesses. Those who fund a campaign are compensated through rewards that are unique to that project.<p><p>Although crowdfunding can be used for practically any fundraising purpose, it is often applied to projects with altruistic ideals. The founders of Mesenaatti.me explicitly draw attention to this.<p><p>“We want to make sure we benefit the Finnish culture, society and economy,” explains Seppälä. “We don’t take on projects that do not somehow add to the common good, like a new innovation or work of art.”<p><p>Pauliina Seppälä (right) of crowdfunding platform Mesenaatti.me, with colleagues Marko Tanninen (centre) and Tanja Jänicke, says their projects add to the common good.Photo: Kimmo Mäntylä/Lehtikuva<p><p>One of the pilot projects on Mesenaatti.me was Huili, the first ecological lifestyle magazine in Finland. The young magazine was having difficulty raising money through traditional means, so they turned to crowdfunding.<p><p>“I’m very happy!” says Huili’s editor, Riikka Suominen. “We received more than 8,500 euros, which made it possible to publish our next issue.”<p><p>Suominen says openness was one key to their successful campaign. They clearly stated how much money they needed to publish their next issue and exactly how the funds would be used. She also made a lucid value proposition, so funders would know precisely what they were getting in return.<p><p>“I’m optimistic that crowdfunding will increase diversity in art projects, high-quality journalism and local businesses,” says Suominen. “It looks like people are interested in investing small amounts in stimulating projects that would otherwise have difficulty finding investors.”<p><p>The community-oriented Brickstarter lets people interact with officials on crowdfunding projects, such as new skate parks or communal gardens.Photo: Elina Sirparanta/Visit Finland<p><p>Seppälä draws attention to the fact that the crowdfunding concept is similar to the Finnish social system.<p><p>“Our social system already funds culture, social projects and also innovations, so it is already a sort of crowdfunding system, where people put money together to fund important things,” she says.<p><p>In fact, some organisations are taking this idea a step further, developing similar platforms to be used explicitly for public projects. The Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra has worked on a system that they will make available to the public by open-sourcing their intellectual property rights.<p><p>“Brickstarter is a provocation, to show local government that effective citizen engagement through digital platforms is very possible – and there is huge demand,” says Sitra’s Bryan Boyer. “It would enable people to articulate and advance sustainable ideas about their community. Brickstarter forms a platform to turn possibilities into proposals into projects.”<p><p>Brickstarter has a name similar to the American crowdfunding site Kickstarter, but as its name implies, it would be more about building community-oriented projects. People in a neighbourhood might petition their city for a skate park. Others might want to turn a vacant lot into a communal garden. As such, it would be an innovative hybrid platform: crowdsourcing ideas, interacting with city officials and crowdfunding projects.<p><p>The first application of the Brickstarter method will take place in the city of Kotka, which is partnering with Oxford Research for implementation. The first two projects are building a wind farm and rehabilitating an old harbour area. For the latter, the city is calling for ideas and proposals from the public for grassroots projects.<p><p>“What has been really cool to notice is the commitment and enthusiasm from the highest city administrators,” says Oxford Research’s Jouni Eho. “It will be interesting to see the feedback from the citizens when the mayor pitches to the citizens on a Youtube clip about participation in the city strategy process.”<p><p>By David J.

Photo: Onbone<p><p>New forest industry products include microfibrils, nanocellulose, formable plywood, thermoformable paperboard and biocomposites.<p><p>Microfibrils are obtained from cellulose or wood pulp. The fibrils enable durable, light, wood-based material that, like plastic, can be shaped. It can be used for multiple purposes in paper, hardboard, furniture, automobiles, electronics, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and construction products. The fibrils can replace materials such as plastic, certain chemicals and aluminium. For instance a wrapping film made of nanofibrilled cellulose can be used in food packaging instead of plastic to keep products fresh.<p><p>Composites are combinations of two or several different materials, for example wood and plastic. Woodcast, manufactured by Onbone, is a medical cast made from wood chips and biodegradable plastic. Wood-based casting plaster represents the biggest innovation in the field since the 1970s. Composites can be used also in products as diverse as furniture and car parts, and can also be made of recycled materials that utilise wood-derived fibres extracted from paper. Many of the composites are easily formable into different shapes. They have also proved to be strong and moisture resistant.<p><p>Printed intelligence – electronics that can be rapidly and cheaply outputted by a printing machine – forms an innovation that is already in widespread use. Stora Enso has developed an application especially for pharmaceutical packages, combining the product info with the patient’s medical information.<p><p>NFC (near field communication) is based on a close-proximity radio-frequency identification technique and used in smartphones, toys and games. It allows information sharing between different components and objects. UPM and its cooperation partners have already opened 12 online stores utilising this innovation.<p><p>Wood is being utilised on a completely new scale in both apartment houses and public buildings. Photo: UPM<p><p>Since the Second World War, the major house construction materials in Europe have been stone and concrete. In recent years, environmental awareness has increased the attention given to building materials. At the EU level, it has become clear that building with wood is significantly more environmental friendly than using concrete. So the aim is to reduce concrete construction and increase the use of wood whenever possible.<p><p>This trend opens new markets for Finnish sawmill products, wood and house-construction elements. House packages, in which customers select from various floorplans and a house is constructed using preassembled elements, have been well established for years, and quantities seem set to increase further in the coming decades.<p><p>In Finland and all over Scandinavia, fire safety regulations have been revised in recent years, allowing wood to be utilised on a completely new scale in both apartment houses and public buildings.<p><p>Activating the potential of wood construction on a European scale would have a great effect on reducing climate change. In Finland some 40 percent of new buildings are made of wood. In Europe as a whole, wood represents only about 4 percent of construction.<p><p>With new technologies and methods developing continuously, the possibilities and uses for wood and wood products are unlimited, and will keep the wheels of the Finnish forest industry rolling into the future.<p><p>By Vesa Kytöoja, March 2013<p><p>Biofuels to replace fossil fuels<p><p>Composites and other new innovations<p><p>Wood construction boom<p>", "time": "2013-03-19T14:49:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

A good number of them have probably visited “lifestyle store” Helsinki10.<p><p>It could be easy to mistake the establishment – located amidst the cozy galleries, coffee shops and shops tucked in along Eerikinkatu in the Finnish capital – for something other than a clothing shop. Its arched entrance looks like a regal gateway to an old bank with marble floors and pillars, but the interior is a cabaret of designs, ideas and sounds.<p><p>The space, all 450 square metres of it, is filled with treasures such as exotic jeans, designer shirts and dresses, jackets, shoes, jewellery, accessories, CDs, LPs, coffee table books and even an assortment of designer chewing gum.

Spaces could be more organic and unique. The items for sale might consist of only a few special pieces.<p><p>The revelation turned their minds to new ways of doing business. One of the manifestations of this “new” vision in Helsinki was this shop without storefront windows or gaudy signs.<p><p>The reasoning was that the fashions – paired with the experience of discovery – would sell themselves, like they do in the real world.<p><p>Finnish style and fashion editor Claudia Cifu says that fashion in Helsinki and the world is not dictated by what’s on the runway, but by a mixture of cultures, designs and ideas. The internet hasn’t hurt the trend, either.<p><p>“I like the fact that higher-end fashion seems to take more and more influences from underground culture and music and from different ethnic cultures,” Cifu says from New York while working on a magazine photo shoot.<p><p>“I also like that people who know fashion give more importance to personal style than designer names,” she says. “It’s all about how you work it.”<p><p>Helsinki10, Cifu believes, has taken that mindset to the streets.<p><p>“They brought Helsinki a totally new concept behind a clothing store,” she says. “Even if you can’t afford to buy something there, young people can actually see and touch some runway pieces. Before you could have this experience only if you travelled abroad, or looked at photos in magazines, or on the internet.”<p><p>“I would call this fashion for people in their 20s to 40s,” Cifu continues. “This generation was kind of forgotten before. You could get ladylike clothing from higher-end boutiques, and Benetton, Sisley or Guess type of clothing for young ‘fashion forward’ people. But there was definitely a piece of the puzzle missing before.”<p><p>Prior to Helsinki10’s debut in 2006, Finns had to travel abroad to shop for exotic designer labels like Eley Kishimoto, Ann DeMeulemeester, Bernhard Willhem and Vivienne Westwood.<p><p>Helsinki10 also stocks Finnish designs, which are hot around the world right now. “Marimekko and Ivana Helsinki are very exotic and hyped over here in New York,” Cifu says. “It’s the Scandinavian simplicity in designs and handcraft look that attract the fashion people here.<p><p>“Because music and fashion go many times hand in hand,” she adds, “fashion people are very attracted to the Finnish Goth and heavy metal looks. They’re a bit odd, but everything that’s a bit odd, in the end fashion people embrace it, and it becomes cool.” <p><p>By Mark B.

The Angry Bird, created by Finnish developer Rovio Entertainment, has become one of the most internationally recognisable video game icons of the 21st century. The phenomenal success of Rovio’s franchise is far from a fluke however, as Finland hosts one of the most active and rapidly expanding video game industries in the world.<p><p>The amount of Finnish games companies has exploded in the last two years. Of the 150 companies active in the field in late 2012, as many as 40 percent are startups established in the last two years, according to figures released by Neogames, the Centre of Game Business, Research and Development. The total projected turnover of the industry in 2012 is 250 million euros, almost three times as much as three years earlier. If growth continues at the current rate, the projected total turnover for 2020 is a staggering 1.49 billion euros.<p><p>Developing large-scale titles “demands a very specific set of professionals and resources,” says Bugbear’s Joonas Laakso. Photo: Bugbear<p><p>The heart of the Finnish game industry is Helsinki and its environs, which are home to some 50 companies. Here are the developers of the largest games made in Finland, such as Remedy – famous for the international brands Max Payne and Alan Wake – and Bugbear, which recently completed the development of Ridge Racer: Unbounded for Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.<p><p>According to Bugbear producer Joonas Laakso, the new Ridge Racer is the second-largest development project ever undertaken in Finland, involving 100 developers in Finland and other countries and lasting almost two years. Projects of this scale are rare for a reason, explains Laakso.<p><p>“The development of large-scale triple-A titles demands a very specific set of professionals and resources,” says Laakso. “Even for a studio of our mid-range size, it can be difficult to find capable people from within Finland.”<p><p>According to Laakso, developers of Bugbear’s size are feeling the squeeze from larger studios in the global market. “Major franchises such as Assassin’s Creed and Call of Duty are dominating both release schedules and marketing,” says Laakso. “The situation may change with the coming of a new generation of games consoles.”<p><p>This archer contributes to the melee in Clash of Clans. © Supercell<p><p>The engine of the Finnish games industry is found in the mobile games sector, as a clear majority of companies specialise in mobile platforms. The reasons for this are clear, according to the Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (known by its Finnish abbreviation, Tekes).<p><p>“The cost of building a mobile game is often only a tenth of the budget of a triple-A production,” says Kari Korhonen, head of Skene, the Tekes programme aimed at supporting the games industry. “It’s been easier for small developers to invest in mobile development.”<p><p>A rising star is Helsinki-based Supercell Games, a 70-employee firm whose game Clash of Clans has ranked first of top grossing apps in Apple’s iOS Store in 77 countries. The financial success of the game is based on a free-to-play model, where revenue is generated from in-game microtransactions by the players.<p><p>“Our team wanted to create a strategy game that would be easy to pick up and play and attract wide range of players around the world,” says team leader Lasse Louhento. “We are really surprised about how popular the game has become and how passionate our fans are about it.”<p><p>One of the functions of Applifier’s Everyplay service allows you to share replays of your games on social media.Photo: Applifier<p><p>Another upcoming firm in the field is Finnish startup Applifier, which aims to connect game developers for Facebook and mobile platforms to their audiences.<p><p>Olli Sinerma, producer of Applifier’s mobile game discovery service Everyplay, believes the reason for the rise of Finnish mobile developers is the spread of digital distribution services such as the App Store.<p><p>“Finland has a long standing in the global game industry, but the digital distribution revolution made it easier for us to get to the global market, something which was very difficult back in the old days of ‘bricks and mortar’ game shops,” says Sinerma.<p><p>He also names further reasons for Finnish success in the mobile market: a tech-savvy population, mobile know-how inspired by Nokia and a high level of national education.<p><p>Big action: Bugbear’s new Ridge Racer: Unbounded forms the second-largest development project ever undertaken in Finland. © Bugbear<p><p>The growth of games as a medium has slowly garnered academic interest.

Technology plays an important part here, supporting teaching and learning through an active, hands-on approach.<p><p>One of the main figures behind this project is University of Helsinki professor of educational psychology Kirsti Lonka. “We began to develop active learning methods in the 1980s,” she says. “The physical space and technology don’t really solve anything. It’s the pedagogical idea that matters. The emphasis is on students, student-activity, structuring and receiving information.”<p><p>Smartphones, iPads and other technology are all part of a typical day in the learning lab.Photo: Annika Rautakoura<p><p>Minerva Plaza, a learning lab located in the facilities of the Faculty of Behavioural Sciences at the university, is a learning environment that has been transformed into an architecturally innovative space. It implements technology in larger and smaller spaces for groups of different sizes and various types of events.<p><p>“This is a learning environment of the future for teachers and students, so they can take the conventions to schools,” says project manager Oskari Salmi. “The idea is not to get ahead of technology, but teach teachers to utilise it as well. What’s important here is the transformability of the space; other methods can be also used here, such as drama.”<p><p>The lab contains 12 iPads and 12 Nokia Lumia smartphones configured for use in this space. They utilise Flinga, an app from Finnish startup Nordtouch that enables you to connect mobile devices and classroom teaching aids. Images may be viewed on all screens in Minerva Plaza, including those in the smaller rooms, and everyone may edit the content. The devices allow the student to become involved by editing the same document that everyone sees.<p><p>In one exercise, students introduce themselves by sending pictures of each other from iPads to the big main screen, then organising the photos, matching them with names. Students can also use iPads to associate colours with certain activities to indicate motivation.<p><p>Lauri Vaara, one of the hosts of Minerva Plaza, moves terms around on the screen during a learning sessionPhoto: Annika Rautakoura<p><p>“It’s a space where you can safely experiment with new and different procedures,” says Lauri Vaara, a student of educational psychology and one of the hosts of Minerva Plaza. “Whatever can be found here can be incorporated into teaching at the university, comprehensive school and upper secondary levels, as well as company training. It is challenging to develop activating lectures and teaching methods, to find out how we can make use of technology and how new technology supports new pedagogical scripts.”<p><p>Currently the lab is used by the Departments of Teacher Education and Behavioural Sciences for educational purposes. The aim is to host outside events too, such as company training events, when the university is not using it.<p><p>Learning spaces can be divided and merged, and the spaces are completely soundproof. A huge glass wall enables visibility, a crucial aspect of active learning. “In this environment you can practice what it feels like when someone sees what you are doing,” says Vaara.<p><p>Lonka calls the space neofunctionalistic: “It should be beautiful and user-friendly, inspiring. It is a place where people gather and share their enthusiasm.”<p><p>Even after Helsinki’s year as World Design Capital ends, the lessons of the Engaging Learning Environment are being carried forward, and Minerva Plaza will continue to exist as a learning environment.

That thought got Shakir Abdulkhader, an Indian immigrant entrepreneur in Finland, into the food and grocery business during the economic downturn.<p><p>A software engineer by profession, Abdulkhader moved to Finland in 2010 and worked with Barona IT. However, the lure of business changed the course of his career in 2012. “I’ve an appetite for risks and I’ve always wanted to be a businessman,” he says, beaming with conviction.<p><p>Abdulkhader realised that the Finns were taking a liking towards Asian and African cuisines, but the corresponding grocery market was fragmented. “I knew it’d work if I had a one-stop-shop for various spices and pulses [edible seeds such as beans and peas] imported from India”, he says.<p><p>The idea has worked wonders. His store, Kairali Foods, now has branches in Helsinki and nearby Espoo. It started with a small customer base among fellow Indians, but caters today to people of various nationalities.<p><p>Demand continues to rise for “exotic” groceries. Abdulkhader’s customers are both Finns and immigrants. Photo: Asha Gopalkrishnan<p><p>Marketed through community forums, social media and word of mouth, his business has a solid following. Its strategy includes offering better quality at a cheaper price, and it thrives on variety. Abdulkhader says the key is to keep improvising the product lines based on consumption patterns.<p><p>For instance, Kairali Foods imports fresh vegetables from India every Thursday. That attracts throngs of Indians who get access to Indian vegetables in Finland and opens up a new arena for locals seeking some change on their platter. The already significant and still rising number of Indian, Nepalese and Thai restaurants in Finland further strengthens his supply chain by sourcing groceries from Kairali Foods.<p><p>The credit for this growing network and codependence goes to the internationalisation of Finland. The country is witnessing a steady rise in its immigrant population, providing the perfect springboard for budding entrepreneurs.<p><p>A case in point is the approximately 3,000 Indians in Finland. While most Indians here are employed by IT companies, individuals like Abdulkhader may be setting a trend in motion. Some people with stable job profiles or prospects are turning into entrepreneurs or toying with ideas about starting new businesses. The key attraction for them is the easy and simple process of starting a business venture in Finland.<p><p>Add to that favourable government policies, transparency in operations, liberty to function in a fair market, relatively less competition and the possibility to retain exclusivity, and it’s a basket full of goodies for entrepreneurs.<p><p>Shakir Abdulkhader’s Kairali Foods shows that the scope for growth as an entrepreneur in Finland is huge and the business is rewarding. Photo: Asha Gopalkrishnan<p><p>Apramey Dube, an Indian PhD student at Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki, aspires to start his own marketing and branding consultancy firm in Helsinki. His venture would “bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical application of services,” he says.<p><p>He notes that the scope for growth as an entrepreneur in Finland is huge and the business is rewarding. Such a combination can be hard to find in a country like India, where complex procedures and cutthroat competition result in wafer-thin profit margins. For instance, it takes roughly ten days to get your company registered and patented in Finland, compared to six to eight months in India.<p><p>Perhaps that’s why the Indian community in Finland is putting its creative foot forward. According to Statistics Finland, out of the 1,494 Indians working in Finland in 2010, three percent were self-employed. That number could rise significantly in coming years.<p><p>Some issues, such as the language, need attention. Not only are certain official documents in Finnish, but Indian immigrant entrepreneurs in a customer-oriented industry also need to interact and conduct business in Finnish, which has an effect on their networking. However, entrepreneurs are dealing with the challenge; some are learning Finnish and others plan to partner with a Finnish resource to clear that hurdle. After all, they are shaping their dreams into reality.<p><p>By Asha Gopalkrishnan, December 2012<p><p>Word of mouth<p><p>Creative foot forward<p>", "time": "2012-12-18T11:59:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

Over the past decade, globalisation and societal changes have greatly affected the Finnish forest industry. In a three-part series, we check out where the industry came from and where it’s heading.<p><p>The wealth of Finland derives from its forests – or more precisely, from its wood-processing industry. The forestry branch has definitely played the most important role Finland’s industrialisation, trade and foreign export. Forestry has provided a livelihood for more Finns than any other industry in the country since its independence in 1917.<p><p>Globalisation and structural changes in society have influenced the Finnish forest industry radically, especially over the past decade. In Finland globalisation has had two major effects: Smaller enterprises have merged with the largest companies, and the industry has moved a huge portion of its production abroad.<p><p>Major operation: Sunila Mill in Kotka, southeastern Finland, was designed by world-famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto and began operations in 1938.Photo: Stora Enso<p><p>The modern-day forest industry is better at taking environmental aspects and biodiversity into account during timber harvesting and reforestation.<p><p>Bioenergy, bio-oil and other innovations form significant new segments of the industry alongside older, traditional segments such as paper, pulp, timber and wood products.<p><p>To the Finns, forests also stand for recreation, retreat and leisure – they hold emotional and psychological value. Modern forestry combines economic, environmental and recreational considerations.<p><p>Finns have tended their forests for centuries, but the wood processing industry began to boom in the 1800s (photo from the 1960s).Photo: T. Kaivola<p><p>The Finns were shipping firewood to Stockholm, Sweden and Tallinn, Estonia as early as the Middle Ages. Roundwood was also sold to neighbouring countries at very early dates. In the 1600s tar, which is produced from wood, became Finland’s primary export. Explorers from all over Europe needed it for their journeys. The tar business created a whole new bourgeois class of tar merchants in Finland.<p><p>The first water-powered sawmills were built in Finland in the 16th century and the first manually powered paper mill was established about a century later, in 1667.<p><p>The real boom of the wood processing industry gained speed when steam power was broadly introduced in the mid-1800s. Steam power made sawmills and papermaking into such a flourishing industry that, by the arrival of the First World War, Finland contained about 600 sawmills, 25 paper mills,17 pulp mills and three plywood mills.<p><p>By the time Finland gained its independence in 1917, approximately 75 percent of Finland’s exports came from forest industry.<p><p>In the early 1900s the forest industry brought wealth into the country and catalysed the development of other industrial branches. The Second World War brought a crucial change. Finland was obliged to pay the Soviet Union enormous war debts between 1944 and 1952.<p><p>Nordic pine and spruce offer the most durable material for making paper and grow only in northern latitudes, ensuring that Finland will always have a forest industry.Photo: UPM<p><p>The Soviets wanted the payments mostly in the form of metal industry products such as boats, locomotives, engines, machinery, tools and 30 fully equipped factories. This forced the metal industry to progress, so that in 1949 Finland had the most modern dockyards and foundries in all of Scandinavia. As a result, the metal and chemical industries pulled ahead of forestry in the 1980s in terms of both turnover and export value. The electronics industry took the lead in the late 1990s.<p><p>Since 2000, global trade and structural changes in society have exerted a large effect on the forest business in Finland. In recent years the three biggest forest companies in the country – Stora Enso, UPM and Metsä Group – have moved more than half of their production abroad, first in the 1990s to central Europe, then to the US in the early 2000s and to Latin America and China in the late 2000s.<p><p>Even though approximately 60 percent of the pulp and paper industry has been moved abroad, about 95 percent of the sawmill industry remains in Finland. Research and development operations and new biofuel factories are also located there. Finland has the biggest paper-machine manufacturer in the world, Metso, and one of the biggest forestry machinery manufacturers, Ponsse.<p><p>At present, the forest industry covers around 20 percent of all exports – the third-biggest branch of industry, after electronics and metal. Likewise, the forest industry accounts for about 20 percent of total Finnish industrial turnover and 16 percent of industrial employment domestically.<p><p>Moving seedlings at a tree nursery in Guangxi: Finnish forestry companies have established a presence in China.Photo: Stora Enso<p><p>Two logical reasons explain why Finnish forest companies have moved most of their paper and pulp production to faraway destinations such as China and Latin America.<p><p>The reasons are eucalyptus and the market. Eucalyptus grows in both places and provides quick, low-priced wood fibre. At the same time both places are among the largest future markets for paper products, so savings are also made in transportation costs.<p><p>However, the paper and pulp industry will never disappear completely from Finland. The tough fibre of Nordic pine and spruce is the most durable material for making paper, and grows only in northern latitudes.<p><p>By Vesa Kytöoja, November 2012<p><p>How it all began<p><p>War debts and global markets change forestry<p><p>Mills follow materials and markets<p>", "time": "2014-07-02T08:10:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

It was a perfect match for Söderling’s company, Mobile Brain Bank, which offers mobile application engineers to business customers looking to outsource development.<p><p>“It is an ideal market for Mobile Brain Bank’s services,” says Söderling. “I chose New York because it is the capital of digital marketing and finance, and also because many large companies have a presence there.”<p><p>She enjoys being able to book meetings downtown without having to find her away around New York’s concrete canyons. She also receives other services from Nest New York.<p><p>“I had a clear idea of what type of services I needed, and the guys were able to offer good providers to fill those needs,” says Söderling. “I have set up a US company, opened a bank account and am looking into immigration policies and housing through their services. Through Nest’s contacts I have been able to find customers and leads for sales representation.”<p><p>Companies interested in participating in the programme have to meet specific criteria. Rantala says that revenue and size don’t matter, but the company has to be ready to enter the tough New York market. They have to believe that the company has a chance to succeed and that Nest New York can help. Each company is different, so the service can be individualised.<p><p>Green light, big city: Nest New York aims to give companies a foothold in the tough conditions of the Big Apple.Photo: david.nikonvscanon, flickr.com, cc by 2.0<p><p>“Sometimes this might mean just offering a desk,” explains Rantala. “Sometimes this means a full-time commitment to building the company. In this case we talk about possible equity purchases or investments to make it interesting and successful for both sides.”<p><p>Fees vary upon what the young firm needs. If it only wants office space, it could rent a desk for 500 dollars per month. If it wants the full accelerator programme, fees are agreed upon separately.<p><p>Demand has been high. Rantala says they have already served about ten companies and have ten more currently in the programme, with an additional twenty expected during the autumn.

{"title": "How Finnish robots could save the world - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/how-finnish-robots-could-save-the-world/", "review": "", "content": "<p>ZenRobotics, an environmentally conscious Finnish startup, is bringing in robots to help save us from drowning in waste.<p><p>A colossal sign atop a building near Helsinki Central Railway Station marks the headquarters of ZenRobotics, an award-winning startup company that has steadily gathered media momentum since its appearance in 2007. Its product is a highly intelligent robot whose “brain” is inspired by that of a human, making the waste recycling process more efficient than was ever thought possible.<p><p>“We all know the world is drowning in waste and resources are running out,” says Jufo Peltomaa, marketing director at ZenRobotics. “Why isn’t the same amount of passion and expertise expended on the end-of-life logistics of a product as is consumed in making it? Why is the products’ life cycle linear instead of circular? Factories spew out endless amounts of new things every day, of which 98 percent ends up in landfills within six months of purchase. Most materials – such as metal – could be redirected back to production.”<p><p>Peltomaa believes that after five years of vigorous development and piloting of ZenRobotics’ groundbreaking product, world domination of robots could finally be around the corner. “Robots are no longer the future – they are here,” he says.<p><p>With an increasing amount of big names jumping onto the bandwagon – the latest addition is Kone Corporation’s customer experience director Juho Malmberg – and with the first major deals being signed, Peltomaa might just be right.<p><p>As the waste rolls by on a conveyor belt, the robot moves different kinds of recyclables into various bins.Illustration: ZenRobotics<p><p>The ZenRobotics website, marketing and media releases are far from ordinary – they are tongue-in-cheek creations. They may refer to the company’s experts as a “mad chorus of world domination doctors” or quote the CEO as commenting, “Mwbrahahahaaaaa!” (a representation of maniacal laughter).<p><p>All that could inspire mockery, were it not for the fact that the ZenRobotics team of experts, all at the top of their fields of research, are developing a seriously useful product that has yet to find a rival.<p><p>“When we started ZenRobotics, we applied some practical experience from Hybrid Graphics Ltd, the previous successful technology company Tuomas [Lukka, present director of research] and I were in previously,” says Peltomaa. “We consulted a couple of hundred customers in order to find out where robotics could best help them. From micro-assembly to shipyards, it soon became clear that they all had the same problem: Dealing with objects that a robot is unable to grasp or recognise due to their complex and ever-changing 3D shape.”<p><p>“The idea to concentrate on recycling had its origins in this realisation, for various reasons. For one, it’s easier to get funding for ecological projects, as they are considered increasingly important. Recycling also forms a current megatrend, as it attracts media attention and all companies want to develop their green strategies. Combining recycling with robotics – another megatrend on the rise – seemed like a perfect match. And personally, we love both.”<p><p>ZenRobotics Recycler represents the brainchild product of extensive research, whose foundation is based on principal scientist Harri Valpola’s groundbreaking 20-year study of neurobiology and machine learning.<p><p>The product is currently designed for construction and demolition waste only, but plans for the future include all kinds of solid waste, including commercial metal waste and hazardous waste. As recycling requires separating raw materials from waste, the task is currently too complex for conventional robots and thus mostly done by humans, often manually and in very dangerous conditions.<p><p>Getting a grasp on the future: ZenRobotics Recycler can discern recyclable objects and separate them from other rubbish.Photo: ZenRobotics<p><p>Whereas conventional industrial robots usually have very few sensors and work in simple, predefined conditions with uniform objects of the same material, ZenRobotics Recycler’s “bioinspired” control system uses numerous sensor inputs. This means it functions similarly to the human brain, with a trial-and-error capability to learn from its mistakes and improve at its task.<p><p>The ZenRobotics Brain will, in the long run, form a coherent overview of the situation and reclaim or remove materials from the waste stream as needed. This is unheard of in the robotics world, although we may think otherwise after having watched too many sci-fi films. Peltomaa emphasises that there has never been such a diverse and accurate analysis of waste before. “We are truly revolutionary in this field.”<p><p>Although a ZenRobotics Recycler robot will cost you an estimated one million euros, the market is there and so are the customers. After running pilot projects with Sita Finland (a subsidiary of Sita Environnement, a world-leading water and waste management company), ZenRobotics is starting to sign deals with customers around the world.<p><p>If all goes according to plan, we may see a cleaner, better world soon, a world where robots do the most tedious, hazardous jobs for free without complaint and work round the clock.<p><p>Perhaps that will help us humans concentrate on using less, thinking about what we buy and enjoying what we have.<p><p>A planet is drowning in waste and dramatic music, but there is hope for the future.<p><p>By Anna Leikkari, September 2012<p><p>Mad chorus of maniacal laughter<p><p>Clever people, clever robots<p><p>You’re either with us or against the world<p>", "time": "2012-09-18T12:45:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "Good taste with passion – 21 years rewarded - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/good-taste-with-passion-21-years-rewarded/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Linus Torvalds, a Finnish open source software engineer, has won the prestigious Millennium Technology Prize together with stem cell scientist Dr Shinya Yamanaka. Torvalds’ Linux operating system and Yamanaka’s stem cell research are both unparalleled and revolutionary in their respective fields.<p><p>The world’s most prestigious technology prize has been awarded to Torvalds in recognition of his work initiating the development of the open source operating system Linux kernel – used today by an estimated 30 million people worldwide.<p><p>Linux is the operating system behind most of our digital existence. Drawing cash from an ATM, watching a movie on board of a plane, or playing with your Android smartphone – all these devices have Linux at their core, making work and social life ever so much easier and more pleasurable. According to Torvalds himself, it all comes down to having “good taste” in visual planning and code. And the passion to give it all away for free.<p><p>Developing the Linux operating system has involved the equivalent of 73,000 person-years of work so far – most of it voluntary and unpaid. Linus Torvalds has worked around 21 years on the system himself. This award praises his achievements as having “significantly influenced not only the development of other major operating systems, but the online networking culture and ethical questioning as a whole, as well as the openness of the internet to everyone.”<p><p>Our article on Torvalds in 2000:<p><p>master programmer<p><p>Written by Patrick Humphreys Drawing by Pekka Vuori<p><p> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<p><p>This year is turning out to be an extraordinary one for computing. Perhaps not a very enjoyable time for the richest man on the planet, Bill Gates, with his programs under virus attack and his Microsoft empire facing possible break-up. But all the better for the world’s best-known programmer, Linus Torvalds, who surely also bears the title of best-known Finn.<p><p>It’s hard to trump the achievement of writing a world-class computer operating system at the age of 21. Yet this year Torvalds was back in the headlines as one of the team that has produced a revolutionary new computer chip. And while the Linux operating system is a challenge to Microsoft’s Windows, the Crusoe chip could threaten the other computing giant, Intel.<p><p>The story of Linux is one of the great fables of computing, yet it begins as recently as 1991. That was when Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old student at Helsinki University, decided to write his own computer operating system. Only a nerd would try; most folk buy their computers with the operating system already installed. And only a master nerd would succeed.<p><p>In some important respects, Torvalds’ Linux is better than the world’s principal operating system, Windows. It is more compact and it runs faster. It is also more stable, so it is preferred for use on the Internet, powering web servers that can be left unattended, without operatives to “turn off and then start again”, as Windows still so often requires.<p><p>The Love-letter virus that raced around the world at the start of May was another reminder of the dangers of dependence on Microsoft programs. It was designed to attack features of Windows and its popular e-mail application, Outlook. Linux users were unaffected. In the 1990s the world’s computing stock became a monoculture, like a forest with just one type of tree. Any disease can decimate it.<p><p>But Linux is not just another operating system. It is the outcome of a completely different philosophy, which has made its author into such a cult figure. Torvalds did not copyright his computer code so as to receive payment for his work. Instead, he published it on the Internet and invited other programmers to improve on it and to send their results back to him. By e-mail, of course.<p><p>Linux therefore was and remains a free program. Anyone can use it without charge, on condition that any improvements they make are also uncopyrighted and freely available. The nerds of the world took up Torvalds’ challenge. Of Linux today, only about 2% was written by the master himself, though he remains the ultimate authority on what new code and innovations are incorporated into it.<p><p>Again, the contrast with Windows is striking. How that system works is a proprietary Microsoft secret. An operating system is what controls a computer, but finding out how it does so is a lot harder than looking at the engine of a car. Computers translate everything into ones and zeroes. It is impossible to see what is happening from this digital stream.<p><p>Because the original quantities and instructions that make up Linux have been published, any programmer can see what it is doing, how it does it and, possibly, how it could do it better. Torvalds did not invent the concept of open programming but Linux is its first success story. Indeed, it probably could not have succeeded before the Internet had linked the disparate world of computing experts.<p><p>In making Linux an open language, Torvalds gave up the opportunity of growing rich from his work. This too is part of nerd culture, which thrives on the satisfaction of authorship and the respect of one’s peers rather than a portfolio of shares and a sports car in the drive. Today Torvalds lives in a rented bungalow though, admittedly, in California, where he moved in 1997 to work for a mysteriously secretive company called Transmeta.<p><p>The results of that project were unveiled in January this year, prompting some observers to suggest that the Finnish dragon-slayer was now taking on the world’s foremost chip manufacturer, Intel. Transmeta’s new Crusoe chips contain an array of computing tricks, allowing it to run programs intended for Intel processors but using a fraction of the power. For mobile devices this will be ideal. The first applications are expected this summer.<p><p>Linus Torvalds did not invent the Crusoe, of course, just as most of his Linux system was written by others. But this computing genius has quite a knack for being in the right place at the right time. <p><p>Original article by Patrick Humphreys, 2000 Foreword by Anna Leikkari, June 2012<p>", "time": "2014-07-02T07:22:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "Cancer treatment in Finland getting personal - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/cancer-treatment-in-finland-getting-personal/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finnish doctors are taking creative, patient-oriented approaches to defeating a growing public health problem.<p><p>“I sometimes say that I’m the most indebted doctor in Finland,” says Timo Joensuu, sitting in the conference room of the two-year-old Docrates cancer hospital in Helsinki. Built on a seaside property with help from corporate investors, contributions from friends and loans taken out by Joensuu himself, the hospital has established itself as a model for patient-oriented cancer treatment.<p><p>The concept for Docrates, whose name is a hybrid of the words “doctor” and “Socrates,” arose from Joensuu’s frustration with a patient care model in which doctors stay at an authoritative distance and patients often have to wait for weeks or months before beginning treatment. In diseases such as pancreatic cancer a two-month delay can be critical, and with slower-moving cancers waiting for weeks can result in added distress.<p><p>At Docrates, treatments often begin within 24 hours from diagnosis and doctors and nurses answer calls from patients around the clock. A built-in health centre offers services including exercise and nutrition programs, makeup coaching, massages and acupuncture. Hospital rooms look out over the ocean, and Docrates’s sunny lobby, void of the smell of disinfectants, is decorated with colourful designer chairs.<p><p>Docrates’s sunny lobby, void of the smell of disinfectants, is decorated with colourful designer chairs. Photo: Docrates<p><p>“Socrates believed that people could grasp the truth by thinking for themselves, and we practice the same way of thinking with our patients,” says Joensuu. “We offer personal support and make sure that they are informed. We can never fully predict which treatment is best for each patient, and a doctor-patient relationship is crucial in finding that out.”<p><p>About 24,000 people in Finland are diagnosed annually with cancer. As its prevalence continues to grow, its individualistic nature becomes all the more obvious; cancer appears in countless types and subcategories, each of which responds to a different cocktail of treatments and medications. Due to its inherent mysteries, cancer also leaves behind a trail of uncertainty in communities of patients and survivors. In recent years, forward-thinking Finnish institutions such as Docrates have begun to employ a personalised approach to both patient care and the development of new treatments. The emerging trend of personalised medicine can further brighten Finland’s position on the global scientific map.<p><p>One of Joensuu’s motivations for building a new hospital was his realisation that the public sector did not yet have enough resources to optimise cancer treatment for each individual patient. He collected his first million euros from independent investors, colleagues and friends, and the hospital’s construction was paid for by the life insurance division of Nordea Bank. Docrates is still entirely in Finnish ownership; its largest owner is Lääkärikeskus, a large chain of private medical centres in Finland.<p><p>“In building Docrates we’ve already proven that we can attract tens of millions of euros into cancer research and treatment. In short, we can provide a giant additional resource for this particular field of medicine,” Joensuu says. “Everyone is worried about where the resources for cancer treatment will come from, and a private hospital like this one is a huge opportunity.”<p><p>At Docrates in Helsinki, treatment is more personalised and patient-oriented than at many other cancer hospitals. Photo: Docrates<p><p>Joensuu currently works from about six in the morning to eight in the evening, and continues to answer patient calls around the clock. Six full-time doctors currently work at Docrates, which has so far treated patients from about 25 countries. The clinic has become known internationally by offering the latest treatment options and equipment in one facility. It has, for example, a cyclotron particle accelerator, a GMP laboratory for handling radioactive substances and state-of the art radiation and imaging equipment.<p><p>“We’re not missing anything, so we can optimise treatment in a way that takes into account all different scenarios on the patient’s part,” Joensuu says.<p><p>“Our doctors seem to come back from each conference with three or four new treatments,” says Docrates nurse Jenni Keinänen. “Although I can’t say that one should never give up hope, there is quite a bit of it; even if we aren’t able to cure the cancer, we can increase our patients’ quality of life.”<p><p>Beyond patient care, a different kind of effort to personalise the treatment of cancers is underway at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), run by the University of Helsinki. The institute has begun to make use of Finland’s strong track record in biobanking and genetics to develop ways to determine the best treatments for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other illnesses.<p><p>Most recently, professor Olli Kallioniemi’s research group has begun to apply molecular-level information to the treatment of leukemia. These personalised treatment methods have already been employed in a handful of patients, and clinical trials on individualised leukemia care are expected to begin in 2012 in collaboration with hematologists at the Helsinki University Hospital.<p><p>Nurses help prepare a patient for a form of radiation treatment. Photo: Docrates<p><p>“In the future, public health will make even greater use of genetics – if you have, say, a cardiovascular disease, your doctor would look at your genetic profile in addition to traditional risk factors. Cancer, though, is a completely different ballgame,” says Kallioniemi. “Cancers are very individual to begin with; they are entities with their own molecular profiles that mutate and evolve. However, we can look at genetic profiles to see how a patient will respond to a particular cancer treatment.”<p><p>One of the largest challenges in taking cancer treatments in a new direction is convincing decision-makers to veer from long-standing treatment regimens.<p><p>“Instituting a new treatment method requires a lot of work because existing strategies have such a long-standing foundation,” says Kallioniemi. His group began doing work with advanced leukemia patients because the field has already been employing immunology and genetic testing in diagnostics and treatment selection for years. The clinical trial will be conducted in patients with advanced, treatment-refractory cancers, as introducing alternative treatments as the first line of therapy can be risky. After personalised medicine has been shown to be effective, it can be introduced to patients suffering from less advanced cancers.<p><p>“Of course we have to move gradually, and as we gather more information on a molecular level, we learn to interpret it better and use it to select the best treatments for each individual patient,” Kallioniemi adds. “We don’t yet have a simple answer to how we can employ our approach to the population at large because our health care system it’s not yet ready for individualised medicine. But this is the direction in which cancer treatment is headed.”<p><p>By Laura Palotie, October 2011<p><p>A rich resource<p><p>Decoding treatments<p>", "time": "2012-01-03T13:56:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

Watch out for 12-metre spiders.<p><p>Our guided tour of the new Vuosaari Harbour outside of Helsinki is led by project manager Paavo Mäntylä from Finnsteve, the largest stevedoring (loading and unloading) company in the harbour. He has seen many harbours in the course of his career, having worked on ships and quays ever since he was still at school. The inauguration of a brand-new harbour in November 2008 was a milestone for him.<p><p>“The first day of the new harbour was a memorable one,” says Mäntylä. “We were thrown in at the deep end, since the previous day Helsinki had received its worst snowstorm in 40 years. We had to clear 70 hectares of 50-centimetre-deep snow. It was a huge effort, but we did it.”<p><p>We drive off towards the Finnsteve loading and storage area – for safety reasons we’re not allowed to proceed on foot. As soon as we pass through the electronic access control gates we can see why. A pedestrian would be minuscule compared to the 12-metre gantry cranes, nicknamed “spiders”, and could easily be overlooked and crushed by their gigantic wheels.<p><p>The stringent safety regulations are also in place because the supervision and security systems of the new harbour are compliant with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) and the Customs-Trade Partnership against Terrorism Cost/Benefit Survey (C-TPAT), which regulate how access to and movement within the security area must be monitored. All vehicles entering the area are recorded and their access permits verified.<p><p>“The harbour fulfils the requirements placed on security arrangements at the port of origin for shipments to the USA,” explains Mäntylä.<p><p>We face a field full of stacked containers and lines of waiting lorries. Soon a crane resembling a stick insect approaches a lorry, picks up the container it is hauling and deposits it at a predetermined location. The entire logistics process is guided over wireless networks. Assuming that the documentation is in order, a lorry driver can make a 15-minute turnaround at the harbour.<p><p>“The harbour works so well because the processes are so well planned and goods and vehicles move smoothly,” says Mäntylä. “Although the area is large, its storage capacity is nevertheless limited compared with the volume of goods that can be handled.”<p><p>The quayside is shaped in the form of two large artificial headlands framing a harbour basin. The larger of these is held entirely by Finnsteve. The company’s quays can accommodate four container ships and ten ro-ro ships at a time. For every container ship berth there is a state-of-the-art container crane that can lift two containers at once, allowing the processing of 25 to 35 containers per hour. That crane, 68 metres tall at its full height, places its burden on the ground where it is picked up by a gantry crane and taken to await further transport and processing. Unloading and loading a large container ship or ro-ro ship takes from 12 to 16 hours. The harbour can process ships around the clock if necessary.<p><p>The pride of the ro-ro berths are the two twin-level ramps that allow large vessels to be loaded and unloaded on two decks at once.<p><p>Goods are packed swiftly at a terminal where containers are placed on the outside with their open ends pointing in. A rail line extends to the inside of the terminal hall so that trains can bring their goods – forestry products, for example – directly to the terminal to be loaded into containers and shipped away. The premises are spacious and practical.<p><p>“The facilities here are worlds away from what we had in Länsisatama and Sompasaari [former harbours closer to downtown Helsinki],” says Mäntylä. “We have excellent staff facilities and services, including a canteen, a gym and health care. And, of course, there are four saunas where you can wash up after your working day.” <p><p>By Salla Korpela, September 2009<p><p>Spiders with wheels<p><p>Fifteen-minute turnaround<p><p>State-of-the-art lifting<p><p>Heavy work in good conditions<p>", "time": "2011-10-10T12:24:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

His success story is based on curiosity and innate problem-solving ability – he has no formal technical training.<p><p>The Langh family has been farming at Alaskartano, near the small town of Piikkiö, for generations. Hans Langh’s grandfather dabbled in making agricultural equipment, and when he passed away, his grain dryer project was completed by his grandson. Hans Langh Cleaning Services started in 1973, emulating a Herculean task in removing muck from byres, chicken factories and piggeries using his first patent: a combination high-pressure water hose and vacuum did the job better than rival methods.<p><p>“By the mid-1970s we were doing the same in ships’ engine rooms, wastewater tanks and the like, and then in 1983 I became a shipowner,” says Langh, explaining how he drifted into shipping. Langh Ship was enlarged in 1989 when three newbuildings came into service, then transporting paper and pulp for Finnish firms. “But for the last 20 years, Langh Ship has carried stainless and carbon steel for Finnish producers Rautaruukki and Outokumpu. We now have about 30 patents for our steel transport innovations, with the last ten years seeing proactive R&amp;D cooperation.”<p><p>Plying the seas: Many of Langh Ship’s vessels are named after female family members – in this case Hans Langh’s mother, Hjördis.Photo: Langh Ship Ltd<p><p>Shipping steel coils and plate doesn’t sound challenging – but the field was ripe for innovations to prevent damage to cargo and ships and ensure personnel safety. “There was so much damage when heavy steel was transported,” Langh says. “Steel plates on the bottom of the ship were stacked, and separated by wood planks in between.”<p><p>His original idea was to place coils (weighing 26 tonnes) in Cradle Tween Decks cassettes, higher up than normal in a ship – a previously forbidden practice. This was augmented by the Cradle Cassette at the bottom of a ship’s hold. From these simple creations stemmed a catalogue of products tailored to transport steel more efficiently.<p><p>The cassettes yielded impressive results. Without getting into complicated technical jargon, we can say that the ships’ stability improved greatly, while loading time was cut in half and labour reduced to a single operator. “In the ten years they’ve been in use [there are over 500 leased worldwide], there’s never been a single damaged cargo,” states Langh proudly.<p><p>In the Cradle Tween Decks system, coils of steel are loaded into “cassettes” for a comfortable ocean voyage.Photo: Langh Ship Ltd<p><p>The latest invention is the Hard Open Top Cradle Container (HOTCC) and its duplex version. The HOTCC carries up to 40 tonnes of large steel coils, which can be loaded either directly aboard ship, or in advance on shore and then transported via road, rail or water. The duplex (a stainless steel composite mix) holds an extra ten tonnes of payload, has a longer working life and needs no painting.<p><p>In addition to the removable cover, the HOTCC design incorporates doors at both ends, enabling delivery of other freight on the return voyage, such as scrap metal for recycling, while the duplex can carry foodstuffs or difficult bulk cargoes securely.<p><p>Hans Langh has garnered recognition over the past few years. He was appointed Maritime Counsellor in 2008, and received an honorary doctorate from Turku School of Economics earlier this year – his sole qualification apart from two years at agricultural college.<p><p>Are there more inventions on the way? “You can’t only develop – ideas must also be marketed – but I still have plenty on my mind,” says Langh. <p><p>By John Pagni, September 2010<p><p>Stabilising the onboard situation<p><p>A flow of inventions<p>", "time": "2011-10-05T06:23:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "Alpine land without Alps - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/alpine-land-without-alps/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Levi Fell ski resort in Finnish Lapland rose rapidly to become one of the country’s biggest tourist centres. Local experts have played a key role in this fairytale development.<p><p>Experience teaches lessons, but it can also be a shackle. At Levi, many things were different from other places in Lapland. The most important of these was land ownership: Levi was not controlled by Metsähallitus, Finland’s Natural Heritage Service. Also, the core of the winter tourism business infrastructure – the downhill ski slopes and lifts – remained in local hands. The ski lift company has been the engine driving Levi’s growth, and there have been bitter battles over its ownership. In the late 1990s, the local municipality of Kittilä gained majority ownership, which has remained stable ever since. Now, in any case, there is certainty that the work in Levi and Kittilä is solely targeted at developing the resort.<p><p>Taking the helm at the Levi lifts company, now called Levi Ski Resort Ltd, was Jouni Palosaari, a young building engineer from Kittilä. A tireless background champion of Levi, municipal director Aarne Nikka, wrote in his memoirs in 2003 that the company’s decision to hire Palosaari was “one of the most important in its history”.<p><p>In fact, Palosaari did not have to start from scratch, although from the current perspective the 3,500 hotel beds available at the resort in 1988 seems paltry.<p><p>An active policy of land acquisition was the basis for development – and all sellers were paid equally well. Good plans were made, but many of them were undermined by the recession of the early 1990s. Financing almost dried up completely, as ski lifts were declared to be impossible investments. The leaders at Levi did not give up:<p><p>Jouni Palosaari’s perseverance contributed to making Levi what is today.© Breakthroughs<p><p>“We decided that if there are already enough ski lifts in Finland, then they are in the wrong places,” says Palosaari.<p><p>Levi has had reason to be grateful for the stubbornness of Palosaari and his partners.<p><p>The harsh truth of the recession years was that the death of one business was often the salvation of another, and this was equally true in the downhill ski industry.<p><p>“Three ski resorts, Muurla, Juupavaara and Kivesvaara, were going bankrupt, so I bought all of their equipment.”<p><p>Thus Levi got the country’s newest lifts for next to nothing. Therefore, it was better positioned than its competitors to invest in other areas when construction costs were low.<p><p>The strongest part of Levi’s marketing has been to attract major competitions, which is the hardest-fought battle in downhill sports. Success – “in an Alpine country with no Alps” – is quite a trick in itself.<p><p>“The factors that were blocking us from landing major events were darkness, cold and distance. We had to turn these to our advantage. The international ski federation FIS requires 90 lux of light on the slopes, while television requires 800. We built 900 lux worth of lighting on our competitive slopes. Now we can offer conditions that suit prime-time viewing hours in central Europe.<p><p>“Even the cold has turned in our favour. In February 2004, we had an amazing atmosphere at the opening ceremony of the women’s World Cup event. The next morning, the thermometer showed a reading of -36 degrees Celsius. I thought everything would be ruined. But the Slovenian team was enthusiastically posing for pictures next to a thermometer. No-one complained, and during the day the temperature rose to zero. Some central European resorts had had to cancel competitions that winter because of mild weather, so we were praised for offering real winter conditions.<p><p>“When we applied to host the opening event of the World Cup season in November 2006, we were able to demonstrate that is actually closer in some ways. Whereas in continental Europe you have to drive over winding mountain roads, we have an airport right at the foot of the slopes.”<p><p>In marketing events, organisers have found it good to emphasise the contrasts: on one hand Lapland and winter in seemingly primitive conditions, while on the other hand journalists are offered “Nokialandia” information technology services that far surpass those at other venues.<p><p>As proof that this combination works, the FIS has recently decided that Levi will host the opening event of the World Cup Slalom season annually until at least the year 2012. The television exposure that such events provide is massive. Its value in terms of marketing not only Levi, but all of northern Finland’s winter tourism industry, as well as to the sport itself, cannot be overestimated.<p><p>Originally published in “Breakthroughs – 90 Success Stories from Finland”, 2007<p><p>By Pentti Jussila, March 2009<p>", "time": "2011-10-05T06:21:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

Let Mohan Rajkarne, the country manager of Tata Consultancy Services, tell how it is to work with Finns.<p><p>Tata Consultancy Services, (TCS), is part of the Tata Group, one of India’s largest industrial conglomerates and most respected brands. They have been present in Finland for more than twelve years enhancing customers’ IT services, business solutions and outsourcing, having today more than 1 200 consultants working for Finnish clients.

Photo: Finnair<p><p>Finns have often been described as matter-of-fact types in communication, a description with which Mohan agrees.<p><p>“Always when coming from a different background it takes a little while to understand what people mean,” Mohan states. For example, when listening to presentations Finns tend to sit quietly, a custom which might leave the speakers wondering whether or not their message went through. But soon he realized, “If there is a point to be made, then the point will be made. So if no question is asked, the audience have probably understood.”<p><p>“People interpret situations differently. For example, take ambiguity. Ambiguity in business situations, from our background, at times, is quite all right, whereas, in Finnish situations one really needs to have a well structured plan,” Mohan states and continues, “Since our entire way of doing business is a very planned operation, a structured plan actually helps us in doing business rather than making it difficult.”<p><p>According to Mohan, setting up a business or running one on a daily basis in Finland is not challenging since the authorities follow the same structured method of working:<p><p>“We have regular interaction with the authorities and whether it is for work permits, compliance-related issues or taxation, in all of these matters we have had a high level of harmony with the authorities. And what helps greatly is that they are able to guide one very clearly in what to do and what not to do.”<p><p>Helsinki has been recently selected as the most livable city in the world by the lifestyle magazine Monocle. Photo: Visit Helsinki<p><p>According to Mohan the level of innovation sets Finnish business culture apart.<p><p>“I think it is the reason why I am personally here and why our company is really investing a lot in this market. If you look at the top 30 companies here, it was not that they always had all the natural resources available to them, it was more about how to be able to galvanize available resources and make them work together. And they all came up with breakthrough ideas to be succesful.”<p><p>“That’s really the amazing part to us, and hugely inspirational! What we are doing is therefore to tap into some of that talent, to interact with the young minds and learn from the innovative companies here.”<p><p>TCS has doubled its workforce dedicated to Finnish customers within a year regardless of the fact that 2010 was generally tough on businesses due to the global slowdown.<p><p>“We have been growing at a very good rate and we are even more committed to this particular country.

That year, he published the first of nearly 400 papers in medical and scientific journals.<p><p>Now 58, Alitalo is a dapper gentleman with a salt-and-pepper moustache and a pleasant way of explaining complex concepts. He speaks with a mild American accent, dating back to the early 1980s, when he worked for future Nobel laureates J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus in San Francisco.<p><p>Alitalo has won a string of awards, including the 2006 Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine (475,000 euros) for discovering the first growth factor controlling the formation of the lymphatic vessels. The jury described it as a “breakthrough could lead to innovative anticancer and cardiovascular therapies.”<p><p>In October 2010, he was awarded Norway’s Anders Jahre Senior Medical Prize (125,000 euros) for his “pioneering discoveries relating to the development and growth of lymphatic vessels,” which have led to “new promising approaches to treat cancer and metastases.” In December 2010, Alitalo was honoured with the Earl P. Benditt Award in the US for his “groundbreaking work on angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.”<p><p>More accolades are likely following Alitalo’s latest paper, published in the prestigious American journal Cancer Cell in December 2010.<p><p>On a bitterly cold day just before its release, he explained how it outlines a new strategy of using antibodies to halt the growth of blood vessels. His team’s latest breakthroughs will likely lead to more powerful weapons to battle cancerous tumours. The attack focuses on the blood vessels which they need for growth and the lymphatic vessels they use for metastatic spread – the much-feared stage that is so often fatal for patients.<p><p>Photo: Marja Airio/Lehtikuva<p><p>Alitalo and his teams have earlier shown how the formation of metastasis in lymph nodes can be cut by 50 to 70 percent. This is done with antibodies that prevent VEGF-C – a protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels – from setting up shop in growth factor receptors known as VEGFR-3. These antibodies can also stop the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis.<p><p>In adults, this usually only occurs when a wound is healing or as part of the menstrual cycle. However cancerous tumours also have the ability to launch angiogenesis. Without new vessels to supply oxygen and nutrition, they simply can’t grow.<p><p>Medicines that block angiogenesis are already used to treat some kinds of cancer. However they are often ineffective, and some cancers develop resistance to them. In binding with these receptors, these antibodies must compete with growth factors in the tumour – and can be overpowered by them. It can also be difficult for antibodies to enter the tumour because of irregular blood circulation and high pressure within the growth.<p><p>“The new antibody works on a different principle,” explains Alitalo. “It’s much more effective, even when there are higher levels of growth factors. And if you can inhibit the growth process, you can starve the tumour to death.”<p><p>“According to our new observations,” he says, “the combination of antibodies that block both growth factor binding and dimerisation appears to be more effective than either antibody alone” – creating a synergistic approach that is better than the sum of its parts.<p><p>His identification of growth factors that spur new vessel growth has already led to the clinical approval of the first molecules targeted to fight vessel growth and tumour progression.<p><p>“These findings should translate into improved tumour therapies,” says Alitalo.<p><p>Indeed, some of his team’s antibodies have already been licensed to the US company ImClone – notorious for its association with Martha Stewart – which was recently bought by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly.<p><p>This year, Helsinki University has made three patent filings regarding the new invention.<p><p>Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>“In late November, two companies visited Helsinki to discuss if they will take the licence,” reveals Alitalo. “It’s very likely that a big one might be interested. The timeframe going forward should be very quick. Some of our antibodies are already at the Investigational New Drug application stage in the US. It usually takes four to six months for the FDA to deal with these applications. Then the safety study can start.”<p><p>On the new strategy, he estimates that after the license deal is signed, another year of development will be needed before a similar application can be filed.<p><p>“But the platform for antibody therapy is now there,” he stresses. “These are very safe forms of therapy because they have very minimal side effects. They are our bodies’ own molecules. This also makes it much quicker to develop them.”<p><p>Alitalo Lab at Biomedicum, Helsinki <p><p>By Wif Stenger, December 2010<p><p>Explaining how it works<p><p>Molecules that fight tumours<p><p>Links:<p>", "time": "2010-12-21T22:00:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

A frosty wind was ruffling the feathers of seagulls and the bare branches of the trees along the ocean promenade in Kaivopuisto (Well Park), but a determined queue had nevertheless formed outside of the sturdy, wooden kiosk of Helsingin Jäätelötehdas (Helsinki Ice Cream Factory). Coat-clad families, couples and groups of friends sat on nearby benches and ledges with cones full of colourful ice cream.<p><p>Despite the cold winters, Finns love their frozen treats – a population of 5.4 million consumes 70 million litres of ice cream yearly – and the legendary Helsingin Jäätelötehdas, founded in 1922, enjoys an unabashedly beloved status. Many people have enjoyed the same flavours since childhood, and an informal survey of Helsinki residents will quickly reveal that the brand is widely considered the city’s best.<p><p>Nevertheless, the grandchildren of the Italian immigrant family who started the company still run it with hands-on devotion. The job isn’t always glamorous and the future is by no means certain, but keeping things small has allowed the Magis to maintain the company’s original promise of freshness.<p><p>Mouthwatering: Beautiful pastel colours are part of the package.Photo: Laura Palotie<p><p>The enterprise was started by six immigrant brothers from Tuscany. Noticing the absence of ice cream vendors in the Finnish capital, the brothers began to make ice cream using familiar Italian recipes and opened a cart in the centre of town. During the winters they made and sold angel figurines to make ends meet.<p><p>Today the company is run by sisters Annette and Tina Magi and their husbands Petri and Björn. Its 18 flavours are made in a factory on Mäkelänkatu and sold the following day.<p><p>“We have no plans to expand to store sales because we want our product to be fresh,” Annette Magi says. “On hot days we make the ice cream in two shifts. It never stays in freezer for a month or even a week, and people can taste that. That’s probably why they like it so much.”<p><p>The soft texture, generous portions, pure flavours and deep pastel colours of Helsingin Jäätelötehdas ice cream certainly inspire loyalty. So much so, in fact, that introducing new varieties has proven tricky. They only rarely come out with a new flavour.<p><p>“If we want to introduce a new flavour we have to get rid of one as well, mainly because of space constraints,” Magi says.<p><p>The company’s insistence on remaining small amidst the large, international companies that occupy Helsinki’s other ice cream stands also means looking ahead only a few years at a time. The city periodically allows bidding on the city’s kiosks, and Helsingin Jäätelötehdas is up against companies many times its size.<p><p>Meanwhile, income depends wholly on the weather. “There are a lot of factors we simply can’t control. Weather is the one single thing that brings our sales up or down,” Magi says. “An ice cream cone is such a small purchase that global economic trends don’t affect us. But even one or two rainy summers can be a real blow.”<p><p>Annette’s and Tina’s children are still in their teens, so it’s too early to tell if family ownership will carry on to the next generation. For now, she and her family will continue focusing on the product itself and hoping that the city’s kiosk rental costs will remain within the company’s means.<p><p>“I have no idea what will happen in the future,” she continues. “This really is a Helsinki mainstay and people love it, but it isn’t something you get rich from. This is a lifestyle for us.” <p><p>By Laura Palotie, June 2010, updated July 2015<p><p>Always fresh<p><p>Helsinki mainstay<p>", "time": "2011-01-24T11:28:00+00:00", "type": "business"}

But, quickly realising that working for a large corporation did not chime with his entrepreneurial streak, he resigned in 2007 and returned to his native Finland to help his friends set up a company publishing city guides across Europe.<p><p>“When I came back to Helsinki, I started asking around to find out where the local entrepreneurs convened,” Vesterinen says. “But noticing a clear lack of events and forums, I thought I might as well set up one myself.”<p><p>He had read about OpenCoffee and thought it might be just what Finland needed. OpenCoffees, first introduced by British venture capitalist Saul Klein, are informal events – or “meetups” – in which entrepreneurs, web developers and investors meet each other to chat and network. Vesterinen organised the first Helsinki OpenCoffee Meetup in September 2007.<p><p>Before long, he was approached by Antti Vilpponen and Miikka Kukkosuo, two entrepreneurially oriented web professionals who had just kicked off ArcticStartup, a blog covering the Finnish start-up scene. “We started talking and quickly realised we all shared the same passion for promoting growth entrepreneurship and start-up culture,” Vesterinen recalls. The three men decided to combine forces, Vesterinen joining ArcticStartup as editor.<p><p>At that point, all three had day jobs – Vesterinen in advertising, Vilpponen in internet consulting and Kukkosuo in online gaming. To ensure ArcticStartup received the attention it required, they also took onboard a fourth partner, Karri Saarinen.<p><p>From the beginning, the quartet realised that to truly promote entrepreneurial culture, writing about start-ups had to be complemented with OpenCoffee-style networking events, and so ArticEvenings were born. Besides informal chatting, the concept includes panel discussions featuring experienced entrepreneurs, investors and other members of the start-up ecosystem.<p><p>They also decided that instead of just Finland, ArcticStartup should focus on all the Nordic and Baltic countries. Says Vesterinen, “We soon realised that although all countries did have their own start-up communities, there was very little interaction between them. Our aim is to bring like-minded people together in the entire region.” In addition to Helsinki, ArcticEvenings have since been held in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Reykjavik and Tallinn.<p><p>On the journalistic side, ArcticStartup has become a must-read for anyone wanting to stay up to date with Northern European growth entrepreneurship. The website now attracts 30,000 visitors a month, among them venture capitalists from across Europe and the US looking for companies to invest in. It’s not uncommon for a start-up to be approached by several interested investors after being covered by ArcticStartup.<p><p>According to Christina Forsgård, founder of Finnish technology PR firm Netprofile, “ArcticStartup attracts readers across the globe because the writers are entrepreneurs themselves, so they have first-hand experience of what they are writing about. The website covers cutting-edge technology companies in a way that is highly appealing to international investors, partners and clients. In many ways, they are already doing what others are still only talking about.”<p><p>In March 2010, ArcticStartup received an award from the Finnish Society for Innovation Journalism for its reporting on Finnish start-ups.<p><p>The founding of ArcticStartup has coincided with, and in part contributed to, a general trend of increased interest towards entrepreneurship in Finland, especially among young people. According to a recent survey by the research firm Taloustutkimus, 60 percent of Finns under 24 consider entrepreneurship as a viable career option after graduation – a marked improvement from previous years.<p><p>ArcticStartup focuses not only on Finland, but on all the Nordic and Baltic countries.<p><p>“Starting your own company has become cool in the same way starting a rock band was in my youth,” says Vesterinen.<p><p>He nevertheless finds things Finland can improve on. Firstly, the presence of angel investors and venture capitalists is currently too limited. “But luckily the situation is getting better all the time. I have high hopes especially for the government-backed Vigo programme aimed boosting the Finnish venture capital industry.”<p><p>Secondly, Finland lacks what Vesterinen calls “start-up universities” – consumer-oriented internet start-ups that have grown rapidly into successful companies. “In Silicon Valley, for example, many of the new entrepreneurs started their careers in firms such as Google or Yahoo. Working for a few years in such an environment provides you with skills impossible to attain at any educational institution.”<p><p>One recent milestone for ArcticStartup has been the Finnish mainstream media starting to cite the blog as a source for breaking start-up news. So far this has happened only a few times, but given that the writers are better connected to the start-up community than any reporter from a traditional outlet, the trend is likely to continue.<p><p>“ArcticStartup does not aim to become a mass publication,” Vesterinen says. “Given that we focus solely on providing news and analysis for the start-up community, our readership will probably not grow dramatically from the current numbers.” Instead, the company is constantly looking for new ways to promote entrepreneurship: “We have been consulting other start-ups for a while now in product strategy, public relations and marketing. We are also developing our own software products for small companies.”<p><p>As for Vesterinen himself, he remains constantly on the lookout for new and exciting things. Covering the Nordic and Baltic start-up sector as the editor of ArcticStartup naturally remains a top priority, but he wouldn’t be an entrepreneur unless he had “a few new start-up ideas brewing.” <p><p>By Otto Utti, April 2010<p><p>Events and accolades<p><p>Start-ups rock<p><p>Next stop: more entrepreneurship<p>", "time": "2010-04-21T17:56:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "Moomin Characters Ltd keeps a national treasure in the family - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/moomin-characters-ltd-keeps-a-national-treasure-in-the-family/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Sophia Jansson, niece of Moomin creator Tove Jansson, oversees Moomin Characters Ltd, a company that has a hand in thousands of products worldwide but sells only one thing: Moomin rights.<p><p>Moomin Characters Ltd grew up more or less organically alongside the Moomin books and comic strips that Tove Jansson (1914–2001) penned starting in 1945 with the publication of The Moomins and the Great Flood (Schildts). As the Moomins caught on, product manufacturers came looking to tie in and cash in.<p><p>“In the 1950s my aunt was advised to set up some sort of company,” says Tove’s niece Sophia Jansson, creative director and chairman of the board at Moomin Characters. “She realised she didn’t want to be handling certain things because she wanted to dedicate herself to writing and painting.”<p><p>In 2010, as the Moomins celebrate the 65th anniversary of their first book, “how we conduct business is the same,” Jansson says. Just five people work for the company, but its commercial agent and the three Moomin Shops employ dozens more.<p><p>Moomin Characters doesn’t own any factories, but it influences what is produced and benefits from the sales. “We’re selling rights, not producing goods,” Jansson notes. So the Moomins – or the Janssons, actually – were outsourcing long before high-paid business consultants started using that term.<p><p>Tove Jansson’s niece, Sophia, deals with Moomin commercial rights as chairman of the board at Moomin Characters.Photo: Erja Sandell/Moomin Characters<p><p>The Moomin stories and characters, while universally popular, are especially close to the hearts of readers in Finland. The Moomins amount to semiofficial national symbols, appearing on Finnish design items from Finlayson bedsheets to the Iittala Group’s Arabia-brand mugs.<p><p>Outside of Scandinavia, the Moomins’ largest fan bases are in Japan and the UK. Jansson points out that despite the characters’ special place in readers’ hearts, Moomin rights form a commercial venture – though room also exists for “exhibitions or activities on a nonprofit basis.” More than 200 companies, about 100 of them in Finland, are licensed to use the Moomin name and images for approved products.<p><p>Jansson came to Moomin Characters back in 1997. “I needed a job,” she says. “My father [the late Lars Jansson, Tove’s brother] said, ‘Why don’t you come and work for the Moomin firm?’<p><p>“In the beginning I was his assistant. When he was ill I took on more, and when he passed on [in June 2000] I became art director.” The following year Tove passed away, and a few years later the managing director retired. Sophia acted as art director and managing director until Roleff Kråkström joined her as managing director in 2008.<p><p>Moomin Characters managing director Roleff Kråkström (left) and chairman of the board Sophia Jansson spend quality time with their all-time top sales rep, Moomintroll.Photo: Timo Jaakonaho/Lehtikuva<p><p>Moomin Characters Ltd approves each product and its artwork individually during planning and prototype phases. “That process has tightened up a great deal over the past decade,” says Jansson. “I enjoy the fact that more and more licensees are using Tove’s original artwork, because I think her drawings are excellent, unique and wonderful,” she says. With businesses lining up for permission, how do she and her colleagues determine what’s appropriate? “In the beginning my aunt decided what was a viable Moomin product, then my dad. In general I think our values and guidelines haven’t really changed.<p><p>“You don’t use Moomin in politics, or in connection with violence. You’d like to develop Moomin products as some sort of extension of what the Moomins represent in general, their philosophy.”<p><p>The Moomins experienced a boom period in the 1990s. “In the early ’90s, the general interest was based on the animated TV series,” says Jansson. “The vast majority saw them as a character for the family’s youngest members.<p><p>“Because of the renewed popularity of the Moomins, people also rediscovered the original books and artwork. With the demise of my aunt in June 2001, people got interested in her as an artist and in the original works, as so often happens. That meant a shift in what licensing looked like and what companies were interested in doing with their products.<p><p>“From the Moomins being perceived as characters for small children, I think today the largest target group is adults. Iittala sells vast numbers of Moomin mugs, and kids don’t have that kind of pocket money.”<p><p>The Moomins have attained classic status: “They’re by no means a boom phenomenon – they’re steady sellers. We enjoy the benefits of Moomins having been around for 65 years.”<p><p>For all the talk of grown-up Moomin fans, Puffin Books is releasing a series of boardbooks for very young readers. “They’ve been quite successful selling to publishers around the world,” says Jansson. “Moomin Characters will be looking outside the Nordic countries to see how this takes off.”<p><p>“Puffin has aroused interest on markets where the Moomins have been dormant for years,” says Jansson. “Generally for a character to be successful anywhere in the world, it needs a TV programme or a film. We don’t have a new TV show or really new film now, but we have this publishing programme, and we’ll just see where it takes us.”<p><p>A large variety of Moomin toys exists, but the Moomins also appear on everything from T-shirts and baby bottles to design items such as tableware and bedsheets.Photo: Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva<p><p>The Puffin books form part of the Moomins’ 65th-anniversary celebrations, as do various other campaigns. Iittala is selling a special-edition Moomin mug and donating a portion of the profits to a WWF campaign for cleaner oceans.<p><p>Jansson hopes that the total donation to the WWF from Iittala and other partners will top half a million euros. On another level – one that requires no money and is open to children all over the Nordic countries – an online Moomin contest with an ocean theme encourages kids to see the world the old-fashioned way: by drawing.<p><p>“For Tove, drawing was one of the most important things in life,” notes Jansson. “Today kids are not urged to draw as much. We want to encourage enthusiasm for drawing.”<p><p>The drawing contest and campaign products show that “it’s not all about making money,” says Jansson. “It’s about giving something back to Moomin fans and others, for instance by helping take care of our oceans or getting people to discover the joy of drawing.” <p><p>By Peter Marten, April 2010<p><p>Close to their hearts<p><p>Inherently sustainable<p><p>Classic status<p><p>New directions<p>", "time": "2014-03-11T09:52:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
{"title": "On the frontier of human knowledge – Leena Palotie - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/business-innovation/on-the-frontier-of-human-knowledge-leena-palotie/", "review": "", "content": "<p>This past autumn genetics researcher Leena Palotie was awarded the title of academician in Finland for her pioneering, international career. We take a look at the highlights of that career. [Editor’s update: We are sad to note that Leena Palotie passed away on March 11, 2010 after a serious illness. We have not modified the rest of this article, preferring to leave it in the present tense.]<p><p>Leena Palotie, professor of medical genetics and molecular medicine at the University of Helsinki and the National Public Health Institute, is a fascinating phenomenon in Finnish science circles. Although she’s one of the top researchers in a field that utilises extensive amounts of sensitive personal information, she is both willing and able to explain her work to the public in an accessible manner.<p><p>“Researchers are usually quite careful when they appear in public,” she says. “But I don’t turn down an interview if it has to do with genes. It’s my personal mission. Since society pays for my work, it’s important for people to know more about it. Besides, it’s a lot of fun to talk about these things.”<p><p>Palotie, no stranger to publicity, radiates enthusiasm for her work, and joy in its achievements: “I was lucky enough to go to the US in 1978 for my postdoctoral training. The first gene of the human genotype was identified then and there. That wasn’t previously considered possible. The event became a historic turning point in this field.”<p><p>Palotie realised that genetic research – particularly disease genes and the human DNA – would be her field. She soon joined a small international research group, the UCLA Human Genetics Genome Center, which held the knowledge of genetic technologies and genotypes.<p><p>“I had a chance to be at the frontline of research into a new field from the very beginning. In 2002, when the whole human genome had been identified and was published on the internet, I realised that I had, by chance, joined a fantastic journey into the human being.”<p><p>“The more the human being’s biological background, or genome, is understood, the better possibilities we have to influence the progress of diseases and to facilitate their treatment,” Palotie says. “I want to find out why some part of a human being begins to operate incorrectly. At what stage can we prevent and influence that process?”<p><p>“In the near future, genetic information will increase the precision of diagnosing various diseases. There are, for instance, several different types of depression. If we could use genetic research to recognise which medicine suits which form of depression, the patient wouldn’t need to test various medicines – the right one could be prescribed immediately. That would be a great relief.<p><p>“Genetic research differs in a beautiful way from the rest of medicine, in that there are no previous assumptions about the reasons for diseases.”Photo: Eastpress/Seppo J.J. Sirkka<p><p>“In the long run, we’ll be able to produce totally new medicines with genetic research. We must, however, take the time lag into account. It takes almost ten years from a genetic discovery until a new targeted medicine is available.<p><p>“Genetic research differs in a beautiful way from the rest of medicine, in that there are no previous assumptions about the reasons for diseases. We don’t need to create a hypothesis based on old information on the changes leading to a heart attack. We can go through our genotype and study what kind of genetic profile creates a risk for a heart attack. We have already discovered totally new mechanisms and metabolic ways with genetics, providing opportunities for developing completely new treatments.<p><p>“The next technological leap in the field of genetic research is to be able to find out the genetic risk profiles for various different diseases with one test. I’m convinced that these tests will be used in diagnoses and help with planning treatments for patients.”<p><p>One of Palotie’s significant realisations was that it was worth researching Finnish genes in particular in a focused way.<p><p>“A long time ago, a small number of people moved to this geographic area. They only brought with them a small selection of the genetic forms of humankind – including disease mutations, which then became more concentrated. Since the population has stayed for hundreds of years in the same region – and even as late as in the early 20th century, people still tended to find their spouses within a four-kilometre radius – the same, homogenous genotype remained in Finland to a large extent.”<p><p>“Therefore, it’s been technically easier to find disease genes in Finns than, for instance, in the population of London or Los Angeles. The Finnish population is the best-known in the world when it comes to disease genes. And we are also rapidly discovering the genetic profiles of our most important ‘national diseases’.”<p><p>In addition to the clarity of the Finnish population structure, genetic researchers have been aided by the fact that there has been so much reliable information on the Finns collected in archives.<p><p>“For a long time, doctors here have kept detailed written accounts of what kinds of diseases their patients have,” Palotie notes.<p><p>“In addition, they’ve studied what diseases appear in their patients’ families. A lot of useful information has been recorded in population registries and healthcare files about, for instance, how average height and weight have increased, or how much people have smoked or drunk.<p><p>“One of our strengths is our Nordic social system and our good healthcare system. Citizens volunteer to have their information used, since they trust our healthcare system and research. The response to official surveys is usually 75 to 85 percent. A high level of education plays an important role as well. Finns understand what they are being asked.”<p><p>So what does Palotie most enjoy about her challenging work? “We’re working on the border of human knowledge. We’re looking for answers to questions that people weren’t able to ask yesterday. It’s incredible to realise that you’ve discovered the cause of a certain disease. Even though no one else knows about it yet, it could be used in diagnostics tomorrow.”<p><p> <p><p>By Juha Numminen Originally published in “Breakthroughs – 90 Success Stories from Finland”, 2007; updated December 2009 and March 2010<p><p>Opportunities for new treatments<p><p>Focus on Finnish genes<p><p>Answering new questions<p>", "time": "2010-03-11T11:52:00+00:00", "type": "business"}
