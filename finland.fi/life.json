We thought up a list of small steps you can take – and get to know Finnish culture and lifestyle while you’re at it.<p><p>Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>They say language is the key to a new culture, and challenging yourself is good for your brain. Why not start by learning some simple phrases in Finnish?<p><p>If that’s not challenging enough, we have plenty more material about learning Finnish. How about this, this or this?<p><p>Photo: Courtesy of WSOY<p><p>Want to learn more about Finnish culture? What better way than to read a book? Yes, a book! Here are ten great options to start with – why not read at least one of them this year? They’re ThisisFINLAND’s readers’ favourites, so you should be able to find some of them in your language.<p><p>Photo © ThisisFINLAND<p><p>If you really want to give your brain something new and challenging to work with, try hobbyhorsing for fun and exercise! You can learn the basics with our online tutorial, and proceed to arrange your own hobbyhorsing competitions. You will also find instructions on how to make your own hobbyhorse.<p><p>Photo: Rodeo.fi/Juha Tuomi<p><p>Don’t like cold weather too much? This is something we sure can help you with: Learn how to not only survive winter but even enjoy it! A hint: coffee, warm clothes and snow are the keys.<p><p>Photo: Rodeo.fi/Juha Tuomi<p><p>Since we already mentioned coffee, why not drink coffee the Finnish way? That is, 12 kilograms of coffee per year. We start our day with coffee, drink it at work with colleagues, and every time we visit a friend. Besides, moderate consumption of coffee has been linked with a longer lifespan, and it may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease, among others.<p><p>Illustration: Naomi Wilkinson<p><p>Feel like learning Finnish, drinking lots of coffee or mastering the art of hobbyhorsing is too much for you? Don’t give up! Try to be more like the Finns and build some sisu in yourself! Don’t know what sisu is? Well, there’s no simple translation for it, but reading our article will give you some idea.<p><p>Photo: Juho Kuva/Visit Finland<p><p>Want to see and experience all this for yourself? Take a trip to Finland! Get inspired and plan your vacation, check out what our colleagues at Visit Finland recommend.<p><p> Ice swimming: We mean swimming in freezing water, in a hole cut in the ice. Sounds horrible? Well, it gives you a great feeling afterwards, calms and relaxes, and reduces stress. Some say it also gives you better sleep and keeps colds away.<p><p>Cross-country skiing: It’s great exercise and gives you an opportunity to admire the Finnish landscape. And what’s more, you don’t need to go to the countryside to try it (unless you want to): you can go skiing in a city park as well! But just to be sure: bring a map or a smartphone!<p><p>After those truly Finnish winter activities, here’s your reward: Warm up in a Finnish sauna! It’s especially rewarding after ice swimming, but equally relaxing in the summer after a dip in one of the hundreds of thousands of Finnish lakes. By the way, sauna can keep people healthier, and frequent sauna bathing has been proven to reduce risks of cardiac arrest.

They also enjoy hard-hitting games such as ice hockey. But do you know how much they like libraries?<p><p>Finland takes libraries seriously, as the magnificent new Helsinki Central Library Oodi demonstrates (the name means “ode” in Finnish). It’s a 98-million-euro investment in the people of Helsinki. Organisers strategically picked December 5, 2018 for the grand opening, tying it to December 6, Finland’s Independence Day.<p><p>Finnish people love their books. The Finns are ranked as some of the most literate people in the world, as well as some of the most prolific users of libraries. On average, every resident of Finland borrows 16 items from a library each year.<p><p>“Libraries have historically been important to Finns,” says Katri Vänttinen, the City of Helsinki’s director of library services. “Beginning in the 1800s, every village had a school and a library, and that created equal access to literacy and basic education.”<p><p>Katri Vänttinen, the City of Helsinki’s director of library services, sits with a book at one end of Oodi’s third floor.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>“It used to be the library was about equal access to knowledge, but now most of that knowledge is accessible via your smartphone,” Vänttinen says. “Libraries today need to be thought of as a physical space, a platform for activities such as reading, learning and public discussion. They also provide access to equipment, data networks or expertise. We even have reading coaches who act like personal trainers, but for your reading.”<p><p>Oodi’s layout reflects the new roles of the library. The third floor can be considered the traditional library, with reading areas called “oases” and 100,000 books. The second floor is about creativity, and includes studios, music rooms, media rooms and a makerspace with 3D printers, sewing machines and other equipment. The first floor is for interactions. It has a café, restaurant, cinema, information points and a space curated by the EU.<p><p>“The biggest technical innovation by far is the ‘Cube,’ a room with smart walls,” says Vänttinen. “A person can use huge touch screens to transform the room into almost anything through 3D virtual reality. Artists are already planning to use the Cube for digital immersive art exhibitions, and medical students would like to study surgery there, using it as a virtual operating room.”<p><p>Even the book logistics are highly innovative. When a borrower returns a book, the system scans it, then a self-guided vehicle transports it through the library, placing it by the correct bookcase for the librarians to reshelve.<p><p>On one side of Oodi, the curved perimeter of the windows frames the nearby buildings of Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art (left), Parliament (centre) and the Music Centre (right).Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>Oodi is part of HelMet (short for Helsinki Metropolitan Area Libraries), a library platform covering the capital-region cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kaunianen. Each one owns its own assets and data, but they are shared in HelMet. A resident of one city can request a book from a library in one of the other municipalities and receive delivery at her nearest branch.<p><p>In a way, Oodi is simply one of the 37 libraries in Helsinki. Yet it is also unique. Oodi possesses its own branding and website, and is considered a separate administrative division within the system. Its dramatic location also sets it apart: in the heart of Helsinki, it forms part of a constellation that includes Finlandia Hall, Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Parliament, the Music Centre, the Central Railway Station and Sanoma House, home of Finland’s largest daily paper.<p><p>Vänttinen says Oodi is already receiving enormous international visibility thanks to its location and size. At the time of writing, the Helsinki library system gets 6.3 million visitors annually; for Oodi’s first year the projected total for Helsinki is eight million, with Oodi itself reaching about 2.5 million.<p><p>The third floor of Oodi, here in the process of being stocked with books before the grand opening, is the part that most resembles a traditional library.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>“Oodi does have a special role as a flagship library,” says Vänttinen. “It is a huge architectural phenomenon in a symbolic location. It also has a special duty to interact with society – not just residents, but also tourists. People might come from far away to experience this building, and it will be their starting point for getting to know libraries in Finland.”<p><p>A patron can borrow books, movies, audio files, musical instruments or specialised machinery at Oodi. However, it can also play an important role in modern society by bringing people together, creating interactions and making things happen.<p><p>“I’m confident that Oodi will be the most popular meeting place because of its nature as a free space, open seven days a week, centrally located and convenient in all kinds of Finnish weather conditions,” Vänttinen says. “It is simply easiest to say ‘Let’s meet at Oodi.’”<p><p>By David J.

The next edition will be presented in autumn 2019; from October 25 to December 31, 2018, anyone anywhere can go online and submit a suggested recipient.<p><p>The Government of Finland awards the prize based on the recommendation of an independent jury, which considers the nominations people submit.<p><p>The organisers are looking for “a distinguished builder and defender of equality.” It can be a person or organisation anywhere in the world. What matters is their work to “advance gender equality and its impact.” The winner does not actually get the prize money, which totals 300,000 euros, double the amount of the original edition of the award. Instead, they choose “a cause, an innovative endeavour or action that promotes gender equality” to receive the sum.<p><p>Mariama Moussa travelled to Tampere, Finland to accept the International Gender Equality Prize money for SOS Femmes et Enfants Victimes de Violence Familiale (SOS Women and Children Victims of Domestic Violence), the nongovernmental organisation in Niger selected by prize winner Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany.

Finnish people have considered gender equality a guiding principle ever since.<p><p>Work still remains to be done, but Finland has repeatedly placed in the top two or three in studies and rankings that measure gender equality and women’s wellbeing. It is usually joined at the top by other Nordic countries.

You can also estimate how many people have been affected by the activities of the person or organisation.<p><p>The inaugural International Gender Equality Prize went to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. Her life’s work has made her one of the world’s most influential people and an example to many women and girls.

{"title": "Finnish baking tradition combines cinnamon, cardamom, sugar and love - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-baking-tradition-combines-cinnamon-cardamom-sugar-and-love/", "review": "", "content": "<p>We’re going to throw three big words at you, one of them in Finnish: ubiquitous, quintessential and korvapuusti. The latter is the Finns’ term for their own special cinnamon bun, flavoured with a dash of cardamom.<p><p>“Ubiquitous” and “quintessential” are labels that travel bloggers love to use when describing the korvapuusti (known as an örfil in Swedish, also an official language in Finland). The choice of adjectives indicates that the tasty pastry is, like coffee, ever-present and vital in Finland.<p><p>It’s so popular that pretty much every bag of flour in the supermarket has a korvapuusti recipe printed on it. Finnish households often make them from scratch as a sweet bite for the weekend. (We list one of our favourite recipe links at the end of this article.) For those unexpected guests, stores also sell frozen versions that can be popped in the oven, filling the house with the same divine fresh-baked scent.<p><p>According to professional bakers, the secret to the perfect korvapuusti is using enough sugar and butter. Sprinkling large crystals of nib sugar (also called pearl sugar) on top puts the finishing touches on the pastry.<p><p>This batch of korvapuusti at Helsinki Homemade is rolled into a rather unconventional shape.Photo: Mari Storpellinen<p><p>Funnily enough, both “korvapuusti” and “örfil” literally mean a slap or cuff on the ear. Why does a beloved bun have such a seemingly negative name?<p><p>“The name comes from the usual form of the pastry, which resembles two diametrically placed ears,” says Arja Hopsu-Neuvonen, development manager at Martat, a Finnish home economics organisation founded in 1899.<p><p>There are other variations of korvapuusti, though, where the ear shape has been abandoned but the ingredients and the craftsmanship remain the same.<p><p>“Korvapuusti can be enjoyed also in the form of cake,” says Thomas Backman, owner of Café Succès in the central Helsinki neighbourhood of Ullanlinna. He says they also sell a korvapuusti rusk, which is a hardened, cookie-like snack. “We are looking into growing our selection of korvapuusti byproducts, since korvapuusti is our bestseller.” Their korvapuusti is a favourite among Helsinkians, and is renowned for being larger than the average.<p><p>Another popular spot for korvapuusti fans is Helsinki Homemade, an artisan bakery in the Töölö neighbourhood. It relies on the old Finnish tradition of serving freshly ground filter coffee out of coffee cups with saucers. The lucky locals tell of how luxurious it is to wake up to the smell of freshly baked korvapuusti.<p><p>“The special ingredient of the korvapuusti is love,” says Klaus Ittonen, pulling no punches to play on our heartstrings. He’s Helsinki Homemade’s cofounder and baker. He started off selling korvapuusti and Karelian pies to tourists off his bike before founding the bakery together with Kátia Corrêa.<p><p>“The korvapuusti needs to be made with love in order to get it right,” says Ittonen. “It sounds a bit silly but that’s the way it is.”<p><p>The origins of the korvapuusti can be traced to at least the 1800s.Photo: Taru Rantala/Vastavalo/Visit Finland<p><p>Versions of the korvapuusti have been delighting Finnish taste buds since the 18th century.<p><p>“Wheat pastries arrived in Finland from Germany via Sweden in the 18th century, but were available only to the upper class at first,” says Hopsu-Neuvonen. “By the end of the 19th century, the korvapuusti had reached the kitchens of the common people, too.”<p><p>Still, the process was gradual: “It became really popular only after the Second World War, when the ingredients became more readily available.”<p><p>Once the korvapuusti had made its way into the mouths of all Finns, there was no stopping it from becoming a firm national favourite. Since the mid-2000s, the pastry has had its own official Korvapuusti Day (Cinnamon Bun Day), celebrated on October 4.<p><p>The Finnish language has a special term for coffee and bun: “pullakahvit” (literally “bun coffee”); Klaus Ittonen of Helsinki Homemade loves the word.Photo: Mari Storpellinen<p><p>For those interested in learning the art of making the korvapuusti, Helsinki Homemade organises baking workshops. Ittonen is keen on spreading the word about this Finnish delicacy. Get ready for another Finnish vocabulary word.<p><p>“Pullakahvit is the most beautiful word in the world,” says Ittonen, using the Finnish term that means coffee enjoyed with a sweet bun (literally “bun coffee”). In many instances, that bun is a korvapuusti.<p><p>That’s right: the Finns love their coffee and korvapuusti so much that there is actually a special word for it.<p><p>Being truly passionate about what he does, Ittonen holds a rather philosophical view of pullakahvit:<p><p>“It’s the highlight of the day, an enjoyment that brings back memories from people’s childhoods. It is not a time for counting calories. Good coffee paired with a homemade korvapuusti makes the world a better place.”<p><p>Several places in Helsinki offer vegan variants of the korvapuusti, too. One of them is Bergga, a café located at the top of a hill in the Kallio neighbourhood.<p><p>“The milk can be replaced with oat milk, or just plain water, and the butter with vegetable margarine,” says Arja Hopsu-Neuvonen of the Finnish home economics organisation Martat. Instead of brushing the top of the korvapuusti with egg mixture before baking, you can use a finish of melted margarine.<p><p>By Mari Storpellinen, September 2018<p><p>In love with a pastry<p><p>Long-term favourite<p><p>Making the world a better place<p><p>Vegan views<p>", "time": "2018-09-26T06:55:18+00:00", "type": "life"}

They look like miniature versions of the adult festivalgoers, except that many of them are wearing noise-cancelling earmuffs and holding balloons. More kids than adults are wearing rubber boots and caps. Some kids even sport outfits that match those of their parents.<p><p>Family Sunday at Flow Festival in Helsinki is in full swing. Kids and their parents are hanging out and enjoying the events.<p><p>Adults with festival tickets can bring children who are ten years old or younger to Flow on Sunday from 1 pm to 5 pm. Aimed at preschoolers, the offerings include a disco, a textile art workshop, enormous soap bubbles, hair braiding, skateboard lessons, glittery makeup, kids’ yoga, movies and DJs.<p><p>Flow Festival Family Sunday began in 2009 with children’s concerts and DJs, and the programme has expanded over the years to include workshops like this one, where children could make gigantic soap bubbles.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>The Flow family programme started in 2009, when the organisers themselves and their friends started having kids. “We wanted to give festival regulars an opportunity to bring their kids here on Sunday,” Flow Festival managing director Suvi Kallio says. “It was only a small addition to the programme. And when you bring the kids with you [for the afternoon], you only need to find a babysitter for the evening.”<p><p>At first Family Sunday just included bands and DJs playing children’s music at the outside venue Backyard, but it has expanded over the years, with approximately 500 children attending (Flow’s total attendance for the whole weekend was 84,000 in 2018). According to Kallio, the Skidit Mega Disko [skidit means “kids” in Finnish], which debuted in 2017, is one of the children’s favourites.<p><p>Skidit Mega Disko is popular with kids and parents. The disco takes place in a former boiler hall.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>The renowned Finnish DJ Orkidea is playing cheerful tunes in a 1,000-square-metre former boiler hall. Spotlights illuminate entertainers dressed up as characters from children’s stories. Parking space for strollers is located in one corner, and couches for children – and their tired parents – in another.<p><p>There seem to be almost as many adults as kids on the dancefloor. The Skidit Mega Disko really is popular, as is the other dance event at Backyard, where DJs are playing more traditional children’s music.<p><p>Oliver and Verner, three and five years old at the time of writing, are at Flow Family Sunday with their dad and mom, Visa and Johanna, for the second time. “Festivals are a part of Finnish summer culture, and we thought it would be nice for the kids to experience this atmosphere, especially since there is a special programme for them,” says Visa.<p><p>The boys’ favourite isn’t actually part of the kids’ programme, though. It’s the concert of the Finnish R&amp;B artist Stig Dogg. After the Skidit Mega Disko the boys head home with their grandmother, while the parents stay to enjoy the rest of the festival.<p><p>Kids at Flow Festival take part in a textile art workshop organised by Aalto University. The separate patches from the workshop were later combined into a large communal artwork.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Ksenia came to Family Sunday with her kids Sofia, 8, and Tigran, 6, and one of their friends. They took part in a textile art workshop organised by Aalto University. Ksenia says she’s been coming to Flow Festival for years, but this is her first time there with the kids. “Our kids have always been curious about it, and they’ve seen the festival grounds from outside, so it was nice to finally show them what it’s about,” she says.<p><p>Family Sunday takes place before the evening influx of festivalgoers. “Of course music is the most interesting thing at Flow, but it’s also fun to wander around the festival grounds when it’s not so crowded, says Ksenia. “And there are lots of interesting workshops here, so the kids can actually learn something new.”<p><p>Sofia adds her opinion to the mix: “I liked blowing soap bubbles and doing the patchwork art, but I also want to get something to eat.”<p><p>Music, dancing, ice cream and the skatepark seemed to be the kids’ favourites. Skateboard lessons had to be discontinued after a brief rain shower passed over the festival, because the ground was too slippery, but the children didn’t seem to mind too much. They enjoyed running around the area, even without skateboards.<p><p>It’s also worth noting that, while Flow welcomes children on Family Sunday, at least three Finnish festivals provide free entrance for music fans on the other end of the age spectrum: Ilosaarirock in the eastern city of Joensuu and Tuska Open Air Heavy Metal in Helsinki (for those over 65 years old), and Ruisrock in the southwestern city of Turku (over 70).<p><p>By Anna Ruohonen, August 2018<p><p>Raising new generations of festivalgoers<p><p>Afternoon disco for kids and adults<p><p>Fun, educational workshops<p>", "time": "2018-08-21T07:32:46+00:00", "type": "life"}

Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Niinistö received the preliminary inquiry from officials of both countries about a meeting in Helsinki just a few weeks before the actual meeting date of July 16, 2018. Even on such short notice, Finland was able to swing quickly into action, harnessing their talkoohenki, a Finnish word that implies both team spirit and everyone chipping in.<p><p>“One of the reasons for holding the meeting in Helsinki is the fact that Finland has a reputation as a well-organised country where everything works,” says Meira Pappi, country branding expert at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland [which also produces ThisisFINLAND]. “People know that we are able to put something of this scale together in such a short time.”<p><p>Media representatives visiting the press centre found the same sort of efficiency. “We wanted to live up to our ranking as the happiest country in the world and make the working experience fun, as well,” says Pappi.

Demonstrations took place on Sunday, July 15 and on the day of the meeting, Monday, July 16. The biggest one belonged to Helsinki Calling, a coalition of concerned citizens representing all shades of the political spectrum.<p><p>“We’re a very broad network of academics, journalists, civil society and others that has come together to talk about issues that Trump and Putin choose not to address,” says University of Helsinki lecturer and Helsinki Calling activist Nely Keinänen.<p><p>Those issues include human rights, press freedom and the environment. “For me the turning point came with the election of President Trump, whom I have been watching with both fascination and fury,” says Keinänen. “I don’t agree with anything he says or does. When we heard he was coming here I thought, now I have the opportunity to make my voice heard.”<p><p>Viima Lampinen, chair of Seta, Finland’s advocacy organisation for LGBTI rights, and a speaker at the Helsinki Calling march, makes it clear that the focus was on both leaders: “We needed to show solidarity with the people who have been harmed by the politics that the two leaders represent.

At the end of the day the Finnish president talked to reporters who were still trying to sort out what Trump and Putin had said at their press conference.<p><p>“The main message from Helsinki seems to be that those two leaders are prepared to continue their discussion on several different difficult issues,” said Niinistö. “And if that is the case, well, then I consider it as a positive. We all have been pointing out that, in spite of everything, dialogue is needed.<p><p>“Now there’s dialogue. I hope that it continues, and hope that they also find some answers to those difficult questions put forward today.”<p><p>“The significance this time is that the Finnish situation in global and regional affairs is quite different,” says Suvi Kansikas, researcher at Helsinki University’s Centre for European Studies, when we speak to her a few days before the American and Russian presidents arrive in Helsinki. “Finland has been part of the EU since 1995, so it can no longer be described as neutral, although it is militarily non-aligned. It is no longer so much a mediator between East and West. The world has also changed since the last meeting in 1997, and our President might now have the opportunity to address the issues that Finland is interested in, for example, regional Arctic and Baltic issues.”<p><p>Kansikas sees the meeting as an exercise in regular diplomacy, and although she does not count out the possibility of some announcements, neither does she expect any major decisions to be made this time in Helsinki.<p><p>“From a European perspective, I think it’s good that the meeting is being held in the EU, since Europe can be included on the agenda,” she says, adding that Finland’s political stability made Helsinki a natural choice for the venue. “Finland maintains a good knowledge of Russia and Finns travel there often, and there is a constant stress on needing to maintain a dialogue with Russia. But you would need to look hard to find the kind of East-West dichotomy that was found in Finnish politics during the Cold War.”<p><p>By Tim Bird, July 2018<p><p>Demonstrative citizens<p><p>Talking dialogue<p><p>An exercise in diplomacy<p>", "time": "2018-07-16T19:29:49+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "A Finn in America ponders the luxury of enjoying life - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/a-finn-in-america-ponders-the-luxury-of-enjoying-life/", "review": "", "content": "<p>When an American friend of mine moved from New York City to Helsinki, he knew what to expect. He had visited Finland often, he enjoyed Helsinki’s manageable size, and he knew that the winters can be tough. Yet there was one thing that worried him: the low level of Finnish salaries.<p><p>The annual median wage for full-time workers in Finland is only 36,000 euros (about 43,000 dollars). This might not seem low in many places in the world, but for an educated professional hailing from one of the world’s big financial centres, it means a serious pay cut. My friend was used to salaries in New York City, and while New York certainly has its share of minimum-wage workers earning much less, corporate professionals such as lawyers, financiers and sales executives usually make at least 100,000 dollars a year. Finnish salaries can’t really compete. Yet my friend from New York soon discovered that the income loss was less dire than he’d expected. The reason was simple: in Finland, he didn’t spend any money.<p><p>He laughed as he said this. Of course, he did have to spend some money. Housing in Helsinki can be absurdly expensive, and food is costly compared to many other places. But there was a deeper truth to what he was saying.<p><p>For example, in New York City the average annual cost of childcare for an infant is 16,000 dollars. That’s above-average for the US, but in more than half of American states, the cost still tops 10,000 dollars, and in Washington, DC, it’s even higher, at 22,000 dollars. In Finland, every child in the entire country is guaranteed a spot in a high-quality, public daycare centre, where children play outside most of the day supervised by expertly trained and well-educated staff. Families pay for this service on a sliding scale according to their income. The maximum amount anyone – no matter how wealthy – has to pay comes to 3,480 euros (approximately 4,100 dollars) per year.<p><p>In the US, new parents must not only pay for expensive daycare, but must also start saving for the future education of their child. Average tuition fees plus room and board at a private nonprofit four-year college in the US will come to about 45,000 dollars a year. In Finland, a university education is free of charge for all Finnish and EU citizens, and the government grants students a monthly stipend to help with living costs.<p><p>In the US, healthcare is one of the biggest expenses for families. In Finland, healthcare is funded through taxes, with patients paying only small contributions. Care for children and pregnant women is mostly free. Annual out-of-pocket costs are capped at 690 euros (815 dollars) per year. Once a patient reaches that limit, most care is free.<p><p>My friend was discovering that, while educated Americans may earn salaries that appear high at first glance, securing these basic services can cost an American family tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of extra dollars per year in after-tax money. In a country like Finland, such services are just like the fire department; you pay your taxes and you’re done. Finnish taxes are proportional to income, and income tax also tends to be lower than most outsiders assume. (A Finnish median wage earner can expect to pay about a quarter of their income in taxes.) As a result, even a seemingly small salary in Finland will take you far.<p><p>People around the world have fallen in love lately with a Nordic ideal that is often referred to by the Danish term hygge – spending cosy time with family and friends, and not working yourself to death in pursuit of higher salaries. [Editor’s note: Even more recently, the Finnish word sisu has been attracting renewed attention abroad.] It is often left unsaid that Nordic people can afford to enjoy their lives this way because their societies have chosen to provide some of the more complicated, expensive, and essential needs of life – daycare, education, healthcare, and the like – as universal goods. This means that people don’t have to spend their own time researching and securing such services, and everyone can receive these basic goods regardless of their income level. It also means the same services are used by the wealthy and the middle-class alike, which helps keep quality high.<p><p>Now that my friend is settled in Finland with a job and a new-born child, he considers it a great deal. It’s not about how much money you make. It’s about what that money will buy you.<p><p>By Anu Partanen, ThisisFINLAND Magazine 2018<p><p>Falling in love with Nordic ideals<p><p>Top three things that work great in Finland<p>", "time": "2018-07-04T06:54:13+00:00", "type": "life"}

And we don’t mean Finnish rye bread – we want them to take the conversation to the next level. Their stories are entertaining and revealing.<p><p>Paula Vilén works as US correspondent for Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, in Washington, DC.<p><p>Paula Vilén prepares for a live radio report in a press booth at the UN General Assembly in New York.Photo courtesy of Paula Vilén<p><p>From the US, I’d definitely bring back to Finland the effortless friendliness of Americans. It makes your life so much more pleasant when you are greeted with a smile and can get into discussions with random people at the bus stop or in the cafeteria. Of course, this makes the USA a paradise for a journalist who is willing to speak with as many Americans as possible about all kinds of topics.<p><p>American DNA includes an ability to make everyday encounters with one another easy and happy. They use the words “hi,” “thank you” and “excuse me” frequently, and they truly have a special skill or gene for remembering your name and using it when talking to you. This makes you feel special and welcome. Some might claim all this is artificial, but even if it was, I’d absolutely prefer that over unsmiling indifference.<p><p>The best gift Finland would have to give to the US would easily be the way of getting things done in an efficient, organised manner. A Finn has a hard time understanding why some plain and simple things, such as registering your car, can require so much time and bureaucracy. In Finland you’d probably find a way to do it online, and that would be that.<p><p>And for all American women and families, I’d hope the US would follow a path more like that of Finland when it comes to maternity and parental leave policies. American women’s jaws drop when I tell them about Finland’s generous maternity leave policies. American society, which values families and loves kids, contains a strange discrepancy in not addressing families’ needs better.

They creatively meander through challenging situations by always “finding a way,” as the Brazilian expression goes.<p><p>The Portuguese word they use for this is jeito, or “way,” also used in the diminutive jeitinho. The trait is both attractive and dangerous.<p><p>Attractive, because belief in finding a solution renders Brazilians eternal optimists. Despite their heavy but humorous self-irony, they are easy to socialise with.<p><p>Dangerous, because the attitude easily becomes a breeding ground for graft.<p><p>Lately, Brazil has been associated more often with a culture of corruption than with the delightful optimism of its people. The latter trait could, however, help us somewhat serious Finns to see the world as a jollier place. Optimism boosts creativity and guarantees success in social situations, something that could help melt a certain Finnish tendency toward inflexibility.<p><p>Thankfully, the Brazilian positive attitude is contagious. When I arrive home from Brazil, the attitude stays with me for some time, until the winter brings a touch of melancholy. However, that pensiveness can also feel cosy during the cold Finnish winter.<p><p>Back in Brazil, there are moments when one feels especially nostalgic about the Finnish way of life. One such instant is crossing the street. The kind of courtesy one receives from Finnish drivers is absent.<p><p>A Finnish lady who lived in Brazil at the same time as I did once analysed Brazilian culture according to the way people drive, and drew some interesting conclusions. Brazilians are polite as long as there is face-to-face contact. Behind the windscreen or on the phone, they shed their social skills, she argued.<p><p>A bit of Finnish patience and sense of responsibility could make life more enjoyable for pedestrians while helping curb rampant traffic accidents in a country where the car is king.<p><p>Katriina Pajari is the Beijing-based China and Asia correspondent for Helsingin Sanomat, Finland’s largest daily.<p><p>Katriina Pajari pauses to pose in Shanghai.Photo: Toni Rosvall<p><p>Here’s a thought that I have almost every day: If only Chinese people knew how to line up like Finnish people do.<p><p>I’m exaggerating to make a point, of course. China has people who know how to form a queue, and there are Finns who don’t. But still, I bet I could get rich by importing and commercialising the skill of lining up to China.<p><p>It’s not just about standing in line. We Finns seem to come preprogrammed with some sort of orderliness, and Chinese people seem to be the exact opposite.<p><p>In China, it’s survival of the fittest, whether you’re queueing at the bank, the fruit counter, the restroom or the security check at the airport. If there’s any kind of gap in front of you, even if it wouldn’t be considered a gap at all in Finland, several people will try to slip in.<p><p>In a Finnish swimming pool, people swim up the right-hand side of the lane. Here in China, there will be someone swimming on the right, someone else on the left, somebody swimming crosswise over the lanes, and one person just floating in the middle.<p><p>When I went to the bank, I got up early so I wouldn’t have to stand in line. I was the first one at the door but by the time I took a queue number I was 17th, having been outmanoeuvred by the locals. I really don’t know what happened.<p><p>I don’t think people mean any harm when they cut in front of others – I don’t even think they realise they’re doing it. They’re used to dealing with enormous numbers of people, where you have to be determined and look out for yourself.<p><p>But the Finns could learn something from Chinese people about how to keep their cool in a crowd without becoming claustrophobic. And how to dance in a park, sleep on a parked moped, or strike up a conversation with someone’s kids. Those are the things I love about China.<p><p>Iida Tikka reports international news for Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company.<p><p>Drawn back to Russia again and again: Iida Tikka covered the visit of Finnish President Sauli Niinistö to the Arctic Forum in Arkhangelsk, Russia in early 2017.Photo courtesy of Iida Tikka<p><p>Over the past four years, I have lived on and off in Russia, first studying, then working as a journalist. Every time I move away, I somehow end up returning, even if life in Russia is not always tak prosto (so easy), especially for a journalist. It means battling it out with bureaucrats, learning how to quickly redo all your plans when an obstacle appears, and learning how to keep going with little or no sleep for days at a time.<p><p>Still, Russia draws me in.<p><p>The reason is very simple: Russia breathes a spontaneity that Finland cannot offer. When in Russia, you truly cannot know what might happen during a day. You could end up in the kitchen of a stranger with a random group of people discussing the cultural policies of the Soviet Union, or in a cabin outside the city in the sauna of your friend’s grandparents – basically whatever.<p><p>The possibility of unforeseeable spontaneity on a day-to-day basis is something that I’d like to bring from Russia to Finland, the country where some of my friends suggest using Doodle (an app for finding the best time for a meeting) just to book a time for a cup of coffee.<p><p>Ironically enough, what Russia lacks and Finland has is the ability to plan. It affects everything, for example how cities are built. I have visited cities in Russia where suburbs have been built in the middle of nowhere and there has been no plan for how they should be connected to the city. And don’t get me started on the stairways in many buildings, where something as simple as building a staircase with even steps has proven to be a seemingly impossible task. With just a little bit of planning, many of these infrastructural problems could and should have been resolved.<p><p>So the Finnish mind-set, where everything is well planned from start to finish, is definitely something I would bring from Finland to Russia.<p><p>Heidi Liekola is a reporter and editor (TV, web, social) with the Swedish public service broadcasting group in Stockholm.<p><p>Camera in place: Heidi Liekola gets ready to record.Photo courtesy of Heidi Liekola<p><p>It’s been 20 years since I left Finland for Sweden, the beloved and, at the same time, insufferable neighbour. At first sight, Sweden and Finland are quite similar. But after a while you start missing many things that the one-hour flight or overnight boat trip between the countries can’t bring from Finland to Sweden.<p><p>One of them is the Finnish do-it-yourself mentality. To me, that means creativity combined with tradition and social context. It’s as simple as it gets – it’s about taking care of your stuff instead of buying new stuff or acquiring the latest things just because everybody else has them.<p><p>Finnish DIY is also about being what you want to be. It’s individuality. It’s the courage to follow your own path. It’s also about quirkiness. I mean, who else but a Finn could come up with the DIY idea of making your own salmiakki liquorice vodka? It’s about doing great things without making a fuss about it.<p><p>Actually, though, Finnish people should make a fuss about it, and about themselves. Nowadays it’s starting to happen. But still, this is the part where Finland should consider importing the Swedish mentality of collaboration in order to succeed.<p><p>When the sourdough trend was at its hottest in Stockholm and there were bakeries rising up all over the place, one of them started offering a sourdough hotel for all the home bakers. The media picked it up: People could leave their sourdough starter there for safekeeping while on vacation, and the bakery got publicity. Success brings more success, and the Swedes have the ability to collaborate to achieve it.<p><p>Here’s something to try: The recipe for taking Finnish DIY ideas to the next level – remember where you read it first – might just be to hire a Swede to “dress them for success.”<p><p>December 2017, updated July 2018<p><p> <p><p>Effortless friendliness<p><p>Different skill sets<p><p>Lifelines<p><p>Spontaneity isn’t so easy<p><p>DIY creativity<p>", "time": "2018-06-20T07:10:36+00:00", "type": "life"}

The long-established discord between the two camps meant that, even after independence was achieved, the way ahead for the new nation was unclear.<p><p>The Civil War lasted from January 27 to May 15, 1918. Out of some 36,600 deaths, approximately 9,700 were executions and 13,400 were due to appalling prison camps. Red casualties outnumbered White by around six to one.<p><p>Political reconciliation began almost immediately after the war was over. It would take longer for cultural and social reconciliation to begin.<p><p>The White general, C.G.E. Mannerheim, leads a parade down the Esplanade in Helsinki on May 16, 1918 in honour of the end of the Civil War.Photo: cc by 4.0/Helsinki City Museum<p><p>The White victors had placed their hopes in a monarchy with strong ties to Germany, but that country’s eventual defeat in the First World War put an end to the idea. Finland chose a republican constitution in July 1919.<p><p>“It is hard to talk about republicans being more interested in compromise when many of them supported harsh measures against Red soldiers,” says Jason Lavery, permanent adjunct professor at Helsinki University and professor of history at Oklahoma State University. “Yet, those who wanted a republic saw it as a more inclusive form of government for both the moderate left and monarchists.”<p><p>Finland’s first president, K.J. Ståhlberg, was a believer in reconciliation, pardoning Red prisoners, allowing trade unions to negotiate and signing a law so tenant farmers could purchase their holdings at advantageous prices.<p><p>“Ståhlberg did try to unify the country, but within the parameters set by the anti-Marxist consensus,” says Lavery.<p><p>Helsinki’s island fortress of Suomenlinna, now a Unesco World Heritage site and tourist favourite, was the location of a prison camp holding captives from the Red side in early 1918.Photo: Niilo Toivonen/cc by 4.0/ Finnish Heritage Agency<p><p>The moderate Progressive Party and the Agrarian Union supported compromises and steps towards reconciliation during the early years of independence. The extreme left was excluded from the political process, but the Social Democrats were welcomed in local politics, and even became the largest party in Parliament under the leadership of Väinö Tanner.<p><p>“Tanner did what he could,” Lavery says. “As prime minister in 1927, he accepted the salute of the Civil Guard, the militia that formed much of the White Army, in the annual parade commemorating the end of the war.” The White general, C.G.E. Mannerheim, had begun an annual tradition of a parade on May 16 in honour of the end of the Civil War.<p><p>Tanner’s acceptance of the salute was particularly relevant, because the Civil Guard had been called butchers by the left because of their role in summary executions. When elements of the Civil Guard and a group called the Lapua Movement attempted a right-wing coup, in 1932, the majority of Finns rejected them and the uprising failed within days.<p><p>The late 1930s was a period of relative economic prosperity and continuing social reforms, which helped to contribute to a strong democracy and parliamentary system.<p><p>Miina Sillanpää, who would become known for her ability to get parties with opposing viewpoints to converse, gives a speech as a member of Parliament in 1907.Photo: J. Indursky/cc by 4.0/Finnish Heritage Agency<p><p>Another politician who was influential in forming the future of the country was Miina Sillanpää, known as a bridge-builder who could bring together parties with opposing viewpoints. She was among the first women, 19 of them, voted into Parliament in 1907 after women gained the right to vote and to run for office, in 1906. During the Civil War she worked to help orphaned children, of whom there were many – 15,000 by some estimates.<p><p>In Tanner’s government (December 13, 1926 – December 17, 1927), she held the position of Second Minister of Social Affairs, making her the first female government minister in Finland. She came from a working-class background and helped drive social issues such as better working conditions for maids and other workers, and shelters for orphans and unwed mothers. Tarja Halonen, Finland’s president from 2000 to 2012, has remarked of Sillanpää that she “can be said to be one of the mothers of the welfare state.”<p><p>Sporting heroes, most notably distance runner Paavo Nurmi, also helped all Finns to root for a common goal. He won 12 Olympic medals – nine gold and three silver – over three Olympic Games between 1920 and 1928.<p><p>In the Winter War of 1939–40, recruits from Vihanti, a village about 600 kilometres (375 miles) north of Helsinki, sit during a break in the fighting at Suomussalmi, near the eastern border. The Winter War became the unifying, unambiguous war that the Civil War was not.Photo: cc by 4.0/Finnish Wartime Photo Archive<p><p>In 1939 the Soviet Union attacked Finland, starting what is known as the Winter War, which lasted from November 30, 1939 to March 13, 1940 and united all elements of Finnish society in the defence of their country.<p><p>“The Winter War was the unambiguous and heroic war of national liberation that the Civil War was not,” Lavery says. “It was independent Finland’s first great collective achievement.”<p><p>Organisations representing employers and employees agreed to negotiate and cooperate. The Social Democrats encouraged their members to join the Civil Guard. Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim cancelled the annual parade commemorating the White victory, replacing it with a day of remembrance for the fallen. Finns were willing to unify for a common cause.<p><p>“One must also consider events after the Second World War,” says Lavery. “These include the legalisation of the Finnish Communist Party, the building of the universal welfare state, and the art and scholarship produced about the events of 1918.”<p><p>The Civil War brought destruction to many parts of Finland. In April 1918, only chimneys were left standing in Tammela, an area of the central western city of Tampere.Photo: cc by nd 4.0/Vapriikki Photo Archive/Tampere Museum<p><p>One of the most important literary works related to the Civil War is Väinö Linna’s trilogy Under the North Star, published in 1959, 1960 and 1962. It sympathetically explores the motivations of the Reds and unflinchingly describes what happened in the war’s aftermath.<p><p>It was the cultural reconciliation Finland had long awaited, but the process of reconciliation is never over. “Civil wars often never really end,” says Lavery.<p><p>Even today, Mannerheim remains a divisive figure. “Butcher” is sometimes spray-painted on statues of him, while the Mannerheim Museum uses the loaded term “War of Liberation” to refer to the Civil War.<p><p>A 2016 survey by Finnish national broadcasting company Yle shows how deeply the war affected people. Even nearly a century after Civil War ended, 22 percent of respondents said that it remained a “highly sensitive” topic in their families.<p><p>Yet Finnish society values a process of law, democracy and working together for the common good. This has helped heal, as much as possible, the scars from the Civil War.<p><p>“It took decades to gain full trust in democracy,” said Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö in a speech on January 1, 2018. “Participatory patriotism was born.”<p><p>One lesson that came out of the Civil War, he said, is that “there is diversity, people have different backgrounds, convictions and goals, and we have a right to disagree. This is something we must be able to respect, however differently we ourselves might think.”<p><p>By David J.

May 1 is Labour Day in honour of workers, but for generations Vappu has also been celebrated as a two-day outpouring of festive emotions to mark the arrival of spring. A number of classic foods and drinks are associated with the holiday.<p><p>A Finnish May Day funnel cake, or “tippaleipä,” is a knot of crunchy, golden brown pastry sprinkled with powdered sugar.Photo: Ossi Lehtonen/Lehtikuva<p><p>Finnish May Day funnel cakes are called tippaleipä (literally “drip bread”). You make them by pouring batter through a funnel or pastry bag and frying it in hot oil. The result is a fist-sized knot of crunchy, golden brown pastry which is customarily sprinkled with powdered sugar.<p><p>Every Finnish grocery store carries funnel cakes beginning in mid-April. Some bakeries are proud of their long history of making them: bakery and chocolatier Fazer boasts about having used the same recipe since the 1960s.<p><p>Many Finns prefer to make their own instead of buying the packaged variety. Purists will of course tell you that warm, fresh tippaleipä is the best kind.<p><p>Festive atmosphere: On Vappu, you may meet a bear selling balloons downtown in the southern central Finnish city of Tampere.Photo: Laura Vanzo/Visit Tampere<p><p>Doughnuts are another fried food customarily consumed on May Day. The Finnish version is called munkki. The word means “monk,” and legend has it that the name refers to the similarly brown colour of monastic robes or the round shape of the monks themselves, or both. A munkki is slightly more substantial than the product you’d typically find in a North American doughnut shop.<p><p>Many varieties exist, both yeast doughnuts and cake doughnuts, sometimes filled with jam or covered in sweet icing. However, the time-honoured May Day munkki is a hearty yeast doughnut rolled in sugar right after frying.<p><p>Grocery stores sell doughnuts and smaller doughnut “holes,” but many Finns make them at home. A common practice is to make doughnuts on the morning of May Day so you can bring them with you to an afternoon picnic.<p><p>Mead is an ancient alcoholic beverage created by fermenting honey with water. Finland has its own unique May Day variety called sima. The modern Finnish version generally has very low alcohol content and is made with sugar instead of honey.<p><p>A dozen commercial varieties appear in shops at the same time as boxes of tippaleipä hit the shelves, but all sima has similar characteristics. It’s always golden or light brown, and bubbly from yeast fermentation. The taste contains a hint of lemon and raisins. Old-school versions are unfiltered and slightly cloudy from the yeast.<p><p>Some May Day picnickers go to great lengths, bringing furniture and white tablecloths to the park.Photo: Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva<p><p>The raisins are particularly important if you make your own sima, because as the yeast ferments, tiny bubbles cling to the raisins in the bottle. When the raisins float to the top, you know the sima is ready to drink.<p><p>And lest we be accused of neglecting to mention the obvious: champagne and other sparkling wines also enjoy great popularity on Vappu.<p><p>May Day is characterised by picnics as long as it isn’t raining or snowing – although a significant proportion of committed partyers proceeds to picnic no matter what the weather. And yes, some years do witness snow flurries on May 1, although we can remember many sunny May Days, as well.<p><p>Finns take typical picnic food: meatballs, hotdogs, potato salad, pickled herring and new potatoes. Sometimes they even cook sausages on portable grills in the park. It is not uncommon for people to go to great lengths to make it a special occasion, such as setting up tarps and tables with white tablecloths in Kaivopuisto, Helsinki’s waterside park.<p><p>Despite the variety of food people serve at May Day picnics, from snacks to fine cuisine, the holiday wouldn’t seem complete without the classics: funnel cakes, doughnuts and mead. If you feel adventurous in the kitchen, you can celebrate your own Finnish May Day no matter where you are in the world.<p><p>By David J.

{"title": "Cuisine gets cute – and ugly – for Easter in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/cuisine-gets-cute-ugly-easter-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>They’re both the same colour (brown), and the Finns consider them both Easter delicacies. Mämmi has hundreds of years of history, while Mignon eggs have existed for only about a century and a quarter.<p><p>Manufactured by Finnish confectioner Fazer since 1896, Mignon eggs are easy to love. Although many people nonchalantly refer to them as chocolate eggs, their filling is technically not chocolate – it’s a smooth, milk-free, chocolatey blend of cocoa, almonds and hazelnuts. Mämmi, a pudding-like substance made from rye malt and rye flour, is a food that non-Finns often find more difficult to fall for.<p><p>Fazer likes to say that its Mignon eggs (the word means “cute” in French) are handmade. The company uses real eggshells, filling them with a liquefied cocoa mixture that later solidifies. That’s the part that they do by hand, holding one eggshell at a time under a faucet, a little bit like something you’d see in a movie about Willy Wonka. They also have to pack the eggs manually to avoid cracking them.<p><p>You peel a Mignon like a regular egg, but it contains a solid, chocolatey confection.Photo: Kristiina Hemminki/Fazer<p><p>Legend has it that Tsar Nicholas II was one of the first famous fans of Mignon eggs and made them an Easter tradition at his court in Saint Petersburg. Nowadays Fazer produces more than 1.5 million of them each year, enough to fill 23 transport trucks. For the employees who fill and stack the eggs, the season lasts from November through March.<p><p>In order to eat a Mignon, the customer has to peel it like a hard-boiled egg, revealing a round, solid, chocolatey confection. In one Finnish family we know of, the father used to insist to the kids that Mignon shells were actually made of sugar (they’re not, except for the solid sugar covering the hole used for the filling). He would also eat the shell to prove his point.<p><p>Don’t try that at home, but for anyone who likes to decorate, dye or paint eggs for Easter, Mignons are great: they don’t need to be cooked or emptied, they don’t smell ugly, they keep longer and, we think you’ll agree, they taste better than regular eggs.<p><p>Mämmi has a consistency somewhere between cake batter and cookie dough, and is usually served with cream. Daffodils and budding willow branches are also associated with Easter, as the holiday often happens just as these signs of spring are appearing.Photo: Soili Jussila/Lehtikuva<p><p>The attraction of mämmi is more difficult to explain, but it’s definitely nutritious. Its consistency lies somewhere between cake batter and cookie dough, which sort of suits the name, with its multiple m’s that make it feel like your lips are sticking together. Saying it in Swedish, the country’s other major language (Finland is officially bilingual), produces much the same effect: memma.<p><p>It tastes pleasant, but visually it resembles – there’s really no nice way to put this, so let’s just say it tastes better than it looks. People often pour cream over their mämmi and sprinkle sugar on top, which contributes to the taste but doesn’t improve the appearance.<p><p>A Finnish invention, mämmi is generally available only in Finland and Sweden, which is home to approximately half a million people of Finnish descent, about five percent of that country’s population. One other similar dish exists: samanu, made by a similar process from wheat instead of rye, is associated with Nowruz, the Persian New Year celebration, held every March.<p><p>If you value a connection with history, mämmi offers a tradition that stretches back to at least the 1600s and possibly as far as the 1100s. It is prepared by baking but can be stored cold for many days; this made it a perfect fit for Good Friday, when custom forbade lighting a fire and cooking food.<p><p>Mämmi is also healthy – at least before you add cream and sugar, but even then. It is rich in protein and fibre from the rye; depending on the recipe, it contains approximately five percent protein and eight percent fibre. It also conveys an array of minerals and B vitamins.<p><p>Many brands, varieties and flavours of mämmi appear in Finnish grocery stores; shown here is organic mämmi. Birch-bark patterns often appear in the packaging, alluding to the birch-bark trays that people traditionally used to serve this Easter delicacy.Photo courtesy of Kymppi-Maukkaat <p><p>Multiple brands are available at any store during the Easter season, usually packaged in compact disposable trays holding about 500 grams (a little more than a pound), but any way you present it, it lacks the cuteness factor of chocolate eggs. However, that hasn’t stopped the Finns from getting creative with mämmi in various desserts, main dishes and beverages. Sampling Finnish food blogs and grocery stores, you can find berry mämmi, potato mämmi, coffee mämmi, vanilla mämmi, mämmi-mango dessert platters, mämmi yogurt, mämmi-liquorice ice cream, mämmi cheesecake, mämmi custard buns, mämmi lemon-custard pie, mämmi chocolate cake, mämmi mousse, mämmi-orange parfait and several kinds of mämmi bread, not to mention mämmi cream stout beer.<p><p>You can find Finnish people who can’t stand mämmi, but the majority of them seem to like it – once a year, in any case. For recent arrivals to the country who are experiencing their first Finnish Easter, mämmi represents a kind of rite of passage. You have to taste it first – then you can criticise it, defend it, or just reserve judgement, as the case may be.<p><p>The Finns buy more than 1.7 million kilograms (3.7 million pounds) of mämmi per year, most of it around Eastertime. This means more than a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of mämmi for every Mignon egg sold. How about this: Has anyone tried manufacturing mämmi-filled chocolate eggs? They’d be sure to become a hit in Finland.<p><p>By ThisisFINLAND staff, March 2018<p><p>You can’t eat Fabergé eggs<p><p>Nutritious af<p><p>The many manifestations of mämmi<p>", "time": "2018-03-23T08:31:34+00:00", "type": "life"}

They were unperturbed by the attention.<p><p><p><p>This unboxing video shows items from the 2017 version of the maternity package, which is updated annually based on feedback from parents and according to changing trends. Video: Finland’s Social Insurance Institution (Kela)<p><p>There’s more to the maternity package than fashion statements, though. Every new mother in Finland has the right to this box of baby clothes, care items and accessories to give every child a good start and help parents grow into their new role. The system originated in 1938, when the government introduced a maternity grant with a monetary value, to help address concerns about infant mortality and declining birthrates.<p><p>Then, as now, expecting mothers had to attend a prenatal clinic in order to qualify to receive the incentive, and the medical and educational value of these visits remains closely associated with the maternity package concept. Finland has one of the lowest rates of infant mortality – and of maternal mortality – in the world.<p><p>Today you can choose the maternity package or a cash benefit of 140 euros (170 euros starting June 1, 2018). Approximately 60,000 families receive the package or the money each year. Ninety-five percent of first-time mothers take the maternity package; for subsequent children, almost one-third of mothers opt for the cash instead.<p><p>Luca is wearing this year’s wraparound bodysuit, with whimsical representations of orange cats, blue squirrels, white lambs and green moose overlapping white clouds, together with turquoise footless trousers.Photo: Pauliina Pennanen<p><p>Kela modifies and updates the maternity package annually based on feedback from parents and according to changing trends. For the 2018 version, additions included a pair of wool trousers and a pair of blue and white felt boots. The latter are decorated with an “80” in recognition of the maternity-package tradition’s 80th anniversary.<p><p>Standard items include a snowsuit, mittens, various hats and a blanket that can be zipped up to form a sleeping bag. The selection of winter gear in the box shows that Finns get used to spending time outdoors in the fresh air at an early age, no matter what the temperature is.<p><p>The fabric colours and patterns, and even the illustrations that cover the box, change from year to year, but they’re designed to be gender neutral. Every family gets the same assortment. In 2018, the sleeping bag features pointillism-inspired sheep on a blue-green background; in 2017, blue, pink and yellow owls stood on a grey background; and the 2016 version showed a blue-and-green pattern of bears, berries and conifer trees.<p><p>In addition to the wide variety of apparel – not all of it is winter clothing – the maternity package also contains useful items such as nail scissors, baby’s first toothbrush, a hairbrush and a bath thermometer. A foam mattress covers the bottom of the box, so that the box itself can serve as a safe, clean crib for the new baby.<p><p>Emphasis on environmental sustainability has increased over time, in large part thanks to customer comments. For example, in 2009 Kela stopped including disposable nappies (diapers), which take hundreds of years to decompose and contain harmful chemicals.<p><p>Being a model is hard work: Eetu fell asleep in his mother’s arms before he could actively show off the range of motion in the cotton “jean” overalls included in Finland’s new maternity package.Photo: Pauliina Pennanen<p><p>Kela frequently receives inquiries from other countries that are considering introducing similar programmes. Scotland, Argentina and the US state of New Jersey are experimenting with maternity packages of their own. Kela provides background info about its own programme, but does not make specific recommendations about the contents of the boxes, since local climate and cultural factors affect the choices of what to include.<p><p>Other governments that introduce maternity packages have priorities that are similar to those of the Finnish programme. The main point is to give all children an equal start in life, so the package is designed with their needs in mind.<p><p>The parents-to-be receive a material benefit, but also gain a critical knowledge boost by coming into early contact with healthcare professionals at a time when there’s a lot to learn.

How do they measure happiness?<p><p>Produced by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and carried out by independent researchers, the report takes into account six key variables that “have been found to support wellbeing,” it says. They are income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity.<p><p>Finland jumped from fifth place to displace the previous number one, Norway, which moved to number two.

The International Gender Equality Prize ceremony happened later in the southern central Finnish city of Tampere, on March 6, 2018, in order to place it close to International Women’s Day (March 8).<p><p>This time the prize money totalled 150,000 euros. Merkel decided to contribute the sum to a nongovernmental organisation in Niger called SOS Femmes et Enfants Victimes de Violence Familiale (SOS Women and Children Victims of Domestic Violence, known by its French-language abbreviation SOS FEVVF). The way the prize works, with the winner directing the money to a cause, allows the award to achieve a far-reaching, sustained effect.<p><p>Unable to attend the ceremony and reception in Tampere because of her work obligations, Merkel addressed the assembled guests by video. She called SOS FEVVF a “beacon of hope for women and girls affected by violence.”<p><p>“It is worth the effort – wherever in the world we may be – to work to promote a culture of gender equality,” said German Chancellor Angela Merkel after winning the inaugural International Gender Equality Prize.

The organisation provides support to women and children in distress; strengthens and guides women’s initiatives; and defends the societal rights and freedom of women and children.<p><p>SOS FEVVF president Mariama Moussa travelled to Tampere for the prize ceremony. Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Tampere City Council Chairperson Anna-Kaisa Ikonen were there to greet her. “The issue of fighting violence against women should not be minimised as a women’s issue,” said Moussa in her speech, “but must be recognised as a public-policy issue at the highest level.”<p><p>Her message to women and children victims of domestic violence, she said, was that “this NGO is at their side and justice will never give in.” She spoke of “the need to change social norms and discriminatory attitudes” in society at large. Moussa plans for SOS FEVVF to use the prize money to make a house of refuge for women and girls who are victims of domestic violence.<p><p><p><p>It makes society better and happier for everyone when we build a society that ensures that girls are healthy, independent and respected – this just happens to be the number-one goal of Finland’s development policy, too.<p><p>“This international prize draws attention to the need to promote equality across the globe,” said Merkel. “The political and economic empowerment of women leaves much to be desired in many parts of the world. Yet it is greater empowerment that holds the key to sustainable development.”<p><p>She noted that gender equality forms one of the main goals the international community is pursuing in keeping with the UN Agenda 2030.

Purnauskis is the realm of eight furry felines with names such as Nurri, Micu, Evo, Viiru and Lumi (Snow).

He had been unable to get relief for his troublesome hamstring; three operations in the US had proved unsuccessful.<p><p>The visit to Finland finally allowed the patient to heal, but the doctor’s fee remained unpaid, tied up at the American insurance company because of confusion about the clinic’s location. The surgeon on the case was Orava. He chuckles at the memory. “They are looking at the map,” he says, “and they see Turku is so close to Russia, and they think we belong to Russia.”<p><p>He eventually received his compensation, but the absurdity of the misunderstanding underscored a paradox in modern sports medicine. Star athletes with fans all over the globe receive treatment from a star surgeon who is known only to relatively few people.<p><p>Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie celebrates winning the 2006 Berlin Marathon.

However, everyone who is anyone in big-time athletics knows about Orava. Elite athletes come to Turku to have him repair their bodies.<p><p>One of the world’s leading sports-medicine surgeons, Orava has performed more than 25,000 operations in a career that has included serving as Team Finland’s doctor at four Summer Olympics and 32 years as the national track-and-field squad’s physician.<p><p>Various publications have called him the Dr House of sports medicine for his ability to quickly diagnose and correct problems others cannot detect. His colleagues have been known to marvel at his knack for taking a case that may have remained unfathomable for a long time and figuring out what’s going on. Yet the amiable, modest doctor hasn’t got a hint of self-importance about him.<p><p>Still, “como dios,” like a god, was the way Spanish Olympic runner Marta Dominguez once described Orava and his touch. After Orava repaired David Beckham’s torn Achilles tendon in 2010 in Turku, the renowned soccer player lavishly praised Orava in social media. Middle Eastern sheiks come to him for surgery. In 2010, Serbia sent a private jet to fetch Orava so he could to fix then-President Boris Tadic’s Achilles tendon after he blew it out ago playing pickup basketball.<p><p>Saku Koivu, who saw Sakari Orava for a knee problem, captained the Montreal Canadiens for a decade in the early 2000s.

A champion junior boxer and a judo enthusiast, Orava took his passion for sports with him to medical school at the University of Oulu and saw an opportunity to specialise in Finland’s appetite for sports.<p><p>With Finnish hockey players just beginning to make a place for themselves in the NHL, teams soon discovered that a bright young Finnish doctor who also spoke Swedish, English, German, Italian and Spanish could fix injuries that their money and technology could not mend.<p><p>Some years later, Finnish hockey star Saku Koivu, who happens to come from Turku, flew home to have Orava examine his knee. Koivu was playing for the Montreal Canadiens at the time, and whereas the team physician had been stumped, Orava was able to make a diagnosis and repair the knee.<p><p>Orava expanded his practice by opening clinics in Rome and Barcelona, but now in his early 70s, he no longer sees patients outside his adopted hometown of Turku. He sometimes thinks of retiring, but colleagues ask him to stay because they need his advice and his skilled hands.<p><p>Sakari Orava shows off a couple of the thank-you mementos that he has received from his patients.Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>A testimony to his work, a Real Madrid Champion’s League gold medal he received from the team’s doctors, rests on a shelf in his office. Among various other sports memorabilia is a picture of a squirrel, given to him by an elderly patient because Orava means “squirrel” in Finnish. The patient was unsure if he would appreciate the gift, but he cherishes it almost as much as the medal.<p><p>For all his modesty, Orava sometimes bristles when Finland is not given proper respect as a sports-medicine mecca. The story of the LA triathlete was an example; so are his occasional dealings with American doctors.<p><p>“They said to me, if you were an American and you had invented all those things [in America], you would be a famous, rich man,” Orava says. “But we don’t mind that.

Miska Simanainen, a researcher at the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (often called by its Finnish abbreviation, Kela), points out that the proponents of basic income often claim that it would fit the needs of various self-employed persons, such as freelancers.<p><p>Preventing poverty is not a goal of the experiment.<p><p>“The basic income in itself does not necessarily reduce poverty as much as expected,” Simanainen says. “Reducing poverty depends on the level of the basic income and how other elements of social security are arranged.”<p><p>Kanerva explains that social benefits are already underutilised in the current system, because people do not know they are available.<p><p>“However, the experiment could result in a basic-income–like policy,” he says. “This could include an automatic basic level of support, which would reduce bureaucracy and the intermittent nature of benefits. In other words, the system would combine various benefits, such as business startup allowances and social security funds.”<p><p>The experiment is unrealistic in the sense that the participant gets to keep the entire income, even if they find a full-time job.

To date, I have been interviewed by the BBC, Rai Uno, Tageszeitung and several others.<p><p>The most common question I have been asked has been, “How has the basic-income experiment changed your life?”<p><p>The simple answer is: financially, it has not. The international press seems surprised to learn that Finland already has a system that provides basic financial security to citizens in various life situations. This is not the case in most parts of the world.<p><p>However, for me, being included in this experiment has had very positive psychological effects. I much prefer receiving basic income, rather than dealing with the old system and filling in its complicated forms.<p><p>Earlier, I didn’t accept all small jobs, for fear of losing my benefits and having to reapply for them. Because of the bureaucracy, it was not financially worthwhile to accept all those tiny jobs. I feel much more secure now that short-term jobs no longer reduce my benefits or delay their payment.<p><p>Thanks to the experiment, I have been able to attend events to promote my books, for example. Fees from such events are often very low. Previously, it made no sense to attend library or school seminars. The experiment has lowered my tax rate considerably. Now I say yes to all invitations.<p><p>At the beginning of 2017, I received a grant from the Finnish Cultural Foundation to finalise a non-fiction book, which was published in the spring of 2017. I am currently working on new book projects, but so far I have not received any new grants. I’ve submitted a few articles to publishers, but I can’t invoice them until the articles have been published. In addition, I have sent out dozens of applications in the communications and journalism sector, but haven’t been invited to any interviews so far.<p><p>A basic income alone is not enough to live on. My living expenses total nearly 2,000 euros per month. That’s the amount I need to earn regularly through writing. Usually, an unemployed person can earn 300 euros without losing any unemployment benefits. Once that limit is reached, the take-home pay is 50 percent of the additional income.<p><p>Applying for the adjusted unemployment benefit requires that the applicant reports each and every wage received, which can delay the payment of benefits due to long processing times.<p><p>In the new arrangement, no reporting is required. I can focus on writing and job searches. It feels like the basic income gives you increased freedom and makes society more equal.<p><p>By Tuomas Muraja, ThisisFINLAND Magazine 2018<p><p>Just say yes<p>", "time": "2018-01-22T14:51:36+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Finland expects refreshingly unsurprising presidential election - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finland-expects-refreshingly-unsurprising-presidential-election/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In the presidential election in late January 2018, (with a possible second round in February), Niinistö seems quite certain to be re-elected for a second term.<p><p>At the time of writing in early January, it is somewhat difficult to believe that Finland is holding a presidential election on January 28. Political discussion is tepid, even though the election is close at hand and eight presidential candidates are trying their best to run election campaigns.<p><p>The most common topic of speculation is whether current President Sauli Niinistö will be re-elected directly in the first round, or whether he’ll be forced into a second round against the closest runner-up.<p><p>A second round happens on February 11 if no candidate earns more than half of the vote in the first round. The next six-year presidential term begins on March 1, 2018.<p><p>No one doubts Niinistö’s re-election, as his popularity is exceptionally high. Public opinion polls show a clear majority of voters backing him.<p><p>Pekka Haavisto of the Green Party inspired 37 percent of Finnish voters when running against Niinistö in 2012, and is hoping for a good showing in 2018.Photo: Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva<p><p>This is not merely a passing phenomenon. Niinistö has been Finland’s most popular politician since winning the largest number of votes nationally in the 1995 parliamentary election.<p><p>At 69, Niinistö has had a long political career. He was a Member of Parliament from 1987 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2011. He served as a cabinet minister from 1995 to 2003, including one year as minister of justice and seven as minister of finance. Niinistö chaired the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) from 1994 to 2001.<p><p>In the previous presidential election, in 2012, Niinistö ran as the NCP candidate. It went into a second round, where Niinistö earned 62.6 percent of the vote, while 37.4 percent went to his opponent, Green Party MP Pekka Haavisto.<p><p>Haavisto is running again, with polls showing around 10 percent support, which corresponds to the Green Party’s backing in surveys of overall party support. By contrast, the candidates of two large parties, Centre Party MP Matti Vanhanen and Social Democrat MP Tuula Haatainen, have fallen far short of their own parties’ popularity figures. Also running are Laura Huhtasaari of the populist “Finns” Party, Merja Kyllönen of the Left Alliance, Nils Torvalds of the Swedish People’s Party, and veteran politician Paavo Väyrynen, previously of the Centre Party but running as an independent. Besides Niinistö and Haavisto, the other candidates’ support numbers have mostly remained below 3 percent.<p><p>When a presidential campaign takes place in Finland during December and January, voters don’t have to worry about unseemly baseball caps – toques are the order of the day (these bear the initials of the incumbent).Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>Niinistö chose to run not under the NCP banner, but rather as the candidate of an unaffiliated “citizens’ movement.” Rules require such candidates to collect 20,000 signatures of support; Niinistö’s organisation raked in more than 150,000 signatures over the summer of 2017.<p><p>The president’s former party is backing his candidacy, with NCP activists taking part in the citizens’ movement. Finland’s business leaders are also strongly behind Niinistö. This was revealed in late December 2017, when a list of his largest campaign donors was released. They include Nokia’s former chair, Jorma Ollila, and current chair, Risto Siilasmaa.<p><p>So why was a citizens’ movement launched to support Niinistö? There are three important reasons.<p><p>First, when an incumbent president runs as the candidate of an independent movement, voters find it easier to vote for him or her in the first round.<p><p>Second, as the candidate of such a group, Niinistö is not obliged to take part in domestic political wrangling, which could have weakened his popularity. Niinistö has focused on foreign policy and detached himself almost entirely from the domestic political discussion.<p><p>The third reason was a difference of opinion between Niinistö and the conservative party in which he used to serve, over Finnish membership in NATO. The NCP backs efforts to join the alliance, but Niinistö does not.<p><p>If Niinistö had run on an NCP ticket, he would have had to explain this awkward contradiction.<p><p>You need to keep in mind that only one in five Finns supports applying for NATO membership, according to a public opinion poll in late 2017. In the same survey, three-quarters of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the country’s foreign policy and the actions of the government leadership. The president received good grades; he has focused on leading the way in international relations, as the constitution specifies.<p><p>The eight candidates prepare for a debate in the run-up to the presidential election. In the foreground are hosts Seija Vaaherkumpu (left) and Jan Andersson; the candidates are (from left) Merja Kyllönen (Left Alliance), Sauli Niinistö (incumbent, running as unaffiliated), Laura Huhtasaari (“Finns” Party), Matti Vanhanen (Centre Party), Nils Torvalds (Swedish People’s Party), Tuula Haatainen (Social Democrats), Paavo Väyrynen (Centre Party, running as an independent) and Pekka Haavisto (Green Party).Photo: Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva<p><p>A broad consensus on foreign policy is also noticeable in the presidential campaign debates. The candidates from the largest parties – the Centre’s Vanhanen, the SDP’s Haatainen, and the Greens’ Haavisto, as well as Niinistö – all agree on the most important foreign policy issues. Any differences of opinion are mere nuances.<p><p>Small-group candidates Huhtasaari, Väyrynen and Torvalds have tried to play the role of challengers. Huhtasaari and Väyrynen are EU critics, while Torvalds supports NATO membership. They have not, however, succeeded in taking over the political arena.<p><p>The campaign is likely to heat up before the January 28 election, including tougher election debates among the candidates. That could change the constellation as voters go to the polls.<p><p>What, if anything, could undermine Niinistö’s popularity during the final phase of the campaign?<p><p>Niinistö’s standing could weaken if two things were to happen at once: he would have to fail badly in the final debates, and his rivals would have to simultaneously rack up great successes. Fundamentally it is also a question of whether the people of Finland want the contest to go to two rounds or would rather get it over in round one.<p><p>By Unto Hämäläinen, January 2018<p><p>Incumbent president and seven challengers<p><p>Unaffiliated frontrunner<p><p>Low-key election debates<p>", "time": "2018-01-15T11:40:27+00:00", "type": "life"}

Firmly established among Finnish enthusiasts and still growing, hobbyhorsing is also increasing in popularity in many other countries as young people swing into the saddle.<p><p>“I was out in Helsinki one day when I came upon a hobbyhorse lying discarded on the ground,” says Mariam Nije, 18. “I can’t quite put it into words, but I immediately felt drawn to it. I saw no owner around so I took it home with me. That was 2008, and that’s how hobbyhorses entered my life.” These days, Nije is an active coach and organiser of hobbyhorsing camps and other activities.<p><p>“I have ridden real horses for more than ten years, so I find the world very familiar,” she says. “When I ride dressage, I have a clear picture in my mind of the way a real horse moves, how it extends its legs, and I try to mimic the movements with the utmost accuracy.<p><p>“Initially, what attracted me to the sport was that I like creating things with my hands. When I came across my first hobbyhorse, I tried to duplicate its simple sock-and-stick design. Later, I found the tight-knit hobbyhorse community and I joined in, coaching and organising camps. I love being a coach because I love to contribute and watch my students progress.<p><p>“I enjoy the creativity of hobbyhorsing. The sky is the limit! We share design tips with one another, in person and on Instagram, but everyone really can create whatever they want. Some say I have developed my own, recognisable style: my horses tend to be rather big, with long necks and short manes. I have a very special bond with my horses, and it would break my heart if something were to happen to them.”<p><p>By Tiia Rask, ThisisFINLAND Magazine 2018<p>", "time": "2018-01-10T07:21:06+00:00", "type": "life"}

I guess my father thought it would be a passing trend like the yo-yo, but eventually he bought me a skateboard.”<p><p>Skateboarding turned out to be much more than just a phase. The streets, courtyards and public spaces of Helsinki became the stage where Saario perfected his slides, grinds and kickflips as a teenager. By the time he was in high school, Element Skateboards recognised his talent and invited him to join its European professional team. He travelled the world as a pro skater.<p><p>He also became interested in architecture and art, including environmental art. Today Saario is a qualified landscape architect and a key figure on the global skatepark design scene, with 35 parks to his name in countries including Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands.<p><p><p><p>See action shots filmed at a skatepark Janne Saario designed in the southern Finnish town of Karjaa.<p><p>“I think that a skatepark architect needs to skate for at least eight years before designing,” says Saario, now in his early thirties and a father of two. In addition to his love of skateboarding, which he still does for fun, Saario’s motivation derives from turning urban spaces into parks “where youngsters can express themselves.” There are not many urban spaces designed specifically for young people.<p><p>“Teenagers like to hang out, so the social aspect of skateparks is vital,” he says. “Becoming a parent has also made me think even more about subsequent generations.”<p><p><p><p>Watch the making of Saario’s Street Unit movable skatepark elements, and see people skate them when they’re set up in front of Helsinki’s Ice Hall arena.<p><p>Saario’s skateparks combines concrete with conceptual thinking to create, in his own words, “skateable sculptures.” He describes skateboarding as “radical ballet.”<p><p>Saario currently works on about ten projects a year. One of his recent ventures is Street Unit, a line of movable elements and obstacles that make it easy to set up a skatepark wherever needed. “Skate spaces can also be seasonal or temporary,” he says. The units are made of steel to endure hardcore use and rough weather.<p><p>He has a skatepark under construction in Norway. He’s also working on one in Columbus, Indiana, in the US. Eliel Saarinen and his son Eero Saarinen, both storied Finnish architects, designed a number of buildings in that city, several of which are now National Historic Landmarks.<p><p>“I guess they just like Finnish architects,” says Saario.<p><p>Hanging out on the edge: Felix Fiilin (left) and Ole Meiwes take a break at Micropolis, a skatepark in Helsinki with street elements, green areas and an organically shaped pool.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>Located in the Töölö neighbourhood of Helsinki, Micropolis is a quintessential Saario skatepark. Completed in 2006, it consists of various street elements, green areas and an organically shaped pool. Saario’s design also preserved all the trees in the area. Lawn corridors run through the grounds, so that the hares of Central Park can still roam around.<p><p>Ole Meiwes, an exchange student from Germany, found Micropolis with Skatemap, an app for locating skateparks in Europe.<p><p>“This park is great because you can do almost any trick,” he says. “There’s enough space to manoeuvre.” As a landscape gardener, he appreciates the beauty of Saario’s structures. “I know how difficult it is to build a park like this. It also looks good because there are trees and green all around.”<p><p>Felix Fiilin visits Micropolis almost daily with either a skateboard or a scooter. “It’s near my workplace, so it’s convenient to come here when I finish my shift,” he says.<p><p>For Fiilin, the social aspect of skating is as important as a good skatepark. “I probably wouldn’t be doing this if there was nobody skating with me here,” he says.<p><p>Fiilin learnt to skate in Barcelona, often considered a mecca for skaters. “In Barcelona it’s easier because the weather is better than in Finland,” he says, “but I still think that we need more skateparks here.”<p><p>By Carina Chela, January 2018<p><p>A continuing passion<p><p>Rolling radical ballet<p><p>The view from Micropolis<p>", "time": "2018-01-03T12:03:25+00:00", "type": "life"}

It will be awarded biennially.<p><p>The primary goal of the International Gender Equality Prize is to create further promotion of gender equality across the world. To achieve this aim, the prize is given to “a distinguished defender and builder of equality,” as the organisers phrase it.<p><p>The winner of the award does not receive the prize money (150,000 euros in 2017). Instead, the person identifies an issue or action that advances equality, and the money goes toward that cause.

The ad hoc workshops, tutored by Arts Academy students of dance education and visual arts, included games – a polar bear balancing on shrinking ice, for example – and activities such as comic book creation and a garbage orchestra with instruments made from discarded objects.<p><p>“It was a really mind-opening experience to see the pupils at Pääskyvuori Primary School wake up to the situation of climate change through the arts,” says dance education student Emma Keitilä. “Those art-related workshops actually gave the pupils new ideas to stop global warming and save the polar bears.”<p><p>A student at Pääskyvuori Primary School is absorbed in creating an idea book, one of her class’s Green Actions activities.Photo: Antti Hartikainen/Turku University of Applied Sciences<p><p>Another instance of Green Actions in action is the involvement of Ivalo High School in Finnish Lapland, where English and Swedish teacher Ulla Keskitalo, music teacher Katri Kittilä and arts teacher Rodney Francett have planned and carried out Green Actions activities together with their students.<p><p>The idea of older students mentoring younger ones is important to Green Actions, and in this case 16-year-old high school arts and music students worked with 53 elementary school pupils who are about four years younger.<p><p>“The pupils were divided into two groups: one for music and one for arts,” says Keskitalo. “In music, they were given some nature-related words in English to make their own lyrics and their own music with the help of the older students. Different instruments were used. The comments I heard were really positive – the group worked well and the participants enjoyed themselves.<p><p>“In arts, one big group was divided into smaller groups, which then worked with natural materials such as small willow branches, grass and pinecones to make pieces of art.”<p><p>Green Actions seeks to include and utilise local knowledge wherever the projects happen. “Local and traditional knowledge and journalism are a core focus in Green Actions,” says Yoken.<p><p>“I am inviting a colleague, Inga Hansen, a Greenlandic journalist, to present at our Green Actions workshop and seminar days at the Arts Academy at the end of February 2018. Inga is doing graduate research studies in Kautokeino, Norway at the Sámi University of Applied Sciences graduate programme in Indigenous Journalism.

She spent more than 700 days exploring and photographing the country’s 40 national parks, travelling by foot, ski, skate, snowshoe, canoe, kayak, rowboat and even helicopter. You can see some of the resulting pictures in our slideshow, below.<p><p>Karvinen, whose first name, Tea, is pronounced as two syllables, unlike the English word “tea,” grew up in Helsinki. Despite her city upbringing, she has felt the call of the wild and the call of the far north ever since she was a child. Today she lives in Finnish Lapland, a short distance from the Arctic Circle. In the 1990s she studied photojournalism at the University of Alaska.<p><p>In 2001, while working at a ski resort in the US, she got hooked on skeleton sledding, which involves hurtling down an icy track headfirst on a small open toboggan. She went on to represent Finland at the international level for nine years.<p><p>“Then about ten years ago, when I was sitting out all night alone in a bear-watching shelter in northeast Finland with plenty of time to think, I decided to focus my life on nature photography,” she says. “This eventually led to my project of photographing all of Finland’s national parks.”<p><p>The Northern Lights, Aurora Borealis, dance in the sky – and on the water – in the northeastern national park named after the late Urho Kekkonen, who was president of Finland from 1956 to 1982.

Such beautiful scenes are typical of Finland, which is 70 percent forest and contains 187,888 lakes.

Fire forms a natural agent of change in forest ecosystems and is therefore used in habitat restoration programmes. Photo: Tea Karvinen<p><p>While compiling material for her book, Karvinen met and interviewed more than 150 people who know the parks well, including national park rangers, scientists and local residents with colourful stories to tell. But she also loves to explore the wilds alone.<p><p>“I find this the best way to connect more deeply with nature, and give my full attention to observation and photography,” she says. “Perhaps I’m a bit of a social hermit, since though I like good company, I often need to be alone. Even in the wildest places, I never feel lonely or unsafe.”<p><p>She has nevertheless endured some narrow scrapes during her trips. In Teijo National Park she sank up to her thighs in a bog while shooting rare marsh flowers. In Koli, a huge snow-covered spruce tree suddenly came crashing to the ground just a couple of metres from where she was capturing a snowy scene, fortunately leaving her unharmed. And in Sipoonkorpi, a huge, aggressive mother Ural owl attacked her ornithologist interviewee while he was putting ID rings on two fledgling owlets, whose photo appears in the book.<p><p>Karvinen is reluctant to name her favourite park, but she loves the variety of Finland’s national parks: the wild open arctic fells of the far north; the vast, ancient inland forests; the countless windswept rocky islands of the Baltic archipelagos. “It’s worth visiting them at different times of year,” she says. “I especially love early summer, when everything is fresh and green; autumn when the forests are full of colour and the aurora borealis starts to shine in the northern night sky; and midwinter when the scenery is covered with a blanket of pure white snow.”<p><p>Point your kayak across the lake at Päijänne National Park; it’s a beautiful day to be outdoors in southern Finland.Photo: Tea Karvinen<p><p>She hopes her book will inspire readers to get out into Finland’s national parks and other natural places. “Getting close to nature is good for your physical and mental wellbeing,” she says. “If nature becomes important in people’s lives, this will also encourage them to cherish and preserve our precious natural places.”<p><p>Karvinen feels that Finland’s impressive network of national parks includes plenty of wonderful places for foreign visitors to discover. Though people from other cultures often find large forests scary, she emphasises that there’s nothing to fear if you take care: “For newcomers it’s best to follow trails, or go with a local guide, or a good map, compass and GPS, if you want to get off the beaten track and discover ‘the real Finland,’ away from the cities.”<p><p>By Fran Weaver, September 2017<p><p>The wildest places (slideshow)<p><p>Exploring the real Finland<p>", "time": "2017-10-16T07:50:52+00:00", "type": "life"}

Finnish companies cultivate insect cuisine - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/crunch-cringe-finnish-companies-cultivate-insect-cuisine/", "review": "", "content": "<p>For many people, the ick factor has nothing to do with it. They consider eating insects an environmentally conscious choice.<p><p>Producing one kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of beef requires 22,000 litres (5,800 gallons) of water, including the water used to grow the fodder, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN. Cattle require plenty of space, too.<p><p>As the world population grows exponentially, demand for beef and other meat is also rapidly increasing. Livestock farming is causing a strain on the environment.<p><p>With a protein content of up to 25 percent, crickets are comparable to beef – and much more environmentally friendly, requiring very little water, food and space. Other edible insects include grasshoppers, termites, mealworms, maggots and various kinds of caterpillars and beetles.<p><p>A quick checklist in favour of farming insects, sometimes referred to as “microlivestock,” looks something like this: they’re high in vitamins and minerals, can feed on biowaste, produce remarkably less greenhouse gas emissions, use little water and space, and have a faster breeding and growth cycle.<p><p>At Entocube, Perttu Karjalainen’s crickets live in little boxes. There’s no mooing, neighing or bleating, but the microlivestock does chirp and emit a steady munching noise as it eats.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>On the day we visit an insect tasting event called “Bugs love beer” in the city of Tampere, the tasty dishes win people over: the cherry tomatoes with Indian harissa topped with mealworms and sprouts are delicious, as are the insect “meatballs” made from lentils, carrots, onions and cricket flour. The diners wash down the microlivestock with microbrewery beer.<p><p>“When I hold one of these events, I answer guests’ questions and explain the environmental and economic benefits,” says chef Topi Kairenius. “And then, of course, they get to taste for themselves how delicious these dishes can be.”<p><p>Well known in Finland for his insect cuisine, he actively promotes entomophagy in the media and at well-attended tasting events. His mission is to change the perception of insect eating.<p><p>Eating insects, or entomophagy (from the Greek word for insect, entomo), has been practiced for millennia in many parts of the world.<p><p>With a name based on the same root word, the Finnish company Entocube farms crickets in the Helsinki region, sells cricket-based culinary products and even supplies growing units (actually they look like cabinets) to would-be cricket farmers. CEO Perttu Karjalainen says that the press in Finland actively covers this new industry.<p><p>“The media and public characters like the Madventures guys [Finnish daredevil TV personalities] are critical in presenting insects as interesting and tasty,” he says. “Insect eating has become trendy, and this trend is likely to grow as Finns become more and more environmentally conscious.”<p><p>Santtu Vekkeli, the founder of Nordic Insect Economy, holds out a handful of dried, edible crickets. On the right a copy of “The Insect Cookbook” is visible.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>An online survey conducted in 2016 by the University of Turku asked Finns for their opinions about eating insects. Seventy percent of the participants expressed interest in insect foods, compared to lower results in many other European countries. Less than 40 percent of Swedes were in favour, and the figure was 25 percent in Germany.<p><p>The university participated in a two-year project called “Insects in the food chain,” investigating different aspects of entomophagy in Finland.<p><p>Jaakko Korpela, a project leader at the university’s Functional Foods Forum, explains that “the aim is to encourage new know-how through cooperation between companies and researchers, and to place Finland at the forefront of a new international insect economy field.” Insects as animal feed for fish or chicken forms one of the topics of discussion.<p><p>Santtu Vekkeli founded Nordic Insect Economy in 2014 to address insect food security, processing, and the broader insect economy, including ethical, environmental and social aspects. “We are involved with our own pilot farms in Europe, USA and Asia,” he says, “and with other large-scale production units in all climate zones.” The company website describes him as “the first entrepreneur in insect food in Finland,” and he invents most of the tools and machines needed for the business, which is located in the southeastern Finnish city of Kouvola.<p><p>Topi Kairenius considers it his mission is to change people’s perception of insect eating. At a tasting event, he prepares hors-d’oeuvres consisting of lettuce leaves garnished with berries, fried crickets and slices of melon.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>We’re not sure which term sounds more appetising – “entomophagy” or “eating insects.” In any case, edible insects are at turning point in Finland and the EU.<p><p>“The new Novel Food Regulation will replace the current regulation and will be fully implemented starting January 1, 2018 in all EU member states including Finland,” says Leena Mannonen from the Department for Food and Health of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. “The new ruling clearly covers all insect products.”<p><p>Unclear text in the old regulation allowed a handful of EU countries, including Denmark, to make their own interpretation and begin marketing insect products several years ago. Finland joined their ranks when the ministry suddenly announced in September 2017 that they will allow the production and marketing of food made from insects. This also means that the products are subject to regulation and to food safety requirements.<p><p>Some major food manufacturers in Finland, such as chocolatier and bakery Fazer, have expressed interest in the insect economy. Flour made from ground insects, for instance, can be used in a variety of ways – bread, cookies, “meatballs” and pizzas, to name a few – making it more approachable for consumers.<p><p>dried locusts 200 g (7 oz) plain chocolate 100 g (3.5 oz) raspberries 1 tsp vanilla sugar mint leaves<p><p>1.

Puree the raspberries in a blender. Add vanilla sugar and continue mixing. 3. Fry the locusts for half a minute in oil in a pan. Remove and place on paper towels to drain excess oil. Pierce with toothpicks and dip in melted chocolate sauce. 4. You can sprinkle a bit of salt on them to produce a fantastic salty-sweet contrast.

At this stage, you can season the dough by sprinkling sesame, fennel or flax seeds on top. 4. Slice the dough into pieces of whatever size you prefer (up to 50 pieces on one oven tray). A pizza cutter works well for this. 5. Using a fork, poke small holes in each piece to prevent bubbles from forming. 6.

The skills of his descendants never cease to amaze him.<p><p>When Taito Vesala, 96, started school at the age of six in 1926, in the first year he had two weeks of school in the autumn and another two weeks in the spring, in an ambulatory school. After that, he attended four years of primary school, and there his education ended.<p><p>“Before we were given our school-leaving certificates, the teacher’s niece and I competed on who had the best grades in the class,” Taito recalls. “The teacher very much wanted me to continue to grammar school, since my grades were actually quite good. But my family was poor, so I had to go to work and give the money I earned to my parents.<p><p>“So that was the end of my formal education, and the rest of my learning took place in the school of life.”<p><p>In the 1920s, Finland was a poor, predominantly agricultural country, and had just recently become independent. Taito was the first one in his family to receive formal education.<p><p>When Taito’s great-grandson Tatu Vesala, 10, started school in 2013, he had a minimum of nine years of schooling ahead of him. Tatu, now in the fifth grade, enjoys going to school and dreams of becoming an actor.<p><p>From left: Jarmo Vesala, Taito Vesala, Tatu Vesala and Jari Vesala share certain school experiences. Photo: Arto Wiikari<p><p>The development of the Finnish school system has coincided with the growing up of Taito’s descendants. Each generation has received more education than its predecessors. The Finnish education system has received recognition worldwide. In the PISA study, the joint research programme of the OECD member states, the skills of Finnish schoolchildren have frequently been ranked high.<p><p>International comparison of schools is difficult, but Finland’s good performance in tests is based on a few cornerstones. In Finland, the attitude towards education is positive and education is valued.<p><p>During the first years of the 20th century, only a third of rural children went to school. In the 1921 act on compulsory education, the objective was for all children to learn the primary school syllabus. After the fourth grade, the children who had the financial means and sufficient grades could apply to grammar school.<p><p>Despite his good grades, this opportunity was not within Taito’s reach. At the beginning of his career, he worked in a variety of jobs, ranging from police officer to real estate broker. The career path of his son Jarmo Vesala, 66, has been similar: he just retired from his job as a service station entrepreneur.<p><p>Jarmo’s education began in Helsinki in 1956. The Primary Schools Act was enacted two years after he started school, adding two compulsory study years. Jarmo’s education was that much longer than his father’s had been.<p><p>The Finnish school system was reformed almost completely in the 1970s, when the comprehensive school reform ended the era of the primary and grammar school system. The reform replaced the primary and grammar school system with the nine-year comprehensive school, which consisted of a six-year lower level and a three-year upper level.<p><p>The comprehensive school system was implemented in Finland gradually starting in 1972. This coincided with Jarmo’s son Jari Vesala, 47, starting school.<p><p>The comprehensive school reform was a hot topic at the time, but for Jari, the new school system was the way of learning.<p><p>“For me, the comprehensive school was the only option to receive education,” says Jari.<p><p>Today, a free meal is served to all preschoolers, comprehensive school pupils and upper secondary level students on each of the five school days. Photo: Lehtikuva<p><p>One of the recipes for success in the Finnish school system is the school lunch. In 1948, the act on school meals was enacted, obligating municipalities to provide a free-of-charge lunch in schools on each of the then six school days.<p><p>“In the 1950s, the school meal service was very much like it is today,” Taito’s son Jarmo recalls. “At a certain time, we all got together to have lunch. I was taught at home that you had to finish all food on your plate.”<p><p>“A dish with a bad reputation in my school was meat stew with dill,” Jarmo says. “I was the only one in my class who was ever able to eat all of it.”<p><p>The years have gone by, and meat stew with dill is no longer on the school menu, which has kept up with the changing times and nutritional recommendations. Today, a free meal is served to all pupils on each of the five school days.<p><p>Tatu, a schoolgoer in the 2010s, is happy with the school meals served.<p><p>“Usually the food is quite OK,” says Tatu. “For example, I like ham and potato casserole. The food is tasty and good.”<p><p>Jari, an earth-moving contractor, is also among those who praise school meals.<p><p>“I have good memories of school meals. The food served in schools is still good – in fact, my father Jarmo and I go to a school located near our current earth-moving site to have lunch. The food is reasonably priced, healthy, and really tasty,” Jari says.<p><p>“I can’t help but admire how the school lunch room serves meals to 700 pupils on each school day,” says Jarmo.<p><p>Ever since the day when Taito was in school, the Finnish school system has used a grading scale of 4 to 10, with 10 being the highest grade, to assess pupils’ performance twice per year.<p><p>“I used to be a solid 7,” Jarmo says of his own school years.<p><p>Grades were given based on tests and classroom performance. The only oral test in the 1950s was the singing test, where each student had to stand in front of the class.<p><p>In recent years the grading system changed from numeric grading towards written assessments. Tatu’s assessment was given in letters up until now.<p><p>“For example, I got an A on the big German test last spring.

He himself did not learn any foreign languages in school.<p><p>“And here we have a ten-year-old who speaks both English and German,” exclaims Jarmo.<p><p>Tatu started learning German in fourth grade, and English started when he was halfway through second grade. The new core curriculum enables Tatu to start learning Swedish in sixth grade next year, so after six years in school, he will have studied three languages.<p><p>Balancing the books: Nowadays kids study many school subjects that were not taught generations ago, and paper textbooks are becoming fewer.Photo: Arto Wiikari<p><p>The stories of four generations illustrate that while the basic principle of school has remained unchanged for nearly a century, the school system is also being constantly renewed. A big reform that will shuffle the Finnish school system in the coming years is the new core curriculum. In elementary school it took effect in autumn 2016.<p><p>In the recent years, phenomenon-based learning extending across different subjects has been introduced in schools. Tatu comes directly from school to meet us, from a class-organised travel fair. In the lessons, pupils plan and organise a travel fair, in which they present destinations and cultures of different countries to other classmates.<p><p>“This morning, Tatu left for school carrying our old suitcase, which is bigger than he is,” Jari says. The old suitcase is one of the props for the travel fair.<p><p>Jarmo (left), Taito and Jari Vesala hold old-fashioned learn-to-read books, while ten-year-old Tatu uses a tablet.Photo: Arto Wiikari<p><p>New learning methods also have an impact on the school premises. As the pedagogic focus is shifting from collecting information to learning study skills, classrooms are transformed as well. Previously, the teacher’s desk was located between the pupils and a blackboard, and the pupils were seated in rows of desks. Today, school rooms are open and transformable. The teacher no longer lectures from a podium, due to the use of wireless computers and digitalisation.<p><p>Tatu’s classrooms no longer have blackboards or chalk. There is a digital camera on the teacher’s desk for displaying materials on a smart board. The teacher may also show videos from their computer. At times, the pupils also get to use tablets or computers.<p><p>“For example, when we colour or draw, we can use the tablet to look at models,” Tatu says.<p><p>Information retrieval skills are practised in connection with presentations, which the students give frequently in pairs or as a group.<p><p>Some of the textbooks are now completely electronic. Tatu’s elder brother Leevi Vesala, 14, has been assigned a tablet at school. The majority of learning materials are already electronic.<p><p>“Young people today are quite something,” says 96-year-old Taito.<p><p>“They receive so much information that I can’t help but admire their skills!”<p><p>By Hannele Tavi, ThisisFINLAND Magazine 2017<p><p>A 100-year journey<p><p>There is such a thing as a free lunch<p><p>Assessment without grades<p><p>Versatile learning<p><p>No more blackboards<p>", "time": "2017-09-06T11:13:24+00:00", "type": "life"}

But visitors don’t always realise that the islands are home to a community of some 800 souls.<p><p>Many members of this community, including a diverse collection of artists, musicians, historians and museum curators as well as sailors from the Finnish Naval Academy based here, are drawn by the romance of island life. When the last ferry leaves for the mainland after midnight and the last tourist has deserted for the day, that life goes on behind the windswept windows of the stone apartments and wooden villas. <p><p>“We are newcomers – we’ve only lived here for about 30 years!”Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Suomenlinna is home to some of Finland’s oldest buildings. A handful of properties remain in private ownership on land rented from the Suomenlinna Governing Body. Seija Linnanmäki and her husband Markku Kallio own two of these, residing in one while renovations proceed on the other.<p><p>“We came to live on the islands in 1989 and only got access to running water and an indoor toilet in 1993,” says Seija.<p><p>Expeditions to the mainland are made in pursuit of the couple’s hobby: competitive ballroom dancing. This explains the several dozen trophies lining the top of the bookshelf.<p><p>“We are still very close to Helsinki,” says Markku. “But it’s pretty much like living in the countryside. There are people here who have been living here for many generations. We are newcomers – we’ve only lived here for about 30 years!”<p><p>“I like to share the atmosphere and give people some kind of nostalgic feeling.”Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Petra Tandefelt, owner, collector and manager of the Suomenlinna Toy Museum, is pouring tea in the café adjoining the museum. On the shelf above the counter stands a row of similar samovars, a separate small museum in itself.<p><p>“Running the museum is not just a duty,” she says. “It’s a passion. I like to share the atmosphere and give people some kind of nostalgic feeling. There are more and more visitors, from all over the world. People need comfort and to be told stories, and to go back to their childhood a bit. That idea is important for me.<p><p>“In July when it’s most crowded and busiest, we get plenty of Finnish and foreign visitors. I think it’s important to concentrate on toys with a strong Finnish connection so I can explain some things about Finnish lifestyle to the foreigners.”<p><p>“If you live in a UNESCO site, you have to be ready to share it.”Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>The temperature hovers at about minus 10 Celsius and the air is blue, still, sharp and bitterly chilled. A head emerges from a hole in the ice. Maritime archaeologist Minna Koivikko of the Finnish National Board of Antiquities is completing the inspection of a wreck. Minna’s PhD dealing with Suomenlinna is the first one in Finland in maritime archaeology, so her expertise is second to none.<p><p>“We dive under the ice because in the summer there is so much boat traffic,” she says. “Helsinki is at the mouth of a river (the River Vantaa) so there is a lot of silt that gets stirred up, spoiling visibility. It’s easier to locate a wreck using GPS coordinates, then to make the hole in the ice. In fact, making the hole is the most difficult part.<p><p>“I love living here. The community spirit has grown since I moved here. People look out for each other; we do a lot of things together. There are more visitors, but if you live in a UNESCO World Heritage site, you have to be ready to share it.”<p><p>Mikael Holmström keeps traditional boatbuilding alive.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>A white glow issues from a heated tent close to Suomenlinna’s dry dock. Inside, Mikael Holmström is at work repairing a wooden Norwegian trawler. The only remaining traditional wooden shipwright in Finland, Mikael works a 60-hour week at the dock in winter and in summer.<p><p>“I like to be here at any time, but I am a winter person especially,” he says. “The only problem is it slows down my work because I have to do the snow clearing – nobody pays you for that.<p><p>“It’s close to the city but I could be anywhere. It could just as easily be the remote town of Inari in Lapland, but here I can have my own life and work. It’s not such a long time ago that everyone did their own work for themselves in Finland. But there is no subsidy for this work. That’s one reason why I do this 60 hours a week.”<p><p>“The whole archipelago here settles you,” says Jaakko Vilander. “It allows you to be in your own undisturbed peace.”Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>It is an obvious paradox that one of Helsinki’s most peaceful outposts gained much of its character by being prepared for war. The island of Pikku-Mustasaari remains the site of the Academy of the Finnish Navy. Young conscripts in navy uniforms and academy cadets are frequent passengers on the public ferry. Cadet Chief Petty Officer Jaakko Vilander is one of these.<p><p>“What’s the best thing about living here?” he says. “That’s easy to answer. It’s the views and the serenity. The whole archipelago here settles you; it allows you to be in your own undisturbed peace.<p><p>“This place represents a kind of fantasy of what Finland could be, a small place where people try to look after themselves. It’s like Buddhism or a kind of monasticism. People pull away from society and live in their own quiet compartments. I can live in peace. But we can’t separate ourselves from society because it’s our job to protect it.”<p><p>“I believe in someone’s soul or energy making its presence felt.”Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Suomenlinna’s most westerly island, Länsi-Mustasaari, bears the brunt of the prevailing Baltic winds and the full force of the autumn storms. When the wind gets up here, it whistles through the trees and penetrates the windows of the apartment blocks built to house the officers and soldiers who once guarded the fortress.<p><p>One of those windows belongs to writer and painter Ida Lindström, whose top floor apartment offers glimpses of the lights of Helsinki. Ida is a guardian of Suomenlinna’s stories, of historical anecdotes, and of ghost tales.<p><p>“Do I believe in ghosts?” Ida nods her head softly. “I believe in someone’s soul or energy or whatever you want to call it making its presence felt. Not everyone sees or hears them. I think you’re lucky if you don’t! I don’t see anything, I only hear. Some people are more sensitive than others. Some people see weird things every week.”<p><p>“The tempo here is a little slower than in the city. I like that.”Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Hannu Leidén, musician, producer and sound engineer, is known to Finnish rock audiences as vocalist with Havana Black, big in the late 1980s and early ’90s and occasionally reunited.<p><p>Hannu’s gentle and friendly demeanour belies the full-blooded rock-and-roll growl admired by his fans. He strokes a long grey beard, a gnomic rock-rebel glint in his eye, as we talk in the apartment living room. The beam from the church dome that serves as a lighthouse sweeps above the window as we talk, signalling in Morse the letter H. H for Helsinki, H for Hannu.<p><p>“The tempo here is a little slower than in the city,” he says. I like that. “The presence of the sea is so great, I couldn’t think of moving away from it nowadays. Suomenlinna is a small village. It’s not always ideal and everything has its pros and cons, but if you feel a little sociable you can manage.”<p><p>“I just keep the door open and people can come in easily.”Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Esa Toivanen is waiting at the door of his studio, set back in a courtyard lined with former barracks and storehouses behind the Piper’s Park on Susisaari.<p><p>“I like making things from wood, so I started making pictures from nails,” he says. “I’m not sure where the idea first came from. There have been many people from around the world who say they haven’t seen anything like this anywhere else. I think there must be somewhere. But it’s not so common, this kind of creation.”<p><p>The island community is very artistic. “There are musicians, artists and crafts artisans, a guitar maker, textile artists. I had a previous studio on the second floor, but I have been in this one for three years. I just keep the door open while I’m here and people can come in easily.”<p><p>These texts and photos are part of Tim Bird’s “Suomenlinna – Islands of Light” book and exhibition project.

Finnish people may read in the sauna, hang clothes to dry in the sauna, wash a newborn baby in the sauna, do yoga in the sauna and even cook in the sauna.<p><p>The most common way to prepare food in a sauna is to wrap some sausages in tinfoil and roast them on the sauna stove. Add some garlic or cheese and voilà, dinner cooks itself while you are enjoying the löyly (literally “steam,” but in a wider sense the word stands for the whole feeling and atmosphere of the sauna).<p><p>Author Katariina Vuori (right) originally started cooking meals in the sauna so she could stay near the lakeshore and supervise the kids while they swam.Photo: Vesa Ranta<p><p>Sauna cuisine isn’t a new thing – Finnish people have utilised the sauna stove, with its heated rocks and water basin, in various household chores such as laundry and cooking for as far back as anyone can remember, and then some. Archival information about sauna cooking is sparse, but the Finns are known to have cooked Christmas ham and even school meals in saunas back in the 1940s.<p><p>At that time, most Finns lived in the countryside, a great many still without electricity or running water. The idea was to make the best possible use of the warmth and warm water produced by heating up the sauna.<p><p>As a young girl, Finnish author Katariina Vuori watched her grandmother cook fish, freshly caught from the lake, in the furnace portion of a sauna stove. The idea of an actual book called Saunakeittokirja (Sauna Cookbook, Tammi, 2014) came to her far from home, in the middle of the Indian Ocean on a sailboat in the late 1990s.<p><p>However, it took until 2011, when Vuori was at her summer cottage with her kids, for her to start broadening her sauna cooking perspectives from sausages and smoked bream to cooking and baking nearly every meal in sauna. The reason was practical: her kids loved swimming in the lake and Vuori had to keep an eye on them. So she started cooking in the lakeshore sauna in order to look after her children at the same time.<p><p>A summer favourite: Berries ripen in the Finnish forests and taste great in a sauna-baked pie.Photo: Vesa Ranta<p><p>“You can cook anything in a sauna,” Vuori says, who co-authored the book with Janne Pekkala. “But you have to have a more relaxed attitude than in a normal kitchen. Cooking time varies depending on the sauna, so you have to make sure you keep a constant eye on the food.”<p><p>The stones are at their hottest right after wood is added to the fire, so that is a good time for frying food. Also note the size of the stove: the smaller the stove, the faster it heats up, and the larger the stove, the more moderate and smooth the heat will be.<p><p>“You’ll get to know your stove quickly,” says Vuori. “If you want to start easy, begin with casseroles.”<p><p>There are several things to consider before beginning. The main thing is that the furnace portion works as an oven and the rocks act like a stove. With an electrically heated sauna you have to be extra careful not to spill anything on the rocks. The sauna stove should be flat and large enough for cooking.<p><p>Vuori prefers a wood-heated sauna. A wood-heated water basin works great for cooking vacuum-packed food. And don’t forget the smoke sauna, a Finnish speciality that leaves sauna-goers’ skin with a unique smoky scent; food cooked in a smoke sauna picks up a smoky flavour. Whatever sauna you choose, make sure the stove is hot enough.<p><p>Ready to roast: Fresh corn on the cob, sausages wrapped in bacon, and onions will fill the sauna with savoury aromas.Photo: Vesa Ranta<p><p>As for cooking dishes, make sure that they are flame resistant – ovenproof is not enough. Cast iron is always a sound choice. Use long-sleeved oven mitts when the furnace is open and you’re inserting or removing food.<p><p>If all that sounds like a bit too much, you can always just cook an omelette in the scoop you use to throw water on the stones, if it’s made of metal. Just line it with tinfoil to keep the food from absorbing metallic flavours from the scoop.<p><p>Vuori travelled 6,000 kilometres while researching the sauna cookbook. In addition to presenting recipes, the volume offers detailed looks at 19 different saunas in locations all over Finland.<p><p>“The most memorable saunas we cooked in were that of Finland’s former president, Urho Kekkonen, in Karigasniemi [in the Finnish far north], and an underground sauna made of granite blocks on [the southwestern Finnish island of] Kemiö,” says Vuori.<p><p>By Jonna Pulkkinen, July 2017<p><p>Turning necessity into virtue<p><p>Relaxed attitude<p><p>Nineteen different saunas<p>", "time": "2017-08-09T06:11:52+00:00", "type": "life"}

The elongated wooden shape forms terraces where people can sit and relax. The building consists of two parts: public saunas and a restaurant.<p><p>Traditionally men and women bathe separately, but the owners and architects of Löyly wanted the sauna be a place where people can spend time with their friends, regardless of gender. So, in an unusual policy for a Finnish sauna, bathing suits are required at Löyly. Anu Puustinen and Ville Hara of Avanto Architects, believe that in the future there will be more unisex saunas.<p><p>“Finnish saunas will become more interesting and gain more global popularity, and they will be regarded for their curative properties as well as a luxurious place of cleansing. Nowadays people see sauna bathing as a social event, so we believe there will be more Löyly-like public bath houses in cities.”<p><p>Opened in 1906, Rajaportti is the oldest Finnish public sauna still operating today.

It is a challenging task to warm up this sauna, as it must be heated with one-metre logs.<p><p>Though the heating process takes time, the steam stones are so large that once they are heated up they stay hot for the whole day.<p><p>In Finnish culture, the sauna is a place to rest and cleanse mind and body. Mobile phones must be turned off; it is enough to listen to the calming hiss of water becoming steam as it hits the stones.<p><p>On Helsinki Sauna Day, many unusual saunas are briefly open to the public. Photo: Harvia<p><p>There are approximately three million saunas in Finland – and there are only about 5.5 million people in the whole country.

This delightful 3.5-kilometre (2.2-mile) nature trail is one of Hossa’s must-sees, according to environmental educator Riitta Nykänen of Parks and Wildlife Finland, who helped to plan the new national park, located in Eastern Finland about 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of Kuusamo.<p><p>“Hossa’s landscapes – including unspoilt forests, and pristine lakes and sandy ridges unchanged since the Ice Age – are somehow quintessentially Finnish, so it’s an excellent choice for a park celebrating our country’s independence,” says Nykänen.<p><p>“There are also historic reasons for the choice, as nearby Suomussalmi was the hometown of Finland’s first president, K.J. Ståhlberg, and an early declaration calling for our independence was signed there. Then during the Second World War fierce battles were fought here in our borderland forests to preserve our independence,” she adds.<p><p>The awe-inspiring ancient rock paintings at Värikallio contain intriguing images of human figures and animals created by early Finnish artists 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Another Hossa highlight is an awe-inspiring set of ancient rock paintings still visible on lakeside cliffs at Värikallio, even though they were painted 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. The paintings include matchstick people, demonic horned figures, recognisable animals, and two striking human-like figures with large triangular heads, who also feature in the national park’s logo.<p><p>A new walkway built over the lake at Värikallio gives visitors great views of the paintings. Experts think they may relate to hunting rituals or shamanistic ceremonies, but no one can know for sure, so it’s tantalising to imagine what their Stone Age Finnish artists may have been thinking.<p><p>Not far from Värikallio lies Julma Ölkky, a long narrow lake overlooked by spectacular rugged cliffs. Keen hikers can trek up one side of the lake and back down the other, thanks to a new hanging footbridge, but the best views of the canyon are from the water. Visitors can join guided canoeing excursions, or hop on scenic boat trips that regularly depart from the southern end of the canyon lake during the summer.<p><p>Free facilities including campfire sites, shelters and open wilderness huts have been improved as part of Hossa’s upgrade from a hiking area to Finland’s newest national park.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Nykänen emphasises the natural diversity of Hossa’s wildlife. “Hossa’s crystal clear streams and lakes are unusually rich in oxygen, since they’re largely spring-fed. This means they’re rich in small aquatic creatures, and consequently also fish and water birds like dippers and divers,” she explains. Hossa is also home to woodland birds including hawks, owls and woodpeckers, as well as otters, lynx and occasional roving bears and wolves.<p><p>Hossa’s conversion from a hiking area into a national park has already increased visitor numbers. Local firms are keenly gearing up to provide more services for visitors with different interests. The small family firm Hossan Lumo, run by local girl Maija Daly and her Irish husband Lenny Daly, rents out equipment including fat tyre mountain bikes, kayaks and stand-up paddle boards, as well as cosy lakeside cabin accommodation.<p><p>Four new mountain biking routes run through Hossa’s unspoilt forests, offering fine views of the national park’s many lakes. Photo: Sini Salmirinne / Metsähallitus<p><p>“Hossa’s clear blue lakes are great for paddling, and there’s been an international boom in SUP-boarding which is now catching on in Finland,” says Lenny Daly.<p><p>Daly feels that the trails along Hossa’s sandy ridges are likewise ideal for mountain biking. “Other enjoyable activities available locally include overnight bear-watching trips, guided war history tours, and winter husky safaris, and even yoga and pilates on SUP-boards,” he adds.<p><p>Reindeer herding is still an important local livelihood here. At Hossa Reindeer Park, on a working farm, visitors can meet, greet and even eat reindeer. And rest assured that if you spot a large animal between the trees out in the park, it’s much more likely to be a shy reindeer than a wolf or a bear.<p><p>By Fran Weaver, June 2017<p><p>Mysterious figures from the distant past<p><p>Wild settings for adventures and relaxation<p><p>Fun on the water<p>", "time": "2017-06-14T08:35:35+00:00", "type": "life"}

Just over 29,000 people live there. More than one-third of them live in the regional capital, Mariehamn, while the smallest of the 16 Åland municipalities, Sottunga, only has about 90 inhabitants.<p><p>Being autonomous, the territory also has the right to enact its own laws and can decide over many key issues. International treaties specify that Åland forms a demilitarised, neutral zone, and it is often cited as an example of how an autonomous minority culture can thrive within a larger nation.<p><p>Important livelihoods nowadays include shipping, tourism, agriculture, banking and trade. We talk with five Ålanders to find out what archipelago life is like.<p><p>“I like to see the positive side of things,” says Anders Wiklund, who is known as one of the most positive people in Åland. “That’s a choice I make every day when I get up.”Photo: Maria Rosenlöf<p><p>In 2016 the Junior Chamber of Commerce in Mariehamn declared Anders Wiklund and his wife Camilla the most positive people in Åland, citing their work for underprivileged members of society.<p><p>They live with their four children, a dog and several cats in a country village north of Mariehamn – a peaceful place with ocean, forest, fields and meadows practically at its doorstep. Anders works as CEO of an Åland company that operates on the global marketplace.<p><p>“Things are on a small scale here but at the same time you can access the global world of work,” he says. “What more could anyone ask for?”<p><p>He enjoys having a stimulating job while also living in a safe place surrounded by beautiful nature and within easy reach of services. In addition to spending time outside hiking and fishing, Anders keeps in shape and runs a few races each year. On days off he likes to spend time at his cottage on Kökar, Åland’s most easterly municipality. There he can take a breather from everyday life and focus entirely on his family.<p><p>“I find it so empowering to see the difference you can make for other people just by helping out,” he says. “I like to see the positive side of things. That’s a choice I make every day when I get up.”<p><p>Mia Hanström moved to Åland from Sweden more than 30 years ago. She enjoys the proximity to nature and the changing seasons.Photo: Maria Rosenlöf<p><p>Mia Hanström, originally from Sweden, moved to mainland Åland – that’s what they call the biggest island in the archipelago – more than 30 years ago when she got a job there. Some years later she spotted an opportunity to move to Kumlinge, an island east of the mainland with just over 300 inhabitants. She lives close to nature and can experience the changing seasons, which she very much appreciates.<p><p>“That’s why I don’t mind putting up with all the trips back and forth from Kumlinge,” she says.<p><p>Mia is self-employed as a consultant in youth and equal opportunities work. She also manages an educational group and is active in various associations and governing boards. The journey between Kumlinge and Mariehamn takes two or three hours each way by car and ferry. Her solution is telecommuting, and it works well. She has an office at home in Kumlinge and an office space in Mariehamn, and she gets a lot of work done on the ferry.<p><p>“I’m very focused on making the most of the time I spend travelling,” she says.<p><p>At home on Kumlinge she has her family and a variety of animals – donkeys, horses, cats, chickens and even bees. “What I like best of all,” she says, “is to be with outdoors with my animals.” The family also hosts volunteers on the farm.<p><p>“This is quality of life – nature on your doorstep, and right by the water,” she says. “The sea atmosphere is good for your soul.”<p><p>Kenneth “Kenta” Sandvik works as a postman, but is also a powerlifter with European and world records under his belt.Photo: Maria Rosenlöf<p><p>Kenneth “Kenta” Sandvik is a postman who also has numerous Finnish, European and world championship powerlifting titles under his belt, including European and world records.

What you lift depends on how well your training has gone.”<p><p>He says that sport forms an important part of Åland society and business life, and good financial assistance is available in the form of contributions and sponsors.<p><p>“Of course it’s a bit trickier to travel to competitions when you live on an island,” he says. “But living in Åland is cosy.

When she comes home to Åland after long, often intensive periods away, that’s when she appreciates Åland the most. It’s a place where she can catch her breath. The sea air and the sight of the water are important to her.<p><p>“I walk along the water to clear my thoughts and get some peace,” she says. “Åland allows me to stop and catch up with myself. The good thing about Åland is that I can come here whenever I want. It’s my stopover.

{"title": "A Finnish hipster named Mannerheim - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-hipster-named-mannerheim/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1867–1951) commanded the Finnish armed forces during the Second World War and went on to serve as president. His house in Helsinki is now the Mannerheim Museum and shows off his collection of weapons, his hunting trophies and his taste in interior decoration.<p><p>His residence forms a real work of installation art. The visitor enters different worlds in the various rooms because Mannerheim, ever cosmopolitan, wanted the décor to present diverse cultural trends, from English nuances to French ambience. That’s how Mannerheim Museum curator Kristina Ranki describes the house.<p><p>One of the most important figures in the history of independent Finland, Mannerheim leased the villa when he was 57 from Karl Fazer, the owner of a candy factory. Mannerheim lived there, surrounded by the greenery of Kaivopuisto, the park that covers the southern tip of Helsinki, until he passed away. The great man’s residence was subsequently opened to the public as a museum.<p><p>“The reception rooms for prestigious guests were downstairs, while upstairs was more for his private use,” says Ranki. Except for the three exhibition rooms upstairs, the residence remains almost exactly as it was when Mannerheim was alive.<p><p>“A visit to the museum and the guides’ stories are sure to provide a new kind of experience,” says Ranki, “even for people who have read their war history and think they already know everything about Mannerheim.”<p><p>Akseli Gallen-Kallela painted this sitting portrait of Mannerheim; a standing portrait by the same artist hangs in the Mannerheim Museum.Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/ Lehtikuva<p><p>The only object brought to the museum later is a classic portrait of Mannerheim painted in 1929 by a good friend of his, the prominent artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The painting reveals a lot about its subject. It conveys the essential nature of a Renaissance regent and his dandyish sense of style, with his sword of honour and his tailcoat.<p><p>Mannerheim was neurotically meticulous not only about his appearance, but also about his public image: He demanded the right to inspect all photos of him before publication to make sure that no signs of fatigue were visible.<p><p>As a young military officer, Mannerheim was already extremely particular about grooming. Later in his career, when he had attained the title of field marshal, he ordered bespoke clothing from foreign tailors, with details according to his wishes. The gentleman’s civilian outfits were always immaculate, but for reasons of style the commander-in-chief took liberties even with military uniform etiquette. Mannerheim considered narrow lampasses, or trouser stripes, more elegant than the wide stripes that would have been in accordance with regulations for his military rank. For this reason he preferred to wear a uniform of lower rank.<p><p>Mannerheim’s bedroom contains an army-style cot, just as it did when he was alive.Photo: Pekka Holmström/ Otavamedia/Lehtikuva<p><p>The walls of Mannerheim’s home are decorated with dozens of hunting trophies, of which the most famous is probably the tiger skin on the floor of the salon. He killed the Bengal tiger while visiting India in 1937. Nor did he ever go hunting looking like a novice; he rode out on horseback dressed as stylishly as if he were going to war. His wardrobe included a red tailcoat and black top hat to wear while hunting.<p><p>Mannerheim took care of his grooming otherwise, too, and not only when he was entertaining – he was well aware of the impact his elegant appearance had on other people. For example, in addition to a toothbrush, he used an innovation of his time – a water jet. Menthol drops were added to a device resembling a small pressure washer attached to the bathroom wall, and then he could carefully rinse his teeth.<p><p>His boots gleamed, every hair was in place and his moustache was correctly shaped, even on his deathbed. A real dandy.<p><p>“He represented the gentleman’s culture,” says Ranki. “Nowadays Mannerheim could perhaps be called a hipster, if the word is taken to mean a person who cares about his own appearance.”<p><p>Wealthy chocolate manufacturer Karl Fazer leased this house in Helsinki to Mannerheim for decades; it is now a museum.Photo: Ilkka A. Suominen/ Lehtikuva<p><p>The smartness of the residence emphasised Mannerheim’s aesthetic sensibility, which extended from his own appearance to the matching colours of the décor in his house.<p><p>“Military discipline is visible in the home,” says Ranki. “Mannerheim himself paid attention to every detail and made sure that everything was exactly in place. He wanted his home to present a certain image of himself, which was conveyed in the items on display – hunting trophies, official gifts and, placed on the grand piano, pictures of heads of state.”<p><p>By Marko Ylitalo, June 2017<p><p>Elegance before etiquette<p><p>A home says something about its inhabitant<p><p>Welcome to a work of art<p>", "time": "2017-06-02T08:19:36+00:00", "type": "life"}

He guided the country through the transition from war to peace.<p><p>He served in the Russian army, where he attained the rank of general, before Finland gained independence in 1917. Later, in Finland, he was made a field marshal, and during the Second World War he was commander-in-chief of the Finnish forces and subsequently became president. No soldier had previously been president of Finland – nor has one been chosen for the post since Mannerheim. He was 78 when he retired, citing health reasons.<p><p>Mannerheim poses in his Russian army uniform in the early 1900s.Photo: Lehtikuva<p><p>Mannerheim was a Finn by birth, but he joined the Russian army in the autumn of 1887, at the age of 20, and served the emperor for 30 years. He was very close to the Imperial Court. After the revolution, Mannerheim fled to Finland in January 1918.<p><p>Immediately after gaining independence, Finland experienced a short but merciless civil war between the Reds, or socialists, and the Whites, or the bourgeois forces. Mannerheim led the White army, which defeated the Reds, often by means of harsh measures. Foreign powers also intervened in the Civil War: Germany supported the Whites and Soviet Russia the Reds.<p><p>The Civil War divided the nation, and its scars started healing only in the late 1930s, when Mannerheim began to reach out to the Left and succeeded in gaining the trust of the Social Democrats.<p><p>During the 1920s and 1930s, Mannerheim had many detractors in Finland, but when the Soviet Union attacked Finland in the autumn of 1939, the Social Democrats approved his appointment as commander-in-chief of the army. He retained the trust of the Left during the Continuation War, also against the Soviet Union, which began in the summer of 1941.<p><p>Over the decades, new buildings have gone up around Helsinki’s statue of Mannerheim, and today kids on skateboards perform tricks on the surrounding plaza.Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>When Parliament elected Mannerheim president in August 1944, Finland’s independence was in great danger. Finland had been at war with the Soviet Union for three years and had had a military alliance with Germany.<p><p>The Soviet army had been attacking all summer. The Finnish army had been forced to retreat and suffered heavy losses. The war had already claimed the lives of 70,000 Finnish soldiers.<p><p>Parliament wanted Finland to terminate the alliance with Germany and make a separate peace with the Soviet Union.<p><p>Members of Parliament thought that only Mannerheim would possess the authority to lead the country from war to peace. For this reason, leading right-wing, centre and leftist politicians persuaded a reluctant Mannerheim to become head of state. Despite the burden of history, Mannerheim succeeded in the role.<p><p>An armistice was agreed with the Soviet Union in the autumn of 1944. Its terms were heavy, but the country was spared from occupation and maintained its independence and its democratic system. Finland broke away from the alliance with Germany and expelled the German troops from northern Finland during the winter of 1945.<p><p>After the war, the Soviet Union demanded that Finland’s wartime leadership be punished. At the insistence of the Soviet Union, President Risto Ryti, Prime Minister Edvin Linkomies and Minister of Finance Väinö Tanner, who was also chairman of the Social Democratic party during the war, were convicted, along with others.<p><p>By contrast, Mannerheim was not convicted, even though his position during the war was at least as important as those of the political leaders who received sentences. The Soviet Union did not actively demand his conviction, though after the war the Soviet press criticised him strongly.<p><p>In July 1941, Mannerheim (right) walks with President Risto Ryti (middle) and Prime Minister Jukka Rangell through the town of Mikkeli, where the military had its headquarters.Photo: SA-kuva/Lehtikuva<p><p>Mannerheim’s long career has been under evaluation since his death in 1951. The assessments have been conflicting and often politically coloured. In addition, the Cold War made it difficult to weigh his life’s work. The Soviet Union readily interjected when Mannerheim formed the topic of public discussion in Finland.<p><p>Since the end of the Cold War, however, opinions have been nearly unanimous on one point: Mannerheim’s short period as president, leading Finland from war to peace, was his most important achievement.<p><p>Even his harshest critics are willing to admit that Mannerheim was the right person for the job at that particular time. It’s unlikely that any other Finn would have had more success than Mannerheim did.<p><p>Mannerheim’s life and career have been studied more than those of any other Finnish person. Almost 300 books about him have been published in Finland and abroad, and new studies are constantly appearing.<p><p>He continues to be the subject of a wide range of conflicts among historians. Some authors admire him and even worship him as a hero and saviour of the fatherland. Other books criticise his actions during the Civil War or question his skills as a wartime leader in the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–44).<p><p>Mannerheim’s life also fascinates ordinary Finns from one generation to the next. His Helsinki residence has been a museum for over 60 years and is still very popular.

He was born on November 25, 1923 in the southwestern city of Turku and passed away on May 12, 2017 in Helsinki.<p><p>After succeeding Finland’s long-term president Urho Kekkonen, Koivisto gave parliament a more prominent role in Finland’s democratic system. By the end of his period in office, he had found a new place for Finland in a rapidly evolving Europe.<p><p>Koivisto won presidential elections in 1982 and 1988, with his popularity extending across traditional political party boundaries.<p><p>Many Finns knew him by the nickname “Manu.” He was regarded as a decent, handsome and relaxed man of the people, somewhat prone to ramble during his speeches. This image certainly suited Koivisto himself, and he carefully nurtured it.<p><p>In political circles people knew quite a different Koivisto: a skilled strategist who didn’t waste time on petty bickering, since he always had a master plan in mind. He successfully achieved this plan in his own career, as well as during his time as head of state.<p><p>Koivisto did not shirk from forceful action. He knew that there was no room at the top for the soft-hearted.<p><p>President Mauno Koivisto and his wife Tellervo wave before boarding a plane for an official visit to Sweden in 1982, early in his presidency.Photo: Matti Björkman/Lehtikuva<p><p>Koivisto was the first Finnish president from a left-wing background, from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) – and the first with working-class roots.<p><p>He also represented a generation who came of age in wartime. As a young man he fought against the Soviets in the Continuation War (1941–44). After the war he did hard manual work in the Turku Harbour, while also studying until he obtained a PhD in sociology.<p><p>Throughout his life Koivisto lived by the virtues he learnt in his religious, working-class childhood home. He had a modest lifestyle, and was never prone to extravagant gestures in his private life or in politics.<p><p>Koivisto felt a strong Finnish identity, but from his youth he was also an internationalist. Friendship between peoples was never an empty political cliché to him. When at the start of his presidency he said he wanted to “build world peace,” the promise came right from his heart.<p><p>The Finnish people first became aware of Koivisto when he was appointed minister of finance in spring 1966, moving from his previous position running the Helsinki Workers’ Savings Bank. Though Koivisto willingly participated in academic debates on economic policy, and was politically active within the SDP, earlier in his life he had not wanted to go into politics as his main career.<p><p>In 1967 Koivisto had only just been named governor of the Bank of Finland when President Urho Kekkonen enticed him to take on the mantle of prime minister.<p><p>Kekkonen and Koivisto worked well together until the spring of 1970, when their opinions of how Finland should regard the planned Nordic economic alliance Nordek differed radically. Koivisto wanted Finland to join Nordek, but Kekkonen was suspicious about the project. Koivisto then returned to the Bank of Finland, where he stayed for nine long years. The President and the country’s leading banker had to get along, though it was far from easy.<p><p>Mauno Koivisto returned to the hurly burly of everyday politics in spring 1979. He served as prime minister again until autumn 1981, when Kekkonen, who had led Finland for 25 years, fell ill, and Koivisto became acting president until elections could be held.<p><p>During the Helsinki Summit in September 1990, Finnish President Mauno Koivisto and his wife Tellervo (centre) hosted Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife Raisa (left) and US President George Bush and his wife Barbara.Photo: Juha Kärkkäinen/Lehtikuva<p><p>At the start of his presidency Mauno Koivisto was 58, with plenty of experience in domestic politics, particularly in economic policy. Contrastingly, he was not so knowledgeable in the field of foreign policy, and approached it very cautiously during his first six-year term.<p><p>Koivisto’s foreign policies continued broadly along the lines of those of his predecessors, Kekkonen and Juho Paasikivi, especially with regard to relations with the Soviet Union. The Finnish-Soviet Friendship Agreement was extended for 20 more years.<p><p>In domestic politics Koivisto was keen to strengthen the roles of Parliament and the government, while reducing the President’s own power and influence.<p><p>During Koivisto’s second term, from 1988 to 1994, Finland’s external relations changed greatly, due to upheavals in both Eastern and Western Europe.<p><p>In the East the Soviet system collapsed, while in the West cooperation intensified. Relations between the great powers also changed as the Cold War ended. Since 1983 Koivisto had corresponded in secret with both Mikhail Gorbachev and George H.W. Bush. In autumn 1990 the leaders of the two superpowers expressed a desire to meet in Helsinki. This choice of venue clearly reflected Koivisto’s prominent role in encouraging such a summit.<p><p>Finland’s relations with both the Soviet Union and the US had remained good through the final stages of the Cold War. During this period Koivisto also encouraged Gorbachev to persevere with his dramatic reforms to the Soviet system. Under Koivisto’s leadership Finland resolved to apply for EU membership in the winter of 1992. This was a momentous decision, one of the main political landmarks of Finland’s history since independence. Under the Finnish Constitution at that time, only the President could initiate such a move.<p><p>Membership negotiations concluded on March 1, 1994, just a few hours after Koivisto had handed over the presidency to his successor, Martti Ahtisaari.<p><p>Mauno Koivisto in 2001, when the Swedish-language version of his autobiography was published.Photo: Dan Hansson/ TT/Lehtikuva<p><p>Until recent years Koivisto continued to work in his small office in Helsinki. He wrote several books, but only occasionally participated in political debate. He could often be seen on the streets of Helsinki or taking a tram. He tried to keep active even though his strength was fading.<p><p>In January 2013 Koivisto granted what would be his last newspaper interview to Helsingin Sanomat, Finland’s largest daily. When asked about the worthwhile things in life, he replied: “In life it’s usually wise to trust that everything’s going well, even when that’s not what you really believe. All too often threats have started to actually materialise namely because people have been preparing to deal with them.”<p><p>By Unto Hämäläinen, May 2017 This article was originally published in Finnish in the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on May 13, 2017.

At times the seal scratches its neck with its front paw or rolls from one side to the other. But mostly it just basks on the rock. Sometimes it is joined by another seal, which does what its companion is doing – not much of anything.<p><p>This spectacle of Saimaa ringed seals (their Finnish name is saimaannorppa) hooked people in May 2016 when WWF started streaming it via webcam as Norppalive. Returning in 2017, it consists of a wildlife camera broadcasting real-time video from a rock popular among the seals.<p><p>The Saimaa ringed seals attracted enormous attention and put viewers in good spirits. Norppalive received over two million views during a one-month period.<p><p>“People experienced Norppalive as soothing,” says WWF communications officer Joonas Fritze. “Even though seals weren’t always visible on the rock, just the beautiful natural environment of Lake Saimaa produced a zen-like feeling. Sighting a seal was the icing on the cake.”<p><p>The immensely popular Norppalive webcast goes online again in May and June. This time, the seals’ reality TV is also being streamed abroad via an English-language website (link below).<p><p>This seal, nicknamed Pullervo, showed up to delight Norppalive viewers in the service’s inaugural year.Photo courtesy of WWF Finland<p><p>The Saimaa ringed seal is one of very few species of freshwater seals in the world. It was isolated in Lake Saimaa, now Finland’s largest lake, about 8,000 years ago, when the link to the Baltic Sea broke after the Ice Age. The Saimaa ringed seal is an iconic and rare animal – if it disappears from Lake Saimaa, it will disappear from the face of the earth.<p><p>“The goal of Norppalive is to raise people’s awareness of the Saimaa ringed seal and its life, and to increase the desire to protect it,” says Fritze.<p><p>The greatest threats to the Saimaa ringed seal are fishing net deaths and climate change.<p><p>“Fishing is highlighted more because it is easier to influence than climate change,” says Petteri Tolvanen, a programme director at WWF.<p><p>Statutory and voluntary fishing restrictions have improved the situation of the Saimaa ringed seal, but even so, the number of seal pups living to reproductive age is not as high as it should be. Pups die in nets and certain kinds of fish traps, where they get stuck and drown. Adult seals also die in fishing tackle.<p><p>During the month of Norppalive streaming in 2016, more than 120 people pledged on the WWF website to give up net fishing on Lake Saimaa. This represented a huge addition, as 240 had already pledged in the previous two years. Donations on behalf of the Saimaa ringed seal also increased.<p><p>Climate change and fishing net deaths form the greatest threats to the Saimaa ringed seal.Photo: Mervi Kunnasranta/WWF Finland<p><p>All means of protecting the Saimaa ringed seal are necessary. Thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the seal population has gradually risen from 150 to 360 individuals, but this is still far from a viable population.<p><p>“The Saimaa ringed seal remains highly endangered,” says Tolvanen. “The official interim goal is 400 seals by the year 2025. Then extinction would no longer be an immediate threat, but even that is in no way adequate.”<p><p>The population is estimated annually on the basis of seal births – the more accurate the birth count is, the more precise the population figures are. In spring 2016, 86 seal pups were born, a number greater than any year in the previous three decades. In 2017, the corresponding figure is 82.<p><p>The pups are born in late February. Net fishing restrictions to protect Saimaa ringed seal pups are in force in the seals’ key habitats from mid-April to the end of June. The use of certain types of fishing tackle is prohibited throughout the year.<p><p>The fishing restrictions are opposed by a small but vocal group.<p><p>“I’m glad that people’s wish to protect the Saimaa ringed seal through fishing restrictions is greater in areas populated by the seal than elsewhere in Finland,” Tolvanen says.<p><p>The Norppalive camera has a peaceful, zen-like influence on viewers, who watch the seals basking in the sun.Photo courtesy of WWF Finland<p><p>If climate change is not checked, future prospects for the Saimaa ringed seal are bleak.<p><p>The seals need snow and ice to survive. The female seal builds her nesting lair in a snowdrift – it’s safe to give birth there, and the pup stays dry and warm. However, winters with little snowfall are becoming increasingly common.<p><p>“In the future, there may be winters when we don’t even have ice [on the lake],” Tolvanen says. “In bad winters, pup mortality can reach up to half of all births.”<p><p>Fortunately, people can pile up snow into snowbanks that can act as nesting sites for the seals. In the winter of 2014, when there was very little snow, more than 90 percent of the season’s seal pups were born in nests built in human-made snowdrifts.<p><p>Even if you don’t live close enough to help build nesting sites for the Saimaa ringed seals, you can still follow them and participate in conservation efforts online. The Norppalive webcam link is right here. And as the WWF website says, “Chances are it will be the cutest Finn you’ll ever see.”<p><p>By Tiina Suomalainen, May 2017<p><p>Norppalive increases desire to protect seals<p><p>Intensely threatened<p><p>Building snowbanks helps<p>", "time": "2017-05-10T11:37:14+00:00", "type": "life"}

I’ve read other texts by foreigners who are quite direct in repeating those stereotypes. I wanted to write something that was more open to interpretation that perhaps the reader might connect with. I thought it would be more strategic to write a set of stories. I wanted to describe my own personal experience of how I found Finns to be.”<p><p>All around the world, says Walker, Finnish teachers have a glowing reputation for being the best. “One of the things that shocked me was how relaxed Finnish teachers could be. I’d understood they were always on task, never taking a break, and they would be busy all the time.”<p><p>His wife had spent time as a substitute teacher and told him that Finnish teachers often go to the lounge, drink coffee, and flick through magazines. “Since I’ve been in Finland, in just about every school I have visited, I have seen teachers doing just that, taking it easy in the lounge,” says Walker. “I also found that I could be more healthy and relaxed if I did the same thing.”<p><p>By Tim Bird, April 2017<p><p>Writer by coincidence<p><p>Learning moments<p><p>Sidestepping the stereotypes<p>", "time": "2017-04-12T07:57:41+00:00", "type": "life"}

His ultra-quick hands produced wrister after wrister goal, occasionally catching his veteran teammates off guard.<p><p>Laine’s only concern that day looked to be the mid-March East Coast snowstorm that had postponed the Jets’ late-season game against the New Jersey Devils the night before, leaving him with bewilderment and time on his hands. Sure, the Jets are close to being eliminated from the playoffs, but Laine wanted to play. After all, that’s what he’s here for.<p><p>“I haven’t seen that one before, where the game gets cancelled because of a little bit of snow,” he says, sitting in front of his locker. News reports show that the storm covered locations in and around New York with 15 to 60 centimetres (6 to 24 inches) of snow. “I really didn’t understand why we couldn’t play. But I’m not deciding that. I’m going to play when they tell me to play.”<p><p><p><p>Patrik Laine answers fans’ questions about life in the NHL on the Winnipeg Jets’ Youtube channel.<p><p>As most teenagers might, Laine spent his idle moments that evening watching TV and playing videogames in his hotel room. Despite his imposing size of 193 centimetres (6-foot-4) and 95 kilogrammes (210 pounds), Laine isn’t legally old enough to join his veteran teammates, who might have been tempted to enjoy the over-21 delights of New York City, two train stops away.<p><p>Two nights later in Brooklyn, his youthful indiscretion was on display at Barclays Center. Frustrated when an opponent took the puck from him, Laine reacted with a silly high-sticking penalty in a 4–2 victory over the New York Islanders, confirming that even one of the best players in the NHL is still, at least by the calendar, occasionally a kid.<p><p>Youth aside, the hard-shooting forward has already made an indelible impression on the NHL and could be on his way to becoming one of the greatest Finnish players in league history, up there with Jari Kurri, Teemu Selänne and Esa Tikkanen.<p><p>So what makes this precocious rookie special among the finest hockey players in the world?<p><p>“He’s got a shot that nobody understands,” Jets coach Paul Maurice says. “We slow it down on video, watch the flex, and there’s all different kinds. There’s the one-timer with incredible velocity on it. The wrister that gets off his stick before you think [it would be possible]. And at that age, or at any age, you just don’t see that shot very often.”<p><p>Patrik Laine veers after placing a shot on Nashville Predators goalie Pekka Rinne, another star Finnish player.Photo: Mark Humphrey/AP/Lehtikuva<p><p>Laine, turning 19 years old on April 19, 2017, has become such a sensation in his first season that knowledgeable NHL insiders say he will win the Calder Trophy, awarded to the league’s best rookie. Before voting commences, it has become a two-man race between Toronto’s Auston Matthews, who was the first pick in the 2016 NHL draft, and Laine, who was number two. (Two other Finnish players were also selected in the top five that year: Jesse Puljujärvi and Olli Juolevi.)<p><p>At the time of writing in late March, Laine was tied for fourth in the NHL in goals with 34, including three hat tricks (three goals in a single game), while Matthews had 33 goals. Each had 27 assists, leaving Laine ahead of Matthews in total points, as well.<p><p>“If you watched practice today, you watch his hands and the number of times he scores, you think this guy has got to be the best kid in the league,” Maurice says. “I’m sure Toronto thinks that way about Auston Matthews.<p><p>“But Patty Laine is a markedly different player than he was at the start of the year. The reason that story won’t get told is his scoring has been pretty darned consistent. He came in as a shooter and he’s done that all year. But his play away from the puck has made huge strides. And he’s still 18.”<p><p>If Laine wins as expected, he will become the first Finn to be named rookie of the year since Selänne, who also got his NHL start with the Jets, in 1993 at the age of 23 after six seasons with Jokerit in Helsinki.<p><p>“I think it would be awesome,” Laine says. “We have a lot of great rookies this year and everyone is doing well. That would be a nice achievement for me. I try to be a good player every day and hopefully I can get that.”<p><p><p><p>Surprise! Patrik Laine shows up at a local boy’s birthday party in Winnipeg.<p><p>As for Laine’s quick assimilation into the NHL, Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff credits what he calls the “Selänne effect,” explaining that a Finnish player getting his start in the NHL’s smallest market could make for an easier transition.<p><p>“There’s probably not a lot of difference between Winnipeg and Finland in that even the big cities there are not that large,” Cheveldayoff says. “When Selänne came over here he embraced Winnipeg, and certainly Winnipeg embraced him. Patrik has done the same, but Patrik is his own guy.”<p><p>Laine’s family has contributed to making his life in Canada more comfortable. His mother came from Tampere, their hometown in southern central Finland, to live with him during the first half of the season, and his father is in Winnipeg for the second half. “It’s been a big help for me,” the teenager says. “I don’t have to worry about anything else but playing hockey. It’s nice because there is always food on the table when I’m at home and everything else is in order. It has been a little bit easier.”<p><p>Laine says he misses Tampere and plans to return in the off-season for the summer. With the Jets pretty much out of the race to qualify for the playoffs, he is determined to finish what is left of the season strongly, but he has had plenty of time to gain the admiration of his teammates.<p><p>“He’s a very respectful young man,” Cheveldayoff says. “You look at how he integrates with the veteran players. He doesn’t automatically walk into a room and think, ‘I’m here.’ He walks in and he’s respectful with them, he’s respectful with the coaches, the trainers. He signs autographs until the bus has to leave. When you sit back in my position and watch and observe, it’s how a person acts when no one is watching. For him, he doesn’t change at all.”<p><p>Laine lets a shot loose in a game against the Colorado Avalanche.Photo: Scott D. Stivason/ AP/Lehtikuva<p><p>Laine used to play for the Tampere club Tappara (tappara means “battleaxe”). His former teammates there have expressed astonishment at his progressive toughness and maturity in the NHL, especially how quickly he bounced back from a concussion, caused by a vicious hit from Buffalo’s Jake McCabe. Laine missed eight games over 17 days while recovering, which makes it all the more significant that he’s nonetheless ahead of Matthews in the stats.<p><p>Cheveldayoff says Laine has earned respect from the start with his physical play and quick adaptation to the NHL rinks, which are narrower than those in Europe.<p><p>Most important, Laine knows he is good, and he’s not shy about saying it.<p><p>“I think I’ve always had the confidence, but the game was so much different, but now I can see I can play well in this league and score and produce things,” he says. “I’ve always believed in myself. But now it’s easier to see I’m going to be a good player in this league.”<p><p>By Michael Hunt, March 2017<p><p>A shot that nobody understands<p><p>Taking huge strides<p><p>From Tampere to Winnipeg<p><p>Quick to adapt<p>", "time": "2017-03-24T12:41:38+00:00", "type": "life"}

On a frosty winter morning, the silence on the island is repeatedly broken by a stream of scantily clad figures scampering between a low sauna building and a jetty before bravely plunging into a large hole cut into the frozen surface of the ocean.<p><p>Each winter as many as 150,000 Finns “enjoy” taking regular dips in the chilly lakes and sea bays. People who are unfamiliar with the practice often ask one question: Why?<p><p>“The shock of the icy water gives you a cold rush that makes you feel really alive, and afterwards you feel extremely calm and refreshed,” explains Jonas Sipilä, secretary of Uunisaari Arctic Swimming Club. “You leave your stress behind in the sea, and the whole experience is quite addictive.”<p><p>The club has about 220 members, ages 12 to 75, from shipyard workers to managing directors. Most live locally, like Sipilä, who takes the plunge at Uunisaari almost every day, even when the sauna is not heated. The keenest aficionados still swim at Uunisaari when air temperatures plummet to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit), since water temperatures always stay just above zero Celsius (32 Fahrenheit).<p><p>At the national winter swimming championships, the low temperatures can easily make the lanes seem longer than 25 metres (82 feet).Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>The club’s chairperson, Sirkka Mäkeläinen, is convinced that regular indulgers enjoy many physical and mental health benefits as well as a buzz. “Most feel they suffer less from stress, colds and painful ailments,” she says. “Many also say they sleep better at night and feel more awake during the day.”<p><p>Scientific studies show that cold immersions can also reduce blood pressure and promote the growth of healthy brown adipose tissue, improving cold tolerance. Cold shocks also trigger the brain’s production of endorphin hormones, which enhance pain resistance and create a sense of euphoria.<p><p>“There’s definitely a feeling of overcoming an exciting challenge,” says Mäkeläinen, as we sip warm drinks in Uunisaari’s cosy café after our icy ordeal. “There’s also a social side to winter swimming clubs, especially since having a sauna together is often part of the experience. I’ve made many friends through the club.”<p><p>The season-appropriate winter coats and snowsuits of the fans make for a comical contrast with the swimsuit-clad contestants.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>Finland has over 200 registered winter swimming clubs and facilities, while many more people make smaller ice-holes near their homes using spades or chainsaws.<p><p>National championships have been held in various locations annually since 1989, though Finns are known to have relished this eccentric pursuit since the 17th century. The first clubs were founded back in the 1920s.<p><p>The 2017 championships, held at the lakeside Tanhuvaara Sports Institute in eastern Finland, attracted nearly 800 participants competing in age groups from under-20s to over-70s, and about the same number of landlubber spectators. “For 2017 we added new events, including 50-metre breaststroke and 25-metre freestyle, as well as the traditional 25-metre breaststroke and exciting 4×25-metre relay races,” says co-organiser Hanna Okkonen, who coordinates winter swimming activities for the Outdoor Association of Finland. “Competitor numbers show that winter swimming is particularly popular among middle-aged women, but the youngest entrant was 13, and the oldest 84.”<p><p>Swimmers show off all kinds of hats, from bathing caps to top hats to – this.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>Headwear is compulsory – in the shape of conventional bathing caps or silly woolly hats – and frogmen are on standby in case anyone flounders.

She swims outdoors near her home in the eastern Finnish town of Punkaharju twice weekly all year round. “It’s worth practising swimming style, starts and turns regularly ahead of big events,” she says. “I’ll be 80 next year for the 2018 championships, but largely thanks to swimming I don’t suffer from any rheumatism – and I can’t remember when I last had a cold.”<p><p>Selenius is already mentoring a young successor: 14-year-old Viivi Paasonen, from the same swimming club. Paasonen swam 25 metres in less than 20 seconds at this year’s Finnish championships. “I’ve swum competitively since I was 8, but this is my first winter season,” she says. “My schoolmates are amazed that I dare to do it, but it’s a great feeling swimming in an ice hole.

For coaches at US universities and in the NBA, big European players who can shoot are nothing new, but seeing one as tall as Markkanen combine extraordinary grace, fluidity and accuracy gets their attention.<p><p>Hanno Möttölä, Finland’s best-known basketball player from the generation before Markkanen, coaches a programme for talented teenagers called Helsinki Basketball Academy, part of the Mäkelänrinne Sports High School, where the schedule helps players keep up in both academics and sports. In 2016 he began receiving inquiries from American colleges about one of the stars of the squad.<p><p>Approaching the 213-centimetre (seven-foot) frame he would eventually grow into, Lauri Markkanen was already beginning to turn heads on the continent, but coaches from the University of Arizona were astonished when they saw the video Möttölä had sent them. They’d seen tall European players with good shots, but they’d never seen one of Markkanen’s height display such poise and precision.<p><p>Arizona coach Sean Miller got himself to Helsinki as soon as he could and treated Markkanen to a meal of reindeer, mashed potatoes and cranberries at a restaurant on Senate Square. Not long afterward, Markkanen decided to enroll at the desert school that could not be more geographically dissimilar from his homeland.<p><p>The result was spectacular.<p><p>Playing for Finland (in blue) against France in the U20 European Championship in 2016, Lauri Markkanen rises above the competition.Photo: Roni Rekomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>Basketball is a growing sport in Finland. The country, whose national team is nicknamed the Wolf Pack, competed in the World Cup tournament for the first time in 2014. Helsinki cohosted the European Championship in August and September 2017, with Finland placing second in their group and progressing to the round of 16, only to lose to Italy.<p><p>Prior to 2017, two Finnish players had reached the most competitive league in the world, the National Basketball Association.<p><p>There is Möttölä, the 208-centimetre (six-foot-ten) forward from Helsinki who played at the University of Utah and was chosen 40th overall in the 2000 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks, for whom he played two seasons.<p><p>Then there is Erik Murphy, the same height, who was drafted 68th overall in 2013 by the Chicago Bulls. Born in Lyon, France, Murphy played for the Finnish national team in 2014 and 2015, eligible because his mother, Päivi Murphy, is Finnish.<p><p>In June 2017, Markkanen became the third. The Minnesota Timberwolves picked him seventh overall in the 2017 NBA draft, shortly after his 20th birthday. Before the draft was over, he was part of a trade and ended up on the Chicago Bulls, where he is starting his pro career after playing for Finland in the European Championship.<p><p>Born in Vantaa, just north of Helsinki, and raised in the central Finnish city of Jyväskylä, he finished his freshman season with the Arizona Wildcats in spring 2017. The team was one of the favourites to win the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I championship, but ended up getting knocked out of the playoffs three games into the post-season.<p><p>Going into the national tournament, which is nicknamed March Madness, Markkanen led the seventh-ranked Wildcats in scoring at more than 15 points a game. The top scorer in the U20 European Championship in 2016, Markkanen became eligible for the draft because he had played the requisite one year of college basketball. Talent scouts verified his immediate readiness for the NBA, listing his size, coordination, physique, shooting mechanics and athleticism as the basis for a successful career.<p><p>Markkanen, who scored a career-high 30 points against rival Arizona State in January 2017, became a finalist for nearly every major award in college basketball. In January, a US sports website anointed him the best-shooting seven-footer college basketball has ever seen.<p><p>Lauri Markkanen (left) goes up for a rebound in a University of Arizona game against the University of California.Photo: Chris Coduto/AFP/Lehtikuva<p><p>Whereas European players coming to America were once considered mechanical, awkward shooters, future NBA Hall of Famer Dirk Nowitzki of Germany was one of the big men who changed that perception with his fluid motion. As continental coaching began to improve and the NBA’s influence spread to Europe, genetically gifted youngsters like Markkanen began reaping the benefits. Because of his outside touch, NBA scouts believe Markkanen, like Nowitzki, will be suited to playing on the wing.<p><p>It doesn’t hurt that Markkanen, like Möttölä and Murphy, comes from an athletic background. Möttölä is a second cousin of top-level hockey players Jarkko Ruutu and Tuomo Ruutu. Both of Murphy’s parents played basketball; his father, Connecticut-born Jay Murphy, played in the NBA and in Europe.<p><p>Markkanen’s parents also played basketball. Pekka Markkanen played at the powerhouse University of Kansas for one season and later on the Finnish national team. His brother, Eero, is a professional soccer player with the Swedish club AIK, as well as a member of the Finnish national squad.<p><p>The six-foot-ten Pekka passed on his size to his son, who is said to have worked four or five hours a day while growing up in Jyväskylä on the jump shot that could again put Finland on the global basketball map.<p><p>“I have to be a little bit selfish and give credit to myself,” Markkanen recently told Sports Illustrated magazine. “The actual amount, the work I put in, it’s like, I can’t even tell you how many hours I put in on a daily basis to work on my shot.” However, he also remembers to give due credit to his mother, father and coaches.<p><p>Now the world will see what Arizona saw.<p><p>By Michael Hunt, March 2017, updated October 2017<p><p>High-flying Finns and March Madness<p><p>Blood, sweat and cheers<p>", "time": "2017-03-10T06:40:32+00:00", "type": "life"}

The idea forms part of a wider campaign to celebrate Finnish food culture and encourage everyone to cherish quintessentially Finnish foods.<p><p>“The idea of publicly choosing a national food proved to be very popular,” says Seija Kurunmäki, executive director of the ELO Foundation for the Promotion of Finnish Food Culture. “In the first round of the vote, about 10,000 people responded with suggestions proposing 1,000 different foods. From these ideas a jury of experts chose a shortlist of 12 nationally popular dishes for the final vote.”<p><p>Almost 40,000 Finns then voted for their favourite foods in autumn 2016. The winner, rye bread, attracted nearly 10,000 votes, reflecting its nationwide popularity among people of all ages and social backgrounds. Kurunmäki says that a loaf of crusty, dark brown rye bread is invariably the first thing that Finns living abroad ask visitors from their homeland to bring.<p><p>Certain kinds of rye bread are hung up to dry – traditionally the racks would have been placed in the rafters of a log cabin.Photo:Vastavalo/Visit Finland<p><p>Restaurateur and TV chef Henri Alén, who served on the jury, agrees that rye bread is an excellent choice for Finland’s national dish. “You can’t get such good rye bread anywhere else in the world, and it’s a traditional food which truly reflects us, made with healthy locally grown ingredients,” he says.<p><p>Alén explains that the characteristic sourness of Finnish rye bread is due to a living leaven that generations of bakers lovingly preserve, repeatedly saving a dollop of residual sourdough as a “root” for future bread batches. “Bakers – like those supplying our restaurants in Helsinki – lovingly cherish this root,” he says. “Dough roots may be well travelled, and a hundred years old or more. This makes rye bread truly symbolic of the history of Finnish food culture now we’re reaching the centenary of our independence.”<p><p>Alén especially loves warm rye bread fresh from the oven generously spread with salted butter, though he also recommends serving it with salted salmon, liver paté or fish soup.<p><p>Karelian pasties, also known as Karelian pies, were in the top three when Finland voted on a national food.Photo: Jani Kärppä/Visit Finland<p><p>As the experts drew up the shortlist, they excluded popular but more local dishes, such as reindeer from Lapland in the north; fish loaf from Savo, a region in the east; and black sausage from Tampere. Two nationally popular dishes from Karelia, another eastern area, nevertheless made the grade, with the second-place dish Karelian stew proving particularly popular among older Finns, and Karelian pasties attracting votes from young Finns.<p><p>The top five national dishes also include pea soup – traditionally eaten on Thursdays – and fried fish (typically Baltic herring in coastal Finland and vendace in Finnish lake country) served with mashed potatoes.<p><p>People pick the bilberries, or blueberries, that grow wild in the woods all over Finland and bake them in pies.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>The highest-rated sweet dish was bilberry pie (“bilberry” is the British name for a type of blueberry that is smaller than the North American variety and grows wild in the Finnish woods). “This is a perfect choice for our national dessert,” says Alén. “It’s a well-loved dish that Finnish families like to make themselves at home – especially in late summer when everyone can go out into the forests and freely pick bilberries to use fresh or freeze.”<p><p>Kurunmäki reckons that the eternal popularity of bilberry pie also reflects current trends favouring local food and wild food. Food scientists have rated Finnish bilberries a natural superfood, bursting with healthy vitamins and minerals.<p><p>“To reflect our pride in all of Finland’s traditional foods throughout our big anniversary year, we’ll be spotlighting each of the 12 shortlisted foods for one celebratory month,” says Kurunmäki. Future goals include “initiating an annual national day of Finnish food culture to be celebrated on Finnish Culture Day, February 28.” In 2017, the Finnish culinary world plays up a special Finland 100 theme on February 28: Rye Day.<p><p>Each of the 12 shortlisted foods in the Finnish national food contest gets its own spotlight month in 2017<p><p>By Fran Weaver, February 2017<p><p> <p><p>Roots as old as Finland<p><p>Truly nationwide favourites<p><p>Don’t forget dessert<p><p>Fair is fair in Finnish food<p>", "time": "2017-02-24T07:13:47+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Endangered Finnish seals get winter help from locals - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/endangered-finnish-seals-get-winter-help-from-locals/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Snow falls gently on the frozen surface of Lake Saimaa, the country’s largest lake, as a blue dawn breaks over eastern Finland. Mikko Uimonen grabs a broad snow shovel known as a “snow pusher” and uses it to pile up deep snowdrifts by the rocky lakeshore.<p><p>At first it’s hard to imagine why anyone should take on such a herculean task, but Uimonen and his fellow volunteers are working for a good cause: they’re helping the Saimaa ringed seals, endangered freshwater seals that live in the labyrinth of bays and islands that make up the lake. Their total population is estimated at 360.<p><p>As breeding season approaches, the workers are piling up man-made snowdrifts in which the seals can make dens to raise their pups. During winters with little snow, pup mortality rates can rise steeply.<p><p>In late January more than a hundred snow-shovelling volunteers work at locations around the vast frozen lake. Most of them are locals, like Uimonen, dedicated to helping their aquatic mammalian neighbours. “To help the seals, all you need is a shovel and plenty of energy,” he says. “It’s rewarding to think that by doing this we can help preserve Lake Saimaa’s seals for future generations.”<p><p>Mikko Uimonen (right) and his brother, Esa, push snow off the frozen surface of the lake to help provide for the Saimaa ringed seals.Photo: Mikko Nikkinen<p><p>Uimonen piles up further layers of snow on the new man-made snowdrift, occasionally beating the surface to make it harden before adding the next layer. The seals need snowdrifts almost a metre (39 inches) deep for their winter dens. Because of climate change, suitable natural snowdrifts have been in short supply during recent winters, so the seals need a helping hand from willing volunteers.<p><p>It’s not worth piling up snowdrifts just anywhere on the lake. Anyone keen to help must contact the experts at Parks &amp; Wildlife Finland, a division of Metsähallitus (literally “forest administration”). They coordinate this work, assisted by the University of Eastern Finland and WWF Finland.<p><p>The artificial snowdrifts have been well used by the seals. In the winter of 2014, when there was very little snow, they proved crucial for the breeding seals, since more than 90 percent of the pups born that winter were raised in dens in the man-made snow piles. “The seals don’t mind at all whether the snowdrifts are natural or man-made,” says Uimonen.<p><p>In recent times more than 60 seals have been born each year. The number jumped to 86 in 2016, but only time will tell whether that was an anomaly or the beginning of a trend.<p><p>Warmer weather will eventually arrive, and when it does you may see a Saimaa ringed seal basking on a rock, showing off the pattern of its pelt.Photo: Teuvo Juvonen/ Vastavalo/VisitFinland<p><p>Lake Saimaa has been important to Mikko Uimonen throughout his life: “Ever since my childhood I’ve always lived just a stone’s throw from the lake. As a small boy I often went out fishing with my dad and my uncles. I first encountered the lake seals on those trips.”<p><p>In the 1990s Uimonen made many long winter ski treks on the lake, pulling his survival gear on a sled behind him. On one of these treks he first met the well-known nature documentarist, writer and photographer Juha Taskinen. Much of Taskinen’s work has focused on Lake Saimaa and its wildlife – especially its unique seals. The tales Taskinen tells have made a deep impression on Uimonen.<p><p>“His stories have really inspired me,” he says. “It’s fantastic that we have a great lake like this – and such special seals to share it with. We’re really privileged to be able to live here.”<p><p>After these encounters Uimonen volunteered to help out with research conducted by the University of Eastern Finland examining the behaviour of Saimaa’s seals. He has assisted the scientists with many practical issues, enabling them to concentrate on their research.<p><p>“Though Saimaa’s ringed seals have been studied quite a lot, they’re still enigmatic animals, and there’s a lot about their underwater world that we don’t fully understand,” he says.<p><p>A group of ski trekkers crosses part of Lake Saimaa, pulling their gear on sleds behind them.Photo: Mikko Nikkinen/VisitFinland<p><p>For Uimonen, who works as a firefighter, Lake Saimaa most of all represents a place to relax and forget any worries. “Though I know the lake quite well, it’s still full of surprises,” he says. “It has so many little bays and inlets that even a whole lifetime isn’t enough to explore them all.”<p><p>He particularly likes to explore Lake Saimaa during the winter. “It’s so tranquil here in wintertime. There’s usually no one on the ice except for the odd skier or fisherman – and the colours of nature are simple and pure, with white snow, clear ice and dark grey rocks. I find it deeply moving.”<p><p>Uimonen doesn’t seem to mind the biting wind and the way the bitter cold infiltrates and freezes your fingers. “Those sensations make you feel really alive!” he says with a laugh.<p><p>The pale midwinter sun is sinking towards the horizon by the time Uimonen and his mates stop piling up the snowdrifts. But this isn’t the end of the project. When winter starts turning to spring, Uimonen goes round the potential breeding den sites to count how many of them have been occupied – and how many new pups have been raised safely thanks to the volunteers’ work.<p><p>Finland’s largest lake, Europe’s fourth largest Total area about 4,400 square kilometres Located in eastern Finland Made up of many interconnected areas of open water, channels and bays Dotted with thousands of islands and islets<p><p>By Tiina Suomalainen, February 2017<p><p>Giving nature a helping hand<p><p>Local pride in the lake and its wildlife<p><p>Deeply moving winter wonders<p><p>Lake Saimaa – a uniquely labyrinthine lake system<p>", "time": "2017-02-21T07:48:51+00:00", "type": "life"}

Will they take time off to care for elderly parents? Maybe they will get lazy and sit in a pub.<p><p>“To be honest, we don’t know. But now we will at least get some evidence.”<p><p>Kangas is the director of community and governmental relations at the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, known by its Finnish abbreviation, Kela. He is leading a unique experiment as Finland tests basic income, a revolutionary form of social security. The goal is to determine if employment can be increased, poverty reduced and the traditional social security system simplified.<p><p>The classic definition of basic income is a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all individuals, without means testing or work requirements. Finland’s experiment does not meet some of these points. For one, it is only available to unemployed persons. The net sum is 560 euros per month, below the official poverty income rate of 1,190 euros. Also, participants can still receive benefits from other programs.<p><p>Going somewhere: Finland is the first nation to put this type of basic-income experiment into action.Photo: Riitta Supperi/Keksi<p><p>“Remember, this is an experiment,” says Aleksi Neuvonen of the Nordic think-tank Demos Helsinki. “No, it doesn’t fit the theory but it is still basic income. I am very excited and proud that Finland is the first country to really try this. An experiment can fail, but at least we have the courage to try.”<p><p>Prime Minister Juha Sipilä promised to conduct a basic-income experiment, but the plan was plagued by problems. The idea is extremely politicised and technically difficult to implement with existing systems. Moreover, the courts considered shutting it down because it could violate the Finnish Constitution, which guarantees everyone equal treatment. Yet the experiment still managed to pass all these roadblocks.<p><p>The authorities decided to focus on unemployed people to see if basic income would encourage them to work. In some cases people were in a “welfare trap” where if they took a part time job they would lose their benefits. Previously they had an incentive not to work, but with basic income they will keep their benefits whether they work or not.<p><p>“This will give us a more realistic understanding of behaviour when the incentive structure changes,” Neuvonen explains. “Young people in particular seem to be very adaptable when incentives change.”<p><p>“The decisions are in the hands of the politicians,” says Olli Kangas, leader of the research group that prepared the report on how to approach and implement the basic-income experiment.Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>The current program is only a small trial, but authorities would like to see it expand in the future.<p><p>“It could be expanded to other groups like freelancers and the self-employed,” says Kangas. “Furthermore, it would be necessary to experiment with a taxation model that would cover the costs. The present experiment is based on the current tax system and in order for the model to be cost-neutral we would need to have higher taxes. Maybe in 2019 there could be such an experiment, and we could also include a negative income tax. The decisions are in the hands of the politicians.”<p><p>Although we have two years before we learn if the basic income can have a positive impact, simply conducting the experiment broke new ground.<p><p>“This is a new way to develop policy,” says Neuvonen. “This is not just ideas or ideological arguments. It is evidence-based and could greatly change how decisions are made.”<p><p>By David J.

{"title": "Pea soup tradition is weekly #TBT passion in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/pea-soup-tradition-is-weekly-tbt-passion-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Any regular at lunch places in Finland knows what to expect on Thursdays: pea soup is included on the menu. It looks thick and mushy, and, frankly, not all that appetising. However, this mundane dish boasts a grand pedigree. The secret behind its popularity lies in national traditions.<p><p>Pea soup goes way back in Finnish culinary history. According to Arja Hopsu-Neuvonen, development manager at Martat, a Finnish home economics organisation founded in 1899, pea soup may have played a part in Northern culinary circles as early as the Middle Ages.<p><p>“It has been discovered that a dish resembling pea soup was already being cooked during the Greek antiquity,” Hopsu-Neuvonen says. “Over time, various forms of the soup developed in different parts of Europe, with different styles of seasoning. The recipe arrived in Finland via Sweden, as so many dishes did.” (You’ll find a recipe in the links section below.)<p><p>Finns love this stuff: (from left) dark rye bread with butter; a bowl of pea soup with ham, onions and mustard; and a tube of Finnish mustard in case you need more.Photo: Mari Storpellinen<p><p>Traditionally consisting of peas with pork shank, onion and mustard, pea soup has several variations. Some cooks like to add carrots, others cream and minced meat. It’s often accompanied by dark Finnish rye bread with butter. Pea soup remains connected with Thursdays, at least in lunch restaurants. In Finnish homes, that’s not necessarily the case.<p><p>“During the working week, Monday is actually the day when the most pea soup is sold in stores,” says Jussi Mannila, assortment manager at SOK Corporation, owned by a group of retailing cooperatives.<p><p>“As far as seasons go, January and February are the time of the year when it clearly sells in larger volumes,” Mannila says.<p><p>That is most likely due to the approach of Lent. The history of pea soup in Finland is closely connected with the arrival of Christianity.<p><p>“Preparing pea soup on Thursdays stems from the fasting orders of the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages,” says Hopsu-Neuvonen. “Eating heavily on Thursday helped Catholics get through the fasting day on Friday.”<p><p>In 1965, eating pea soup for lunch on Thursdays was already a long-standing Finnish tradition in restaurants and in school cafeterias like this one.Photo: Pertti Jenytin/Lehtikuva<p><p>The S Group (the parent company behind SOK Corporation), Martat and the Finnish Literature Society are compiling a book about Finnish cuisine, in honour of Finland celebrating its 100th year of independence next year. In honour of Finland’s national epic, Kalevala, the book is called Ruoka-Kalevala (Food Kalevala). Naturally, pea soup is featured there, too – after all, it is a staple dish everywhere in Finland.<p><p>However, certain areas are even more fond of it than others.<p><p>“Pea soup sells in larger numbers in eastern and northern Finland, while in the southern or western parts it’s not quite so popular,” Mannila says. “All in all, there are no signs of its popularity waning.”<p><p>With Finland’s chilly winters, it makes sense. Who doesn’t love a bowl of hot soup on a cold winter’s day?<p><p>Thick slices of oven-baked pancake are served for dessert, topped with strawberry jam. (The tea towel, called “Metsäpolku” (forest path), is designed by Marja Rautiainen for Lapuan Kankurit.)Photo: Mari Storpellinen<p><p>Usually, pea soup is followed by a thick, oven-made pancake topped with jam. The pancake dough is baked on an oven tray, then cut into rectangular pieces – a truly sweet way to finish off the meal.<p><p>Hopsu-Neuvonen confirms that this combination of main course and dessert also meets today’s guidelines for a nutritious meal.<p><p>“However, since both dishes are very rich in protein, it would be ideal to accompany pea soup with a dessert that is a little bit lighter,” she says. “But if the temptation of a pancake proves too strong, then instead of strawberry jam, fresh or frozen berries would provide a better topping.”<p><p>By Mari Storpellinen, December 2016<p><p>Pre-Lent filler<p><p>Cold-climate favourite<p><p>Sweet follow-up<p>", "time": "2017-01-04T11:52:13+00:00", "type": "life"}

The 100-year mark offers a chance for people to look back to understand the way the nation emerged, but also to gaze ahead to the future to see what Finland can still become.<p><p>Starting in 1809 and up to independence, Finland formed an autonomous grand duchy in the Russian Empire. This proved to be an important time for laying the societal and administrative groundwork that allowed the Finns to break with Russia in 1917. Before 1809, the area that is now Finland had been under Swedish rule since at least the 13th century.<p><p>Creating Finland was and continues to be a group effort.Photo: Suvi-Tuuli Kankaanpää/Finland 100<p><p>The theme for the celebratory year is “Together,” showing that everyone – Finns and friends of Finns – is welcome to take part, just as creating and building the nation were joint efforts.<p><p>At two o’clock on December 5, the day before Independence Day, people all over Finland have coffee and cakes together in anticipation of the holiday. Celebrations officially kick off the evening of December 5, when Helsinki’s Market Square becomes illuminated in a blue-and-white light show. The same day, large and small parties get under way at libraries, concert halls, schools, town squares and, yes, even karaoke bars, all over the country.<p><p>On December 6, flags fly high and the concerts and parades continue, and a multicultural Independence Day celebration takes place at Finlandia Hall in Helsinki, with First Lady Jenni Haukio acting as the honorary guardian of the festivities. She has time to make it back to the Presidential Palace by evening for the annual televised Independence Day Reception. The assembled dignitaries, a couple thousand of them, line up and shake hands with the presidential couple on the way into the hall.<p><p>Ice is for hockey – or is it for ice swimming in the freezing water underneath? In Finland you can do both.Photo: Juha Metso/Finland 100<p><p>Below is a sampling of the centenary events and projects, large and small, happening in the run-up to Independence Day. They emphasise Finnish strengths such as equality and democracy, and of course sisu, that special Finnish blend of courage and endurance.<p><p>New passport design: In 2017, Finnish passports and ID cards gained a new look with artwork portraying the landscape of Finnish Lapland, the Northern Lights, and snowflakes.<p><p>#suomikuvahaaste (Finland photo challenge): From November 6 to December 6, 2017, a social media studio called Piilotettu aarre (Hidden Treasure) is encouraging people to post Finland-related pictures using the hashtag #suomikuvahaaste (Finland photo challenge), with a different theme each day: childhood, nature, music, language, happiness and design, to name a few (more info at this link – scroll down for English version).<p><p>Indigenous Heritage 2017: Helsinki University hosts a conference that examines the concept of heritage as it appears in indigenous peoples’ languages and thinking, as well as intangible and tangible cultural heritage, on November 16 and 17.<p><p>The Life of Art: This exhibition at Kunsthalle Helsinki displays different phases of Finnish art from the 1820s to the 1990s. The artworks come from the collection of financial services and insurance concern Sampo Group, and therefore many of them are rarely seen in public. Helene Schjerfbeck and Akseli Gallen-Kallela are among the many famous names included in the show (November 25–December 31).<p><p>World-renowned Finnish conductor Susanna Mälkki leads the Helsinki Philharmonic.Photo: Chris Lee<p><p>What does Finland sound like? Poems and music: In a centenary concert at Helsinki’s Music Centre on December 1, actors Krista Kosonen and Hannu-Pekka Björkman take the stage with star conductor Susanna Mälkki and the Helsinki Philharmonic to “reflect the national identity in verse and melodies.”<p><p>Hockey – Helsinki Ice Challenge: As Finland turns 100, Helsinki’s main ice hockey clubs are also celebrating big birthdays: HIFK is 120 years old, while Jokerit is just 50. The teams are marking their own anniversaries and that of Finland’s independence by playing outdoors in Kaisaniemi Park downtown. They’re not facing each other, though – their crosstown rivalry was put on ice in 2014 when Jokerit joined the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). So Jokerit plays against SKA St Petersburg on December 2, while HIFK faces Kärpät, from the northern Finnish city of Oulu, on December 5. Dress warmly.<p><p>100 Finnish photographers: Until December 2, one Finnish photographer is in focus each day at Kauppakatu 5 in the central Finnish city of Jyväskylä and on the event website, where you can see all of them at once. Discover or rediscover the work of photographic artists such as Nayab Ikram, Viivi Huuska, Sami Kero, Karoliina Paatos, Jari Silomäki, Minna Havukainen and 94 more.<p><p>Travelling sauna: Readers of The New Yorker discovered that the October 2, 2017 issue of the magazine contained an article entitled “The Finnish obsession with sweating.” Anna Russell wrote about Risto Sivula, a transplanted Finn who now makes his home in Minnesota. In honour of Finland’s 100th anniversary, he has hooked a trailer that is also a sauna to his pickup truck and toured the US, giving people a chance to try an important aspect of Finnish life. With about 60 stops in 24 states from coast to coast, the schedule culminates from December 2 to 6 in Washington, DC, outside the Finnish embassy. At the time of writing there are still slots available for would-be sauna-goers.<p><p>This is just a smattering of what’s happening to commemorate 100 years of Finnish independence. Other events during the year have included tango, samba, snow castles, hackathons, silent films, an arctic expo, a project to involve refugees in startup businesses, Finnish wine from France, and a Finland 100 satellite taking photos of the Northern Lights from space. They have even released a Finland 100 menu, complete with recipes.

And during that trip ten years ago, my mother-in-law asked me, “What do you like most about Finland?”<p><p>I told her I loved its simplicity. But instead of nodding approvingly, my mother-in-law’s eyebrows rose. She looked terribly offended; I assured her that I wasn’t criticising the people.<p><p>This Nordic country, I explained, impressed me with its abundance of simple treasures. With saunas; summer cottages; “baby boxes” full of supplies for new parents; and Everyman’s Right, which gives everyone permission to roam the forests and countryside; Finland is a nation where people know how to live well by living simply.<p><p>Before moving from Boston to Finland in 2013, I had heard the glowing reports about Finnish schools and I predicted – since Finland was internationally recognised as an education superpower – that I’d discover expensive, flashy ingredients to explain the success of its students on international standardised tests like the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).<p><p>[Editor’s note: The PISA 2015 results were released on December 6, 2016 (Finnish Independence Day, by the way) at noon Finnish time. Finnish 15-year-old students once again scored near the top of the standings in all categories of the triennial survey: In scientific literacy, the focus for PISA 2015, the Finns placed third among OECD countries and fifth overall among the 73 participating countries and economies. Finnish students are also still among the best in reading literacy, placing second among OECD countries and fourth overall. In mathematical literacy Finland shares seventh place among OECD countries with Denmark, and came in thirteenth overall.]<p><p>But when I began a two-year stint as a primary-school teacher in Helsinki, what I found surprised me. I developed a six-letter acronym to describe the key features of Finnish education. It’s SIMPLE: Sensible, Independent, Modest, Playful, Low-stress and Equitable.<p><p>This class activity involves moving words across the screen into different categories according to parts of speech.Photo: Riku Isohella/Velhot<p><p>Finland does many sensible things that promote student wellbeing. For instance:<p><p>Students in Finland enjoy a great deal of freedom and independence.Photo: Liisa Takala<p><p>When I moved to Helsinki, I was shocked to find young children navigating the city’s streets without chaperones. At my school, I witnessed something similar. Primary-school students often walked the hallways without the guidance of teachers, served themselves hot food in the lunchroom, and exited the school on their own – things I hadn’t observed in my home country.<p><p>Inside Finnish classrooms, I noticed that many teachers seemed comfortable providing students with ample freedom, such as assigning open-ended projects. Not only did this practice seem to encourage creativity, but it also nudged students to develop stronger critical thinking skills.<p><p>Furthermore, Finland’s well-prepared teachers are world-famous for being trusted as professionals who enjoy significant leeway in their classrooms. (Research suggests that teacher autonomy is linked with happiness at work and retaining educators in the teaching profession.)<p><p>Finland’s well-prepared teachers enjoy significant independence in running their classes.Photo: Riitta Supperi/Keksi/Team Finland<p><p>When I moved to Finland, I expected to find the latest pedagogical methods, a surplus of classroom technologies and sparkling school facilities. It’s what “the world’s best school system” would offer its teachers and students, I reasoned.<p><p>But when I visited different Finnish schools, I generally didn’t find those ingredients. And I’ve since concluded that novel pedagogies, tech gadgets and shiny facilities are nice, but they’re secondary. What’s most important, Finland suggests, is a well-balanced curriculum taught by proficient educators in a learning environment that promotes student wellbeing. <p><p>A learning environment that promotes student wellbeing is one of the most important factors in a good education.Photo: Liisa Takala<p><p>In Finland, there’s a widespread belief among parents and teachers that young children need lots of time to play on a regular basis. Research supports this philosophy, too: “In the short and long term, play benefits cognitive, social, emotional and physical development,” according to an American research summary entitled The Power of Play.<p><p>In fact, most children in Finland don’t begin first grade until they’re seven years old, and before then, they spend most of their school days learning through play.<p><p>But even when Finnish children enter first grade, the structure of the school day provides young students with plenty of opportunities to play. Specifically, most first- and second-graders in Finland, on average, only have about three hours of classroom instruction every day, interspersed with short recesses. And it’s common that, once their school day ends in the early afternoon, Finland’s first- and second-graders attend an after-school club where they typically engage in lots of self-directed play.<p><p>Quiet, relaxed learning environments help create a low-stress experience.Photo: Liisa Takala<p><p>On my visits to different Finnish schools, I started to notice a pattern: the learning environments were generally quiet and relaxed. Since stress has adverse effects on learning and teaching, a low-stress atmosphere at school is vital for everyone – educators and students.<p><p>All schools in Finland are public, with the exception of a tiny handful of independent schools, which means that high standards for teaching and learning are widespread. In other words, no matter where in Finland children grow up, they have free access to good schools with skilled teachers, a balanced curriculum, healthy lunches and high-quality learning materials.<p><p>Finland’s educational arrangement is simply good for kids.<p><p>By Tim Walker, December 2016<p><p>Tim Walker is an American teacher and writer whose books are Lost in Finland (2016, S&amp;S) and Teach Like Finland: 33 Simple Strategies for Joyful Classrooms (April 2017, W.W.

Although Löyly, Allas Sea Pool and Culture Sauna are ambitious in design, they show respect for the surrounding landscape while inviting visitors to connect with the chilly Baltic Sea and the scalding steam of the sauna.<p><p>Löyly (the pronunciation is indescribable – you’ll just have to find a Finn to tell you how to say it) shows off Finnish wood architecture. Designed by Avanto Architects, the low-slung eco-sauna (it was built with timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council) hugs the shoreline in Hernesaari, a former industrial area currently under redevelopment.<p><p>Although made out of wood, Löyly also fits into the rocky coastal landscape.Photo: Karen MacKenna<p><p>The architects wanted to design an organic structure that would eventually blend in with its natural environment. The heat-treated pine slats form protective cover while also providing horizontal windows of light and sea views. In time, the wood will turn grey, the colour of the surrounding rock.<p><p>In Finnish, löyly refers to the steam that rises from hot stones as water is poured over them. The Finns also use the word to refer to the essence of the feeling you experience in the sauna – a kind of spiritual cleansing. You can find out what we mean in Löyly’s two main saunas: a regular wood-burning sauna and a smoke sauna, which leaves a sweet aroma on your skin. Alternating between the two saunas on a crisp day with a chill in the air, a dip in the cool ocean water feels refreshing.<p><p>Men and women share saunas at Löyly, so bathing suits are required – a notable departure from the Finnish sauna tradition of wearing nothing at all. There’s also a restaurant, and champagne flows in the lounge.<p><p>At Allas Sea Pool, you get sauna and swimming in an urban harbour setting.Photo: Karen MacKenna<p><p>Allas Sea Pool is just what its name implies (allas translates to “basin” or “pool”). It offers a uniquely urban public bathing experience in the heart of Helsinki.<p><p>The wooden spa complex, designed by Huttunen-Lipasti-Pakkanen Architects in cooperation with Marinetek Finland, is made of Finnish fir trees and contains saunas, outdoor swimming pools, a floating deck and a recreation centre right on Helsinki harbour.<p><p>Two of the three pools are open year-round, and that makes all the difference. The filtered seawater pool remains at its natural temperature and attracts intrepid swimmers, but two freshwater pools (one of which stays open all winter) are maintained at a comfortable 27 degrees Celcius (80 degrees Fahrenheit).<p><p>From the pool or the deck, you can watch ferry traffic move across the water in front of bustling Market Square. The Presidential Palace and other architectural landmarks are also visible, and the ferris wheel known as the Sky Wheel turns in the background.<p><p>Wood-burning stoves heat two saunas, one on the women’s side and one on the men’s side. To comply with Finnish sauna etiquette, you’re supposed to take your bathing suit off before entering the sauna, in contrast to the unusual bathing-suit rule at Löyly.<p><p>The Helsinki neighbourhood of Kallio is home to Kotiharju (pictured here) and Arla, two public saunas from the 1920s.Photo: Jorma Marstio/ Otavamedia/Lehtikuva<p><p>Dozens of public saunas existed in Helsinki in the early 1900s. People came to these bathhouses to wash in the days before everyone had their own bathroom, and before it became common to equip apartments with their own saunas. A visit to the sauna was also a social occasion.<p><p>Public saunas saw a decline in popularity as incomes and access to private saunas rose. Today, just a few of the older locations remain, reminders of a sense of community that fell by the wayside as times changed.<p><p>Two authentic 1920s saunas still stand in the former working-class neighbourhood of Kallio: Kotiharju and Arla. At the wood-heated Kotiharju (the name means “home ridge”) temperatures are not for the faint of heart. The same goes for Arla, located just a few blocks away. Just a few tram stops farther out, Sauna Hermanni is another old-time Helsinki favourite, recently renovated and redecorated with authentic 1950s furnishings in keeping with the place’s original atmosphere. All three of these locations have separate saunas for women and men.<p><p>The most elegant of the old bathhouses is Yrjönkatu Swimming Hall downtown, also built in the 1920s. It offers a wood-burning sauna, an electric sauna and a steam room. Private booths overlook the beautifully tiled swimming pool flanked by arches two stories tall. With the schedule divided into separate days for men and women, bathing suits are optional.<p><p>Kulttuurisauna (Culture Sauna) offers an intimate, zen-like experience that you can top off with a dip in the sea.Photo: Karen MacKenna<p><p>Helsinki’s current public sauna revival can be traced to Kulttuurisauna (Culture Sauna), which began as a project connected with the city’s year as World Design Capital in 2012 and opened in 2013.<p><p>The first public sauna built in the city in half a century, Culture Sauna’s humble but exquisitely crafted building perches on the water’s edge in front of the concrete structures that make up the Merihaka district. Architect Tuomas Toivonen and artist Nene Tsuboi created a compact, one-story, white building and equipped it with candle-lit rooms and a wood-pellet–fired stove that emits an intense and perfect heat.<p><p>It’s an intimate, zen-like experience that you can top off with a dip in the sea. Although the city is all around you as you swim – in one direction you may glimpse a power plant, and just across the water stands the venerable Kruununhaka neighbourhood – you feel far removed from the busy pace of urban life. A glass of potent sea-buckthorn berry juice forms the ideal post-sauna elixir.<p><p>While the capital city’s public sauna renaissance gives cause for celebration, most Finns will tell you that nothing compares to a secluded sauna in the Finnish wilderness on the shore of a lake or the ocean. If you have the opportunity to visit one, you will come even closer to understanding the Finnish soul.<p><p>By Karen MacKenna, October 2016<p><p>Steam and a sea view<p><p>Harbour swimming<p><p>Urban authenticity prevails<p><p>Cultural sauna connections<p>", "time": "2016-10-27T10:37:12+00:00", "type": "life"}

Dozens of dogs today prick up their ears gratifyingly in response to young readers, though reading to dogs does not form part of the official school curriculum.<p><p>Heidi Puputti, who teaches a special needs class at Hovirinta School, reckons that reading to dogs particularly helps kids to relax and improves their ability to concentrate.<p><p>“Some children may normally be hyperactive in the classroom, but when they read to a dog, they calm down,” she says. “They understand that they are the ones in control of the situation, and that they must consider the needs of the listener. They also learn to be empathic and interactive. And when they read carefully, they notice that they can actually read quite well after all.”<p><p>Special-needs teacher Heidi Puputti (left), Maarit Haapasaari of Hali-Koirat (Hug Dogs) and Hilma the Bernese mountain dog hang out in front of Hovirinta School.Photo: Ilari Välimäki<p><p>A session with a reading dog typically lasts about five minutes, or up to 15 minutes for more advanced readers. The dogs visit the same schools many times, giving kids a chance to enjoy reading to them repeatedly. <p><p>Donita has also read stories to two other Bernese mountain dogs, called Viljo-Valdemar and Neiti Namu (Miss Cutie). “Viljo was really nice,” she says. “He listened very calmly.”<p><p>Bernese mountain dogs are particularly well suited to such tasks, due to their affectionate nature and cuddly appearance, though their large size also gives them a sense of dignity and authority. The breed of the dog is of little importance, though. All reading dogs start training as puppies to accustom them to different settings and people.<p><p>“We also keep in mind that some kids may be a bit afraid of dogs,” says Haapasaari. “The children can decide for themselves how close they want to be to the dog. The reading activity can also help children to overcome a fear of dogs.”<p><p>Maarit Haapasaari brought the reading dog concept to Finland in 2011.Photo: Ilari Välimäki<p><p>Haapasaari provides reading dogs for schools in southwestern Finland through her own business, called Hali-Koirat (Hug Dogs). In addition to being read to, her dogs visit old people’s homes and centres for people with disabilities, to be cuddled and stroked.<p><p>“Together with creative writing specialist Veera Vähämaa, we’ve also developed and registered a concept we call ‘Writing stories to tell to dogs,’” says Haapasaari. “Children write their own stories that they can then read aloud to a dog. This kind of activity isn’t practised anywhere else in the world yet.”<p><p>In the town of Raisio, not far from Kaarina, another business has set up a similar scheme, but the listeners are “reading cows.” Since it’s impractical to bring such listeners into schools and libraries, the kids also get to enjoy a visit to a farm.<p><p>By Matti Välimäki, October 2016<p><p> <p><p>All over Finland<p><p>Affectionate audience<p><p>Canines and even cows encourage creativity<p>", "time": "2016-10-10T06:50:55+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Enabling active ageing in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/enabling-active-ageing-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Active older people are highly visible in Finland at all kinds of social and cultural events, and also in the great outdoors – often whizzing speedily by on skis or bicycles. The over-60 set already makes up 27 percent of the Finnish population, and their numbers are rising rapidly as the post-war baby-boom generation reaches retirement age. Finnish authorities are well aware that the future cost of caring for the country’s burgeoning ageing population represents a significant challenge. However, keeping older people physically active and socially involved can help offer a solution.<p><p>“Here in Finland our population is ageing faster than anywhere else in the world except Japan,” explains Eeva Päivärinta, a social and health services specialist from the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra, where a recently completed two-year programme has focused on the need for services targeting senior citizens. “By 2030 it will be beyond the capacity of our economy to provide fully serviced old people’s homes in line with our traditional elderly care model, so we urgently need to find ways to offer effective online and home-based healthcare and other services for old people living at home.”<p><p>Gardening, whether on a windowsill, on a balcony, or in a yard, is a hobby that keeps mind and body active.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>Average life expectancy for a 60-year-old in Finland is currently 84. Päivärinta emphasises that this longevity should be seen as a gift, though this will only be true if people can enjoy good quality of life in their twilight years. “It’s most important to listen to what old people themselves say they want. Our research shows that in addition to a safety net of residential care places for the neediest, they would greatly appreciate support enabling them to live in their own homes as long as possible.”<p><p>Finland ranked 14th in the 2015 Global Age Watch, an index that tracks the wellbeing of older people. The Finns scored particularly well on income security and enabling environments. According to Päivärinta, the innovatively funded national pension and social security scheme ensures that no pensioners need endure poverty, while the local authorities provide accessible facilities and discounts that make it easy for older people to use public transport, exercise in swimming pools, gyms, and parks, and visit museums, libraries, and theatres.<p><p>“Old people are often also active in Finland’s many local residents’ and pensioners’ associations, enjoying social events and trips – and they’re increasingly getting involved in voluntary schemes where they can meet and help other pensioners or schoolkids,” she adds.<p><p>The Kotisatama cohousing project in Helsinki’s Kalasatama district is not a regular old-people’s home, but a new kind of self-service housing scheme. Residents Maj-Len Törnqvist and Frank Roehr check out the housework rota and forthcoming events on the housing community’s website.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>Municipally subsidised service centres open to all elderly local residents provide a network of meeting places and facilities in Finland’s villages, towns, and suburbs. Some of these buildings also include conventional fully serviced older people’s apartments.<p><p>But Päivärinta still sees a need for new services to help people at home. “In Tampere we have piloted the Palvelutori [Service Market] staffed service-point scheme,” she says. It gives pensioners a central place to find out about all the different kinds of practical help and advice they can get through the health and social services systems and other initiatives. “Many useful services exist, and it’s often just a question of connecting people to them. The scheme has been very popular, and is already being expanded in Tampere and other towns.” In Turku a parallel online service scheme is being piloted in a Sitra-funded project.<p><p>The Finnish housing market must likewise adapt to the greying of the population by providing accessible homes that also meet retired residents’ social needs. Trial schemes where older people are housed together with students have proven helpful to both the youngsters and the oldsters.<p><p>Cohousing schemes, where apartment-owners share common facilities and can socialise in communal spaces, are an attractive option for many older people. In 2015 the association Aktiiviset Seniorit (Active Seniors) opened its second cohousing project, called Kotisatama (Home Port), in Helsinki’s rapidly growing Kalasatama district.<p><p>Kotisatama resident Mari Raunio working the loom in the handicrafts room open to everyone. In the building there is also a small gym, a library and games room, a laundry, a pétanque pitch, a roof garden, and two saunas.Photo: Hernan Patiño<p><p>“Kotisatama is not a normal old people’s home, but a new kind of self-service housing scheme,” explains resident Marjut Helminen. “In addition to looking after our own flats, we residents are grouped in housework teams who take turns cleaning our communal spaces and cooking the meals we can choose to enjoy together every weekday evening. This way of living appeals to people who want to keep control over their own lives, but who also enjoy a sense of community and activities organised together with their neighbours.”<p><p>In addition to 63 pleasant apartments, the totally wheelchair-accessible Kotisatama building has well-equipped shared facilities including a handicrafts and DIY workshop, a small gym, a library and games room, a laundry, a pétanque pitch, a roof garden, and two saunas. In the entrance hall beside Kotisatama’s spacious communal dining room and kitchen, an electronic notice-board shows news about activities, events, and housework shifts.<p><p>“Everyone makes the most of all these facilities, and we have lots of groups for people who share interests from singing, cinema, literature, and IT skills to card games, chess, bowling, and pilates,” says Helminen – who is certainly an active senior herself, as a keen canoeist who has also just published her first novel. Many of Kotisatama’s residents cycle regularly, and some even enjoy winter bathing in a hole in the ice of a nearby ocean bay.<p><p>Everything at Kotisatama has been meticulously planned in advance through the Aktiiviset Seniorit association by the residents themselves, who have an average age of 67 and an age range of 54–80. “Aktiiviset Seniorit has already started to plan its third cohousing scheme, and there’s plenty of interest from future residents,” says Helminen. “There would definitely be a need for many more cohousing schemes like ours – also for rented apartments.”<p><p>“It’s been wonderful to move into a ready-made community of neighbours, like a big family, where you can be on your own if you want, but also always have people to be with,” says Kotisatama resident Maj-Len Törnqvist. “In the future I don’t want to feel like a burden to my children – and they’re also very happy for me that I’ve found this kind of home.”<p><p>By Fran Weaver, August 2016<p><p>Service networks for home-based seniors<p><p>Innovative self-service cohousing<p><p>Planning for an active retirement<p>", "time": "2016-08-03T10:25:34+00:00", "type": "life"}

Photo: Tiina Haring/Keksi<p><p>The Finnish language has a word for “volunteer” (vapaaehtoinen), but there is also a special word talkoot for an event where neighbours, villagers or colleagues get together to help accomplish a large job. This might involve cleaning the grounds around an apartment building, making improvements to a local schoolyard, or even making a music festival possible. Ilosaarirock and dozens of other festivals around the country rely on the living tradition of talkoot to ensure that everything runs smoothly.<p><p>Festival-goers encounter their first volunteers as soon as they arrive at the gateway to the venue. Volunteers are entrusted with responsible tasks including checking the wristbands given to ticket-holders to allow them into the festival, and searching visitors’ pockets and bags for forbidden objects such as knives or alcoholic drinks.<p><p>Ilosaarirock strives to be a green festival, so volunteers also help festival-goers to put different kinds of rubbish in the right recycling and waste containers.<p><p>A volunteer in an orange shirt fastens an Ilosaarirock admission wristband on a plaid-clad festival-goer’s arm.Photo: Tiina Haring/Keksi <p><p>Ilosaarirock has been organised since 1971, making it Finland’s second oldest rock festival.

His regular job involves social work in Helsinki, but his current parental leave has given him time off to do some voluntary work.

{"title": "The root of Finnish rye bread - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/the-root-of-finnish-rye-bread/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finns have long been avid consumers of rye bread. Such is their enthusiasm for this culinary staple that they even take it with them on trips abroad.<p><p>In the summertime Finns head to their summer cottages on the mass in the weekends and during summer holidays. As a result, rural communities around the country often double in size during the warmer months, with this temporary migration giving a considerable boost to the local economies.<p><p>There is one product in particular that these city slickers enthusiastically seek out during their temporary stays that can’t be found on store shelves elsewhere.<p><p>“People are really eager to eat the local rye breads,” explains Johanna Mäkelä, professor of food culture at the University of Helsinki. “I would suspect that some of these local bakeries are surviving just by baking in the summer.”<p><p>Finns have kept rye bread in their hearts and on their tables for thousands of years. It is part of their cultural identity. Nordic Breads maintains a successful stand at a New York City market.Photo: Finnish Ruis Bread<p><p>Such enthusiasm is unsurprising. First cultivated in Finland over 2,000 years ago, rye grain’s adaptability to various soil types, coupled with its ability to ripen over the short northern summer, has long seen it a staple of the local cuisine.<p><p>“Finnish rye bread is a story of a poor country, as there were so few ingredients that were always available,” Mäkelä explains. “Water, leaven, salt and rye flour – that’s still the basic recipe. Sometimes you can also add yeast.”<p><p>Whether it’s the round limppu (loaf) originating from the eastern parts of the country, or the west’s flat disc with a hole in the middle, known as reikäleipä, Finnish full-flavoured rye bread is noticeably lighter than varieties from Germany and the Baltic Region. It is also considerably less sweet than Swedish rye bread, and is commonly enjoyed as a sandwich, dipped in soup or simply by itself, topped with a layer of butter.<p><p>Whichever way you look at it, and whatever shape it comes in, the bond that Finns share with rye bread cannot be overstated.<p><p>“If people come from a different part of Finland and move to Helsinki, they often long for the kind of bread they have eaten in their childhood,” Mäkelä explains. “Also, if you ask almost any Finn going abroad to meet expats, there are two things they would take with them: rye bread and Fazer blue-label chocolate.”<p><p>This coveted bread is even on sale at Helsinki Airport to meet demand. Here travellers can pick up a last-minute gift for their friends and family, or ensure they have enough in stock when spending time outside of the country.<p><p>Traditionally rye bread was baked in a big baking oven made from the household’s own leaven, which was passed down through the generations. Photo: Elina Sirparanta<p><p>Rye bread’s ubiquity over the years has seen it become deeply engrained in Finnish culture. Aside from being referenced in the national epic Kalevala, it also features prominently in paintings and proverbs from earlier ages.<p><p>Farmers once took heed that consuming rye gives one power in the wrists if hard work is required, and the grain was said to provide energising fuel for draught horses. These days, such beliefs have been replaced by scientific evidence underlining various health benefits.<p><p>“Rye has a very high fibre content,” explains Kaisa Poutanen, Research Professor from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. “Even though it’s concentrated in the outer layers of the kernels, the dietary fibre is also found in the inner parts of the grain.”<p><p>This abundant fibre directly aids the intestinal health of consumers. Not to be outdone, the grain also helps to protect from diabetes.<p><p>“When we eat rye bread, we need less insulin to control blood glucose,” Poutanen continues. “Also, cardiovascular disease is very much connected to diabetes. So, if you protect against one, you protect against the other.”<p><p>Last, but certainly not least, the satiating effect of rye bread is widely recognised as being integral for weight management.<p><p>With research continuing to uncover new health benefits, and the number of varieties on offer growing steadily, it’s safe to say that store shelves around the country will be well stocked with the national bread for many years to come.<p><p>“We Finns use rye bread to sustain ourselves and our bodies, but it is also part of our cultural identities,” Mäkelä observes. “We are keeping it in our hearts, but on the other hand we are also keeping it on our tables.”<p><p>“It’s a living tradition.”<p><p>The special leaven, sourdough, used when preparing Finnish rye bread is known as leivän juuri in Finnish, or ‘the root of the bread’.<p><p>“Many households still have their own leaven, which they inherited from previous generations,” explains VTT’s Kaisa Poutanen. “Where I live in Kuopio, a lady has leaven which is over 50 years old that she got from her mother-in-law. She is still baking with it, every week.”<p><p>The trick to preserving leaven is to ensure that some of the bread mix is left over when baking, which can then either be dried or frozen. Next time around all that needs doing is add a little water and the bacteria start to live again. And the cycle continues, ensuring flavoursome bread time and time again.<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, July 2016<p><p>Historic flavour<p><p>Feeling the effects<p><p>Rise of the leaven<p>", "time": "2016-07-12T08:15:52+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Stunted growth, superior quality - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/stunted-growth-superior-quality/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The short Finnish summer and low sun give our produce certain unique features, such as intense flavour and various health properties.<p><p>“Many of the foods produced in Finland are not found anywhere else on the planet. Although the yield obtained from vegetable and fruit produce and animal products can be quite low, the growing conditions can create exceptional quality. As a result, our food plants offer not only intense aromas but also numerous immunity-boosting compounds,” says Professor of Food Chemistry Heikki Kallio from the University of Turku.<p><p>The reason can be found in Finland’s unusual geographical position. The country lies on latitudes which, in places like Canada and Russia, are usually covered by tundra. Finland is “shifted” south by approximately 2,000 km by the Gulf Stream, which warms the whole of Scandinavia. However, the Gulf Stream has no effect on daylight conditions: The Finnish growing seasons are short and punctuated by severe winters. In the summer, the sun is low and days are long. In Lapland above the Arctic Circle, the sun doesn’t set at all during a certain period.<p><p>The warmth of the Gulf Stream combined with the low-intensity daylight and long daylight hours create unique conditions for food growth.<p><p>Each year, Finnish woodlands produce millions of kilos of wild berries. The Finnish bilberry is particularly popular in Japan and South Korea. One of the reasons is its intense colour and flavour.<p><p>Bilberry and certain other berries, such as sea buckthorn, have been found to be beneficial for cardiovascular health. Sea buckthorn oil reduces the coagulation of platelets and dry eye symptoms.<p><p>Sea buckthorn grows from north to south, from Kittilä in Lapland to Turku over 800 km away.Photo: Maarit Perkonoja<p><p>“Sea buckthorn grown in the north contains twice as much vitamin C, one and a half times the amount of sugar, and more phenolic compounds which protect human health. We have also studied sea buckthorn growing at different altitudes in the Himalayas and found that the high-low axis has the same effect on growth as the north-south axis,” Kallio explains.<p><p>In the world of spices, caraway is one of the most profitable crops in Finland.<p><p>“Finnish caraway is in demand around the world due to its high concentration of carvone, which gives caraway its distinct flavour. In the past, we have compared the roots of Angelica archangelica plants grown in different locations. The plant is used to flavour various products, including the Chartreuse liqueur. We found that A. Angelica grown in Inari in Northern Finland was unrivalled in terms of quality, even though the yield was lower. It looks like stunted growth could actually mean superior quality.”<p><p>Helena Puolakka is an international culinary super star, who has worked for various Michelin star restaurants and judged for the Top Chef Finland TV series.

{"title": "Faster, higher, stronger – and free from prejudice - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/faster-higher-stronger-and-free-from-prejudice/", "review": "", "content": "<p>More than 1,500 athletes from around the world are participating in Eurogames Helsinki 2016. While enjoy competing in the Finnish capital they also aim to have lots of fun – and change attitudes.<p><p> Juha Meronen has been mad about sports ever since he was a small boy. “I first started by playing Finnish baseball and even ice hockey – the same games that all young guys played in those days before Playstations existed,” he says.<p><p>Stereotypes about homosexual athletes run deep. As the Co-President of Eurogames Helsinki 2016 Juha Meronen hopes that such events will help to change outdated attitudes. He welcomes the way that active sportspeople from “conventional” clubs have been keen to help organise the games. Photo: Juho Paavola<p><p>Though Meronen never became a top sportsman, his love for sport persisted. At an age when most sports-lovers start to hang up their football boots for good, he just keeps on going. As a longstanding member of the sports club HOT he’s had the chance to try many different sports. Established in 1997, HOT is a Helsinki-based club for gay athletes. Meronen still smashes the occasional winning volley for HOT’s volleyball team, though his main sporting activity these days is a leisurely round of golf.<p><p>In addition to being a keen sportsman Meronen is openly gay. “But your homosexuality isn’t really evident out on the golf course. When I play, I just play – and I don’t try and pick up any of the other golfers,” he laughs.<p><p>In an ideal world no one would have to make such explanations.<p><p>Juha Meronen has taken part in the international Eurogames event for sexual and gender minorities 11 times. This year’s event will be held in his hometown Helsinki at the turn of June and July, with Meronen as the proud Co-President of the games.<p><p>“The sport is the main thing, but nothing will be taken too seriously. Participants range from keen beginners to dedicated athletes who practise every day. It’s really more of a social event – though medals will certainly be awarded,” he says.<p><p>The 16th Eurogames are the first to be held in Finland.Photo: Mika Ruusunen/ EuroGames Helsinki<p><p>The games are being held to coincide with Helsinki’s Pride week. Though many Eurogames athletes will be competing mainly for fun, with a twinkle in their eye, many of the participants coming to Helsinki really mean business.<p><p>“For many participants Eurogames is the only event where they can compete with people like themselves. You don’t have to wonder what the others might be thinking, and for this reason many people take the sport very seriously,” says Meronen.<p><p>Though homosexuality is no longer so frowned upon today in many countries, in the sporting world gay athletes often have to think carefully about whether they dare to come out of the closet. “Prejudices still persist, especially in team sports,” says Meronen. “Some people think that gay players might not play hard enough, or that they would pinch their teammates’ bottoms or stare at them in the shower.”<p><p>The Eurogames event is also giving work to many sports activists from “conventional sports clubs”, as Meronen describes them. Their attitudes have generally been enthusiastic and positive, with a few sorry exceptions. “The chairman of one club asked how they could defend the participation of their junior members in a gay event… This kind of attitude is why we need an event like Eurogames,” explains Meronen.<p><p>About 1,500 people will take part in Eurogames Helsinki 2016, including several transgender athletes, as well as gays and lesbians. “Though we don’t check in any way who is what…” Juha Meronen adds.<p><p>The Eurogames athletes will compete in 14 different sports in Helsinki: athletics, badminton, basketball, bowling, bridge, cross-country running, dancing, floorball, football, golf, squash, swimming, tennis and volleyball.Photo: Mika Ruusunen/ EuroGames Helsinki<p><p>Meronen feels that Finland and Helsinki make a good venue for such an event. Though laws permitting gay marriage were only finally approved in 2015, the situation here is much more favourable than in many other countries. You can even show your feelings toward the person you love on the street without fear of any violent response to your sexual orientation.<p><p>“There’s really been a lot of progress. I think getting equal marriage rights recognised in parliament represented the final defeat for the opponents of gay rights, who were ultimately forced to give in,” he says.<p><p>Though Meronen gives Finns a good overall rating in terms of their tolerance of sexual minorities, he feels there is still some room for improvement. “The whole debate in Finland is still very heteronormative. It’s assumed that everyone should have or want a wife and kids. But this isn’t how everyone is, or what everyone wants,” he says.<p><p>Juha Meronen welcomes the support the organisers have received from the City of Helsinki. The President of Finland Sauli Niinistö is the event’s patron, the Mayor of Helsinki Jussi Pajunen will speak at the opening ceremony, and the city’s sports department has helped to provide facilities and venues, while the Ministry of Education and Culture has provided financial backing.<p><p>Photo: Mika Ruusunen/ EuroGames Helsinki<p><p>“In 2014 the 7,000 participants in the Gay Games held in Cleveland in the USA spent some 35 million dollars in the host city during the games. Helsinki has well understood that with just a little investment up front you can bring in a lot of big spenders,” says Meronen.<p><p>In Helsinki the Eurogames athletes will work up a good sweat, enjoy the thrills of competition, and remind everyone that during most sports events there’s no time or need for players to worry about the sexual orientation of their opponents or teammates.<p><p>Meronen hopes that events like Eurogames will continue to be so successful that one day they will no longer be needed: “Our dream is that gay athletes will feel they can compete freely together with all other athletes. But I think that in 20 years we’ll still be holding Eurogames, because there’s so much fun and socialising involved – and this is important when it comes to sport.”<p><p>During Eurogames Helsinki 2016 (29.6—2.7.2016) everyone is welcome to come and join in the fun at the Eurogames Village at Kansalaistori Square, between Helsinki Central railway station and Helsinki Music Centre.<p><p>By Juho Paavola, June 2016<p><p>Sport for all<p><p>Room for improvement<p><p>The pink money comes to town<p>", "time": "2016-06-29T10:46:39+00:00", "type": "life"}

After overcoming obstacles in integrating, he has become a spokesman for the immigrant population.<p><p>Journalist, interpreter, politician, social pedagogue – Abdirahim “Husu” Hussein is a man of many roles but there is one main reason that he gets out of bed each morning:<p><p>“To make the world a better place,” he declares. “I’m changing one person at a time. But before I change anyone, I change myself; it’s about being a better human being every day. If I find a piece of glass lying on the street I make sure I remove it, so it won’t bother people that are coming after me.”<p><p>This is an apt metaphor for the more than two decades he has lived in Finland.<p><p>Journalist, interpreter, politician and social pedagogue Abdirahim Hussein has gradually emerged as a spokesman for the immigrant population in Finland since arriving here from Mogadishu 22 years ago. Photo: James O’Sullivan<p><p>Hussein has gradually emerged as a spokesman for the immigrant population here since arriving from Mogadishu as a teenager. Not content with being a passive newcomer, he remains adamant that regardless of age, country of birth, religion, mother tongue or profession, everyone in Finland must be treated as individuals.<p><p>Back in 1994, settling into life in the Turku region posed a considerable challenge for Hussein. Then, Finland was emerging from an economic depression, with its homogeneous population ill-prepared for integrating the refugees that had begun arriving on its doorstep.<p><p>It didn’t help that society’s minority fringe began loudly channelling their misguided frustrations in the direction of these newcomers.<p><p>Yet, in the face of such adversity, Hussein saw his new country of residence as a land of opportunity.<p><p>Almost everything you needed was here, as long as you were a part of the system,” he recalls. “Coming from a place that never had this, it was a shock – studying for free, getting medical for free, having a house and rights, and being able to speak your mind without being prosecuted.”<p><p>According to Abdirahim Hussein, the key to getting his own voice heard and landing his first job was to speak Finnish. It was not an easy path, but it was worth it.Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Hussein quickly realised he would first have to speak the local language before his own voice would be heard.<p><p>“I learned Finnish more by talking and having friends and reading books than going to class,” he recalls. “But it was a very hard process; it is still very difficult to master the language.”<p><p>Hussein’s linguistic skills helped him to land his first job, a summer post for students caring for the elderly. It was eye-opening for him to see society’s oldest members left in the care of others, in contrast to the family-orientated community that he grew up in.<p><p>Whilst some might find such cultural differences difficult to reconcile, Hussein nonetheless was determined to be an active member of society, eventually adding kitchen hand, waiter, cleaner, salesman and taxi driver to his resume, and going on to study social sciences at university.<p><p>Much of Hussein’s success is attributable to his headstrong approach. However, when looking at his fellow immigrants, it was clear that not all were integrating as well as he. Hussein recognised that he had to do something about this.<p><p>“If you want to make the world a better place, the first thing you have to have is some kind of political power,” he says.<p><p>Hussein entered the political arena in 2005 as a member of the Centre Party. Setting out to show that there was a place for everyone in Finland, Hussein emphasised that he, like his fellow “new Finns,” could also not be easily categorised. Alongside being an African, he was also a Muslim, a father, a heterosexual and a meat eater – not merely an “immigrant.”<p><p>Hussein subsequently found another prominent avenue for engaging the public in lively discussion, teaming up with comic Ali Jahangiri for the weekly radio programme Ali ja Husu (Ali and Husu). Approaching Finnish society and phenomena from the immigrant perspective, the duo filled the nationwide airwaves with humour and insight for 3 and a half years, before eventually stepping away from the mic in 2016.<p><p>Meanwhile, Hussein has remained active in numerous community projects. Perhaps the most notable of these is Moniheli, the immigrant-run NGO he cofounded, which brings multicultural organisations together to further their interests.<p><p>The ways of integrating immigrants to Finnish society have changed a lot since Husu Hussein came to Finland in the 1990s. Here immigrant children are getting familiar with winter and snow by taking part in cross-country skiing lessons. Photo: Otto Ponto<p><p>He has also begun expanding his sphere of influence by helping to export Finnish knowhow, bringing local goods and services to East Africa as a junior consultant for Finnish Consulting Group.<p><p>And so, amidst this tireless trailblazing, one wonders what Hussein does to unwind, exactly.<p><p>“My family relaxes me the most,” he says without hesitation. “I don’t have the luxury of taking them around the world, but we are happy with what we have.”<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, June 2016<p><p>The amount of people seeking asylum in Finland increased enormously in 2015, from 3,651 in 2014 to 32,476 in 2015.

In 2015, asylum applications were processed, on average, in 284 days. There are over 21,000 applications under way at the time of writing, so it is impossible to predict how long the processing will take in the future.<p><p>In 2015, according to the Finnish Immigration Service, a total of 7,466 decisions were made concerning asylum seekers. 1,628 seekers were granted asylum, 251 other residence permit, 1,094 were refused.

One needs only witness the panic in a Finn’s eyes when they step into a crowded elevator to get a sense of how much elbowroom is appreciated here up north. Then, of course, there’s the wide, comfortable gap that exists between people waiting silently at the bus stop each morning.<p><p>Yet, somewhat puzzlingly, it’s a different story altogether once Finns are inside a sauna. Here, it’s perfectly okay to be huddled together on a bench, chatting openly with your sweaty companions.<p><p>Imagine then the level of social comfort when this cultural experience is shared by a couple of hundred strangers at the same time.<p><p>This is exactly what’s on offer at the world’s largest sauna.<p><p>Nearly twice the size of its nearest rival, the world’s biggest sauna is the latest in a long line of eccentric ideas from Vapaateekkarit. They are used to having sauna wearing a traditional technical student cap with the tassel.Photo: Mikko Autio<p><p>Located on the grounds of Aalto University, in the Espoo suburb of Otaniemi, a 310-square-metre mega sauna is being heated every night of the week leading up to the annual May 1 celebrations, called vappu in Finnish.<p><p>The sauna’s centrepiece is a colossal wood stove, known as kiuas in Finnish. Measuring some four metres tall and weighing around four tonnes, this towering heap of stones is not only responsible for the heat filling the cavernous space, but it also represents the starting point of the project.<p><p>The wood stove, known as kiuas in Finnish, stands at a height of some four metres and weighs around four tonnes.Photo: Mikko Autio<p><p>Technical student organisation Vapaateekkarit came up with this significantly sized use for the stove only a few weeks ago. The spark arrived after shopping centre Ideapark Lempäälä agreed to lend it to them momentarily before it’s handed over to a local scout group.<p><p>“We thought that if we are going to have the largest kiuas here, of course we are going to make the biggest sauna ever,” explains Vapaateekkarit’s Nicolas Saulny. After construction company Ramirent stepped in to provide the sauna’s steel frame, the student group took care of the rest.<p><p>“It was all done by volunteers,” Saulny says. “We built the basic structure in five days. It was crazy. Some people did 24-hour shifts just to create a unique sauna experience for everybody.”<p><p>Unique is an appropriate word. The sauna is nearly double the size of the current Guinness World Record holder, a 166-square-metre hot box located in Sinsheim, Germany. However, whilst undeniably proud of having returned the Finnish invention to its birthplace in such a significant manner, Saulny insists that the project also has another goal.<p><p>“If we break the world record that would be awesome, but the most important thing is that people have fun,” he exclaims.<p><p>Such enthusiastic pursuit of joy is a trait shared by many a university student, yet, Vapaateekkarit’s technical prowess evidently takes it to a whole different level.<p><p>After the sauna is dismantled, the huge wooden stove is going to be delivered to a local scout group.Photo: James O´Sullivan<p><p>“A couple of years ago we cut the top off a car and built a Jacuzzi inside,” Saulny enthuses. “We could drive around while having a Jacuzzi and the car engine warmed the water. We just want to make fun projects.”<p><p>Indeed. Here inside their latest achievement, long wooden benches line three of the four walls, a giant disco ball hangs overhead and Finnish classic tunes blare from the speakers. An old piano is even situated on the sauna floor, not far from the roaring kiuas.<p><p>“It’s getting warm in here,” declares Joni Virkki, a volunteer who is hard at work feeding wood into the stove and ladling water over the hot stones. Virkki’s role is that of ‘sauna major’, the keeper of the kiuas that is looming over him. Toiling tirelessly in the heat, he mops his brow at increasingly regular intervals.<p><p>A growing number of sauna-goers are similarly working up a sweat. Some chat amongst themselves. Others wear a bemused smile on their face as they take in the vast room.<p><p>“There’s been lots of positive feedback,” Saulny states, pointing out that many exchange students have also enthusiastically embraced this upsized take on the Finnish tradition. “They have really loved the experience.”<p><p>And so, in light of such a considerable achievement, one wonders just what will happen to Vapaateekkarit’s creation after this week.<p><p>“We are going to demolish everything and it’s over,” Saulny says, with little remorse. “Will we do this every year? No, I don’t think so. We like to make new and fresh projects and because this is already done we have to consider another possibilities in the near future. As they say: Stay tuned!”<p><p>With that it’s time for Saulny to go back to work, busying himself with carrying in water and wood, and welcoming guests. The music suddenly cuts out for a moment, as he takes the microphone to make an announcement:<p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen, we also have a nice warm Jacuzzi outside.”<p><p>The sauna has been constructed on the grounds of Aalto University, situated about nine kilometres from the Helsinki city centre in the Espoo suburb of Otaniemi.

{"title": "Finland top-rated for press freedom - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finland-top-rated-for-press-freedom/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The World Press Freedom Index for 2016 gives Finland top ranking for the seventh year running.<p><p>Published annually by the Paris-based organisation Reporters without Borders, the World Press Freedom Index ranks 180 countries using criteria on the independence and pluralism of the media, the transparent flow of information, legal frameworks, and the safety and freedom of journalists.<p><p>The 2016 rankings show Finland in first place again. UNESCO’s choice to hold this year’s World Press Freedom Day event in Helsinki on May 2-4, also reflects the reputation of Finland’s free press.<p><p>“We’re proud to be so highly rated in this influential index, which is widely respected by international organisations,” says Ilkka Nousiainen, Chairperson of the Finnish branch of Reporters without Borders, which was set up in 2013 by Finnish journalists interested in press freedom at home and around the world.<p><p>Nousiainen believes Finland’s top rating is largely due to the high levels of freedom enjoyed by journalists in their everyday work. “Our journalists can write freely without interference from media owners or the government,” he says. “We also have very effective laws and institutions in place to help guarantee press freedom.”<p><p>One key organisation is Finland’s Council for Mass Media (CMM), which is jointly run by media publishers and the national journalists’ union to defend freedom of speech while also ensuring good journalistic practice and dealing with complaints through self-regulation.<p><p>CMM’s Chairperson Elina Grundström emphasises that long-standing Finnish legislation supports the freedom of the press by promoting transparency. “The Act on the Openness of Government Activities means all kinds of official documents are by default publicly available, except for very few documents justifiably designated as secret,” she says.<p><p>Ilkka Nousiainen agrees that Finnish journalists appreciate this openness – which even extends to the tax payment records of individual citizens – as well as the relative approachability of Finnish politicians and business figures. He feels the mainstream media are suitably objective, critical and diverse, even if the public broadcasting company YLE and the leading national daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat sometimes seem to have a dominant role in shaping public opinion.<p><p>Grundström also appreciates the plurality of the Finnish media: “I don’t think any other small country with a language spoken by so few people could have a media market of such high quality and diversity,” she says.<p><p>Figures compiled by Media Audit Finland show that 93% of Finnish adults regularly read printed or digital newspapers. The printed media market is highly diverse for a country of just 5.5 million inhabitants, with more than 200 national or regional newspapers published at least weekly, and more than 4,000 magazines produced for different interest groups.<p><p>“Recent surveys show how Finns are starting to look to traditional newspapers again for quality analysis and balance, in a healthy reaction to the turbulence and unreliability of the social media,” Nousiainen points out.<p><p>Finland ranks third in the world for newspaper readers per capita. The printed media market is highly diverse for a country of just 5.5 million inhabitants, with more than 200 national or regional newspapers published at least weekly. Most households subscribe to a daily paper and several magazines, while also receiving many free magazines and newspapers. Photo: Mikko Stig/Lehtikuva<p><p>Like their counterparts in other countries, Finnish journalists have recently been increasingly targeted by online hate speech. Ilkka Nousiainen and Elina Grundström deplore this trend, and hope it won’t make Finnish journalists too cautious when writing on issues that provoke strong feelings, such as immigration, the refugee crisis, feminism, diets, hunting and gun laws. But they feel that self-censorship by the Finnish media on political issues has not been an issue since the days of the Cold War, when journalists used to be wary of criticising the Soviet Union.<p><p>According to Grundström, ongoing cuts by broadcasting and publishing companies represent a more serious threat to diversity and quality in Finnish media. “Finns tend to take the freedom of the press for granted, without realising it’s the product of journalists’ efforts over a long period. It’s worrying to see what’s happening to press freedom in parts of Eastern European and elsewhere,” she says.<p><p>The 2016 index shows an alarming rise in violations of media freedom worldwide due to religious intolerance, safety problems in conflict zones, and the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of many governments and media-owning oligarchs. The UNESCO event in Helsinki aims to promote freedom of information worldwide as a fundamental human right, to protect the press against censorship and excessive surveillance, and to ensure safety for journalists working both in the traditional media and online.<p><p>In Finland, a whole year of 2016 will be dedicated to the 250th Anniversary of the world”s first Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the theme of the year being “Right to Know, Right to Say”.<p><p>The Finn Anders Chydenius was one of the most notable politicians of eighteenth century Sweden-Finland. According to him, democracy, equality and a respect for human rights were the only way towards progress and happiness for the whole of society. His most important political accomplishment is the world´s first Freedom of the Press Act. Image: Siiri Viljakka, Script: Lauri Tuomi-Nikula/Last Words – the Return of Anders Chydenius. <p><p>To help budding investigative journalists and other media workers in countries where the freedom of the press cannot be taken for granted, the Finnish Foundation for Media and Development (Vikes) uses funding from the Finnish journalists’ union, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the EU to run projects where Finnish journalists’ expertise is used in training and networking.

Clocks. Fruit. Golf balls. A Finnish voice gives a laconic running commentary on the mayhem while another in the background laughs.<p><p>“The hockey puck exploded,” the voice announces. “Yeah. That’s all for today. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.”<p><p>This is Lauri Vuohensilta on his Hydraulic Press Channel, which has racked up tens of millions of views on YouTube. Part of the interest is in the crushing – it is pretty cool to watch a bowling ball pop under 100 tons of pressure – but much of the appeal is Vuohensilta and his wife Anni. They feed off each other and when one gets to laughing the other can’t stop.<p><p>“It would be stupid to laugh alone,” Vuohensilta explains. “It’s better to react to each other.”<p><p>One of the endearing features of the show is Vuohensilta’s voice. He is fluent in English but speaks with an accent peppered with Finnish pronunciations. For example, he pronounces “hydraulic” as “hoo-draulic.”<p><p>“There is an American YouTuber who speaks with a heavy Russian accent,” he says. “It’s very funny and entertaining. I think my voice is the same way.”<p><p>Vuohensilta shoots his videos in the shop of his company Konepaja Vuohensilta. The shop is filled with heavy tools: lathes, mills, welders and cranes. Some of them are old Russian machines which he has modernised. The balancing machine, which spins a part to make sure it was machined correctly, he built himself.<p><p>“I got my degree from the Tampere University of Technology,” Vuohensilta continues. “I only have a few more courses to go for my Master’s in engineering.”<p><p>The shop is also home to the hydraulic press, which is the star of the show. In it he puts Legos, coins, rubber ducks, little clay figures his wife makes… all sorts of things. He invites suggestions from his viewers and was surprised to get one from the White House in Washington, D.C.<p><p>“I thought it was a hoax at first,” Vuohensilta says. “I thought someone was trying to make fun of me.”<p><p>It was no joke. The White House asked him to crush a cable box as President Barrack Obama encourages competition in the cable television industry. Millions of people were entertained when something unexpected happened, as often does in these videos: the remote control popped out of the press and landed in a bucket of liquid nitrogen.<p><p><p><p>Vuohensilta has tested internet lore regarding one of Finland’s most famous products, the Nokia 3310 mobile phone. According to legend the phone is indestructible, and it was even the subject of the Unbreakable emoji from the Finnish Foreign Ministry. Vuohensilta put the 3310 into his press and discovered that it would, in fact, break.<p><p>“Those phones were so tough,” he says. “But I have to say that the Nokia still looked like a phone when it came out of the press.”<p><p><p><p>Vuohensilta’s plans for the future include a new press, which he will partially build himself. He wants one which is ten times as powerful and also portable, so he can crush things outside which he doesn’t want to do in his shop.<p><p>“I’m looking for partners and sponsors to help with the new press,” he explains. “One with 1,000 tons of force is normally very large, but this one will be compact, about the size of a small car.”<p><p>He has become a global ambassador of sorts, with millions of people enjoying his engineering mentality and Finnish humour. He is pleased to represent his country.<p><p>“I am the stereotypical Finnish man,” he laughs. “I listen to heavy metal, am a power lifter, and I crush things. I’m like a Viking. It is a good stereotype, both for me and for Finland.”<p><p>By David J.

Many of Helsinki Zoo’s residents are creatures that typically thrive in cold or mountainous regions, but even those originating from warmer climes don’t seem too bothered by the icy breeze blowing in from the Baltic.<p><p>European bison born in Helsinki are today roaming the forests of Russia. But there are no plans to introduce the zoo’s abominable snowmen into the wild. Photo: Korkeasaari Archives / Mari Lehmonen<p><p>“The welfare of our animals is our top priority, and to enable them to behave more naturally it’s important that they can spend as much time in their outdoor enclosures as they choose to,” explains Nina Trontti, the head of Korkeasaari’s animal care unit. “For this reason it makes little sense to keep large African animals like elephants or giraffes here. But our Bactrian camels from Central Asia and our Barbary macaques from the mountains of northernmost Africa are naturally adapted to cold conditions. Our lions seem to cope well too, and it’s funny to see how their cubs love to play in the snow – like all children!”<p><p>The conservation of biodiversity is another top priority for all responsible zoos today. Helsinki Zoo has built up a proud reputation as a trusted partner in international zoo-breeding programmes that aim to save endangered animals from mountainous and northerly regions.<p><p>Nina Trontti herself serves on an international committee working to preserve the world’s rarest leopard: the Amur leopard from the upland forests of Siberia and NE China. “There are only 60-80 Amur leopards left in the wild, but we’ve managed to breed more than 20 here in Helsinki,” she says. “The cubs born here have been sent to other zoos in the programme, but some zoo-bred cubs should soon be rehoused in large enclosures in a reintroduction site in the Amur region, and we hope that their cubs will then be released to boost the wild population.”<p><p>Only 60-80 Amur leopards are left in the wild, but more than 20 cubs have been bred in Helsinki as part of an international conservation programme. Photo: Korkeasaari Archives / Suvi Tihinen<p><p>“We’ve also bred more than 100 rare Himalayan snow leopards here at Korkeasaari since the 1960s through a similar long-term captive breeding programme – and we hope that our pair of splendid Amur tigers will soon raise cubs too,” she adds.<p><p>Nina Trontti’s own personal favourite zoo residents are markhors. These mountain goats with their strikingly spiralled corkscrew-like horns can be seen skipping blithely up the steep rocky slopes overlooking the pier where most of the zoo’s summer visitors arrive by boat. “We’re pleased that our markhors manage to produce kids here each summer, since markhors are endangered in their wild range in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trontti says.<p><p>Helsinki Zoo is a great place for kids – including those raised each summer by the island’s resident herd of endangered markhor goats. Photo: Korkeasaari Archives / Henrik Sundén<p><p>“In future we aim to increasingly offer the knowhow we’ve built up here to help with reintroductions back into the wild,” she adds. The zoo staff are proud that European bison and lynx born and bred in Helsinki are today roaming wild in the forests of Russia and Poland.<p><p>Helsinki Zoo also houses many Finnish wild animals, including bears, wolverines, lynx, otters, owls, elk and wild forest reindeer. These Nordic beasts particularly interest visitors from outside Finland, who make up about 10% of Helsinki Zoo’s 500,000 annual visitors. But they also appeal to many Finnish city kids who are unlikely to encounter these beautiful and impressive creatures anywhere else.<p><p>About 1,500 brown bears roam wild in Finland’s vast forests, but Korkeasaari is the easiest – and safest – place to encounter a frisky Finnish bear. Photo: Korkeasaari Archives / Mari Lehmonen<p><p>Education is also very much part of the zoo’s work. Korkeasaari’s new nature school facilities opened in January 2016, and crowds of eager schoolchildren will soon be busily exploring the island and enjoying specially designed creative tasks and animal-themed projects.<p><p>“We believe there’s very much a justifiable place for zoos today – not only for conservation, but also to give people more direct emotional contact with animals,” says Trontti. “We can all see amazing images of wildlife on the internet and TV nature documentaries, but it’s quite different to encounter a huge elk or a powerful tiger eye-to-eye!”<p><p>Helsinki Zoo stays open through the winter for animal-lovers and anyone keen to enjoy a bracing walk round the pleasant island of Korkeasaari.

In winter the peaceful island can be reached by footbridge from the terminus of bus 16, which visitors can catch in Railway Square or by Kulosaari metro station.

Communal saunas provide an informal setting for neighbours to get to know each other.<p><p>Special participatory days, like Restaurant Day for pop-up eateries and Cleaning Day for flea markets, are a uniquely Finnish innovation. Activists in Helsinki felt it was high time to add a new Sauna Day to the calendar, and encourage everyone in the Finnish capital to get heated up.<p><p>“Lots of public events are held around Helsinki each summer, but the summer’s so short that it would be nice for people to also get together at other times of year – and of course you can enjoy a sauna in any weather,” says Jaakko Blomberg of Yhteismaa, the organisation behind the new Sauna Day event, which was first held in March 2016.<p><p>Finns are famously fond of soaking in saunas, most commonly at home with the family, while holidaying in their country homes, or after exercising at a public swimming pool or gym . Photo: Kari Ylitalo / Visit Finland<p><p>Helsinki has a number of public saunas, but on Sauna Day many private saunas, including exclusive luxury facilities, are open to visitors. In addition to ordinary saunas in homes, apartment blocks and hotels, bathers on the first Sauna Day could also check out a backstage sauna normally frequented by rock stars, a sauna in a Mongolian yurt tent and a sauna in a giant barrel. Several rooftop saunas will test the theory that heat rises. Venues include saunas seating just two or three people, as well as rooms big enough for a couple of sports teams. Many of the saunas are heated by traditional wood-fired stoves.<p><p>In principle the Sauna Day saunas will be open free of charge, but some of their owners may charge a small fee to cover fuel costs, or sell refreshments. One sauna is offering fish burgers made of vendace – a small but delicious lake fish. To avoid having to queue for a place, bathers are encouraged to book sessions in smaller saunas in advance through the Sauna Day website.<p><p> <p><p>Local public saunas with traditional wood-fired stoves, like the ever popular Kotiharjun Sauna in Helsinki’s Kallio district, will also be open on Sauna Day.

The package contains clothes and other accessories for the baby, packed inside a cardboard box that is designed to be the first bed for the little one. The package is a well-liked and valued component of the Finnish welfare state and at the same time something very familiar and cozy.<p><p>When the BBC did an article about the maternity package in June 2013 the Finns soon found out that for the rest of the world the whole idea of the maternity package was something quite exotic. The story spread on the web at an unforeseen pace and is now the most shared article by the BBC ever.<p><p>The Finnish baby box trio (from the left): Heikki Tiittanen, Anton Danielsen and Anssi Okkonen have altogether eight children. When they started their venture, Tiittanen managed the company’s affairs on paternity leave when his son was taking a nap. Photo: Finnish Baby Box / Anssi Okkonen<p><p>Three young dads, all Masters of Science (technology), from the Helsinki region had marveled at the package even before the BBC article.<p><p>“For all three of us the opening of the package had been an intensive moment. ‘Gosh, I’m really going to be a father!’,” Heikki Tiittanen reminisces.<p><p>The popularity of the BBC article made the trio rush to action: the maternity package had to be made available for all. Kela, the social security institution responsible for the package, had at first been intrigued by the notion of selling the packages abroad. Unfortunately the idea is stymied by bureaucracy, at least for the time being.<p><p>In December 2014 the Finnish Baby Box company founded by Heikki Tiittanen, Anton Danielsen and Anssi Okkonen sent its first boxes to the wide world.<p><p>“The room of my soon-to-be-born third child acted as a warehouse and our living room served as both packing and dispatch department,” says CEO Tiittanen.<p><p>The baby box includes among other things clothes, sleeping bag, bedsheets, nail clippers, thermometer, reusable nappies and a teething ring. Both the baby box and the original maternity package also include condoms. Photo: Finnish Baby Box / Anssi Okkonen<p><p>The first boxes were almost identical with the official maternity packages. That attracted some feedback straight away. For example, in Australia the customers didn’t see the need for thick snowsuit which is one of the most popular items in Finland. Nowadays the products are chosen by the customer’s country of origin: the Aussies get coveralls better suiting their climate.<p><p>According to Heikki Tiittanen their customers have been satisfied with both the design and durability of the clothes. In many countries the colors of baby clothes are strictly for either boys or girls, for example, blue and pink. The clothes in the maternity box, on the other hand, are neutral, meant for both boys and girls.<p><p>Nevertheless, Tiittanen and his colleagues have had to do some educating as well. The Japanese, for instance, have wondered about the pants with socks attached. They are called ‘potkuhousut’, kicking pants in Finnish, and they are very popular in the home country of the maternity box. When wearing ‘potkuhousut’, the baby can’t kick his/hers socks off because they are part of the suit.<p><p>And the bed box itself has also caused some confusion. “At first people laugh at it, but we encourage everybody to give it a try. In my own experience it’s a remarkably convenient bed for the first few months of the baby. And when it is no longer needed you can fold it away for recycling – or turn into a car, as I did with my middle born son,” laughs Tiittanen.<p><p>From the start there has been a mattress inside the box, meant to act as a bed for the baby. The box is still a very popular first bed in Finnish families, regardless of the family’s income.Finnish Baby Box / Anssi Okkonen<p><p>The first year has been challenging but now the toil is starting to pay off. Finnish Baby Box has hired its first employees and moved out from Tiittanen’s living room. Boxes have been sent to over 50 different countries and customers are served online in English, Japan and soon in Chinese.<p><p>When Tiittanen, Danielsen and Okkonen launched their venture, they had altogether five children. At the time Tiittanen was on paternity leave from work for six months and managed the company’s affairs when his son was taking a nap. Now the trio has a total of eight children. All the products in the box have been tested and found commendable with their own children.<p><p>“If there’s one thing I hope it’s that fathers around the globe could be more involved in their children’s first year. I have experienced myself that the bond it creates is a strong one.”<p><p> <p><p>By Tuomo Tamminen, February 2016<p><p> <p><p>In Finland and other Nordic countries it is completely normal to let babies have their afternoon naps outdoors, even in sub-zero temperatures, that’s why the baby box includes padded suit and a sleeping bag. “All Finnish parents know that babies sleep better outdoors. This is a very long tradition. It’s all about the right clothing: the colder it is, the more layers you need”, says Specialist in Paediatrics Erik Qvist of Pikkujätti Medical Centre for Children and Youth. Photo: Pekka Nieminen <p><p>A warm sleeping bag, a hat with tiny pompoms and animal-themed baby clothes, all spread out on a living room that will welcome a small baby bringing great change. These are familiar images in Finnish homes, where a mother is preparing for the birth of her child. In Finland the social security system provides a maternity package to every expectant mother as a starter kit for the family.<p><p>The emphasis is on promoting the health and well-being of the mother and the child. The first maternity packages were given to low income mothers in 1937, and the public authorities decided who got the kit. The infant mortality rate at the time was high and the government wanted to ease the first months of the babies in the most deprived families with clothes, washing equipment and other accessories. Since 1949 the package has been available to every expecting mum, except those who lived in institutions or prisons. Those women were included in 1977.<p><p>From the start there has been a mattress inside the box, meant to act as a bed for the baby. The original idea of the box was to protect the infant from infections in cramped and meager war time conditions. The box is still a very popular first bed in Finnish families, regardless of the family’s income.

Launched in Finland in 2011, Restaurant Day is now one of the world’s biggest food carnivals. One-day restaurants have so far popped up in 72 different countries.

On Valentine’s Day, Finland is the place to be for those who appreciate their relationships with friends.<p><p>Do you remember that scene from the series Sex and the City, where Carrie and Miranda go for a Valentine’s Day dinner together since they didn’t have dates to go with? The pair is seated among the happy couples in a restaurant filled with red and pink balloons. They are the only friends who are just friends who have gone out on this special romantic day. If Carrie and Miranda lived in Finland, no one would think it unusual to see a pair of just-friends dining together on Valentine’s Day. In Finnish, Valentine’s Day is called ystävänpäivä (literally “Friend’s Day”) and, like the name says, the idea is to celebrate friendship. Ystävänpäivä in Finland is a public declaration of friendship.<p><p>It was only as late as the 1980s that Finland started celebrating “ystävänpäivä,” and the day has been officially included in Finnish calendars since 1996.

In the Catholic and Orthodox Christian tradition, it is celebrated during the three days before Ash Wednesday – which marks the start of Lent, a 40-day fast (eating very light food) before Easter. However, in Finland after the Reformation, fasting was no longer done, but many Shrovetide traditions continued, because people thought that following these customs would have a positive influence on their income.<p><p>During Shrovetide, work with sharp instruments was discontinued. Household chores were stopped in the afternoon or not done at all. Women would cease spinning linen. People would concentrate on eating fatty, heavy food. In fact, it was considered a good thing to show off the grease on your hands and on the corners of your mouth. It was believed that the more fatty foods you ate, the fatter the pigs would become, and the more milk the cows would produce.<p><p>Laskiaispulla, a Shrovetide bun, is the king of the season’s feast. There are two camps passionate about the filling of the pulla. One thinks marzipan (almond paste) is the one and only proper filling for the bun, whereas the other camp believes in strawberry jam. You have to choose your side, otherwise you can’t have a proper ‘laskiaispulla’ conversation.Photo: Tiina Krook<p><p>Other Shrovetide traditions included a tobogganing event. The farther you could sled, the taller your flax would grow, and the bigger your rutabagas and turnips would become. As always, a sauna was prepared to enjoy during this time. Nonetheless, it was important to be silent in the sauna, otherwise you could be plagued by lots of flies and mosquitoes during the next summer. Moreover, there was an old proverb about the weather. “If the sun is shining on Shrovetide, it will be a good year. If it snows on Shrovetide, it will snow every day until Easter.”<p><p>The traditional Shrovetide fare included substantial dishes such as fatty unleavened bread with pork, Russian blinis (small crepes) with meat or fish fillings, blood sausages, pea soup with ham, Finnish pancakes with jam, and rich pastries.<p><p>Most of these foods are still popular today. Although the star of the day is the beloved Shrovetide bun, ‘laskiaispulla’, a sweet pastry filled with almond paste or strawberry jam and lashings of whipped cream. Something most Finns cannot resist, and taking seconds or thirds is certainly not uncommon. To wash all these heavy morsels down, Finns drink coffee or hot cocoa.<p><p>Students make the most out of the Shrovetide festivals: they put together a boisterous programme of sledging competitions, music, barbequing, drinks and wild partying in the snow. ‘Laskiaisrieha’ in Tähtitorninmäki in Helsinki is one of the biggest student events of the year in Finland.Photo: Ylioppilaslehti<p><p>These days, Finns generally observe two days of this festival: Shrove Sunday and Shrove Tuesday. Shrove Sunday is often a family day full of sledging, ice-skating, cross-country and downhill skiing. On Shrove Tuesday, people flock to the nearest hill after work or school. Sometimes, schools organise a special fun day for pupils in the lower grades.<p><p>Student organisations often put together a boisterous programme of sledging competitions, music, barbequing, drinks, and wild partying in the snow. Even cities get into the act by putting together winter carnivals with snow play, parades, kids’ activities, snacks and concerts.<p><p>Shrovetide is meant for people of all ages and all walks of life. So, should you happen to be in Finland during Shrovetide, I will wish you a Slippery Shrovetide with perfect snow and sunny skies! And don’t forget to have pea soup and a Shrovetide bun!<p><p>By Russell Snyder<p><p>The good old days<p><p>Fests for families and friends<p>", "time": "2016-02-08T09:46:12+00:00", "type": "life"}

When she was returning to Finland, the couple had to decide where and whether they wanted to build a life together.<p><p>“Moving to Finland was a good choice, career-wise and family-wise. I like the work mentality here and the affordable day care for our daughter is a good benefit. In Italy the day care would cost us much more.”<p><p>Still, finding a job in his new home country was no picnic; a Masters of Science degree in technology did not immediately guarantee a career. Ruggero worked for the grocery store Lidl for a while, and did some temporary work. In 2007 he started work as a sales engineer at a company called Progman.<p><p>After ten years in Finland, Ruggero Valsecchi speaks fluent Finnish. And still enjoys the peacefulness of the new home country.<p><p>“When I left Italy, I lived in Milan. At 4 a.m. there is as much traffic on the highways as there is here in the morning rush hour!”<p><p>Ten years has also given him an interesting perspective on the culture.<p><p>“This might sound strange but in Italy the national identity is not as strong as it is here. Here people have certain important traditions and a strong sense of what Finland is. It has been interesting to see that as a foreigner.”<p><p> <p><p>Shuo Yang Originally from China Software engineer<p><p>This was Shuo Yang’s comment when she was asked to change her work environment from hectic Beijing to Salo in Southern Finland, which was… Hmmm! Let’s say, it was a little less hectic. <p><p>After working for Nokia in Beijing, Shuo Yang arrived in Salo at the end of June in 2005.<p><p>“The town was empty. The office was empty. There were exactly two people in the office and they had no idea what I was supposed to do. And they told me that this was the beginning of the holiday season, so nothing would be happening during the next month!”<p><p>So, this was the perfect time to adapt. Shuo Yang used the unexpected vacation to walk around the Salo area. When her work started properly in August, the Finnish work culture became familiar. “I feel that employers are respected a lot more in Finland than in China. Nokia, now Microsoft, has been a great company and colleagues are like my family.”<p><p>Shuo Yang has a 6-year old son from her previous marriage. This young man now goes to Finnish preschool. “He is a Finnish boy who likes sausages and meat balls. We talk in Chinese, but he has an accent.”<p><p>At the end of 2015, Microsoft closed many of its functions in Salo, leaving many people unemployed. Shuo Yang is one of them. “It will be a new experience to be unemployed in Finland. At least this will give me a chance to improve my Finnish. The unemployment office informed me that there should be Finnish courses available. Our life is now here, so I hope I will be able to find another job.”<p><p> <p><p>Joseph Knowles Originally from the USA PR manager and senior writer<p><p>Aki Kaurismäki. That was how it all started for American Joseph Knowles. Love for Finnish film gradually led to moving from sunny L.A. to Helsinki, which he considers the more cosmopolitan of the two.<p><p>“Kaurismäki films were my first introduction to Finland. I liked the fact that the characters didn’t have to say very much. They were all action and no words. It appealed to me.”<p><p>When studying at the London Film School, Joe mingled with a few Finns and met a lovely Finnish woman who spoke a little more than the characters in Kaurismäki films. After living in London and then back in California for three years, the couple moved to Finland.<p><p>Eventually, Joe landed a job in communications for Finnair. After a few years and countless air miles, he changed employers and went to work with other flying objects: birds and pigs.<p><p>“I work for Rovio now. This is truly an international company, with more than 40 different nationalities represented on the staff. And the games are played everywhere; we have customers all over the world.”<p><p>Interestingly enough, now he works in the film industry again, since The Angry Birds Movie is on its way. “There aren’t that many environments where a company like Rovio could have blossomed. It takes lot of unlikely people to come together. Finland is unique in this sense: I think this kind of climate combined with a highly educated workforce leads to a really interesting business environment – where your career can take surprising turns.”<p><p>But how about the weather? That is pretty bad though? “Well, if Finland would be sunny all the time, it wouldn’t be Finland. I have lived in eternal sunshine in L.A. and it is not what it is cut out to be. You need some darkness to appreciate the sunshine!”<p><p> <p><p>Allen Brown Originally from the UK On disability pension<p><p>Sometimes emigrating to Finland can happen on impulse, with no great passion one way or another. Allen Brown wanted a change, so he thought Finland was a good choice. And it was. And still is.<p><p>Allen Brown moved to Finland in 1998.<p><p>“I was sick and tired of England. There are just too many people there. Finland seemed like a nice place to move to. And it’s not always been easy, but it isn’t supposed to be easy!”<p><p>During the years, Allen Brown has had a variety of jobs, including work as silver service flambé chef and stone mason. He also saw another side of Finland when doctors discovered a tumor in his lungs.<p><p>“I went through chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Doctors gave me three months but that was a while ago, they are happily surprised that I am still here. I was treated very well in the public health care system. I’d say that if you are going to get cancer, get it in Finland! ”<p><p>After living in several places in and around the capital area, Allen Brown now lives in the Vallila area of Helsinki. He enjoys the neighborhood – which is the reason why he wishes others could enjoy it as well.<p><p>“This is where I should have been all the time. And this is my one criticism: I think life would be a lot better for everybody, if they could halve the price of accommodation in Helsinki.”<p><p> <p><p>Evon Söderlund Originally from Malaysia Entrepreneur and CEO<p><p>Malaysian cuisine, Asian hospitality and Finnish society – combining them has created a winning formula. Thus, Malaysian Evon Söderlund became a Finnish entrepreneur. Along the way she had to learn not to call her teacher “Teacher”.<p><p>Growing up in a little rural village in Malaysia, Evon first came to Europe to pursue her career as a dancer. She was living in London when she got an email reply from Jussi, a young Finn who she had met in Kuala Lumpur while Jussi was there as an exchange student.<p><p>“Jussi said that I should come and visit Finland. Then he casually mentioned that you know, studying in Finland is free, there are no tuition fees. I said, What!? He added that they actually get a student allowance every month from the government to be able to study. I said WHAT!?”<p><p>So, Evon arrived in Finland and life took some quick turns. She and Jussi fell in love, got married and settled in Helsinki. Evon found a job working in the Malaysian embassy and later on started her studies in the UAS degree programme in Hospitality, Tourism and Experience Management at Haaga-Helia.<p><p>She was one of the hardest working students. And would also stand up every day at the beginning of a lecture to greet the teacher, stubbornly calling every teacher “Teacher” to show her respect.<p><p>“Finally I gave up: if I was trying to get the teacher’s attention, they just would not respond if I called them “Teacher”. Then I said “Pekka”, and Pekka’s head turned around immediately! But being an Asian, it was hard to learn that you could be so casual with your teachers.”<p><p>Nowadays Evon runs a successful business with her husband Jussi. Huone Events hotel is the first of its kind, not only in Finland but in the world. It offers 12 different kinds of event rooms for meetings and gatherings. Malaysian culture and Finnish culture live side by side here: on the premises there are three saunas and guests are served delicious Malaysian food.<p><p>Evon and Jussi have taken major risks to make this happen but their hard work is paying off. In 2014, Evon was awarded the PwC’s Most Valuable Entrepreneur in Finland. Now she is giving back to society: not only does part of the business’s profit go to charity, but Evon and Jussi have created jobs for 12 people.<p><p>“The one thing I would say to every foreigner: Learn Finnish! It is not only about getting by with the language, but also to show respect to the people here. Even if you are not fluent, when people can see that you are making an effort, they will treat you a lot nicer.”<p><p>By Maija Kajanto, January 2016<p><p>Photos: interviewees<p><p>“Finns get things finished”<p><p>“To Finland?

{"title": "Master of Scandinavian flavours - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/master-of-scandinavian-flavours/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Keep it simple. That is the recipe for any good dish, argues Pekka Terävä, a Michelin-star chef and restaurateur.<p><p>Simple is also his answer for describing his most memorable food experience of late: self-caught fish, freshly cooked over an open fire, with the silence of the Finnish wilderness as a side dish.<p><p>“The overall experience comes first. That is also what I wish to provide for the people I cook for. It’s quite okay to work around the clock, if you have a customer who is so happy with the food and the experience, he or she almost cries,” Terävä muses.<p><p>I interviewed Terävä at his restaurant Olo, right next to Helsinki Market Square and the Presidential Palace. The large windows are opened out to reveal a picturesque alley as the city awakes to a new morning. Every now and then he flashes a welcoming smile and waves to someone walking by, even inviting an old acquaintance in for a brief chit-chat. It seems he is well connected, well-travelled and a much liked person.<p><p>And Pekka Terävä is clearly a magician in the culinary arts, too. He and his team at Olo serve a menu encompassing 22 dishes, and he still claims that the guest will feel good after eating it all. Again, the key is simplicity.<p><p>“Let the ingredient talk. Everything superfluous has to be taken away,” says Michelin-star chef Pekka Terävä.Photo: Mirva Kakko/ Otavamedia<p><p>“Let the ingredient talk. Everything superfluous has to be taken away, so that, what we have left in every dish are the essential ingredients. There is variety in the consistency – something crispy and something soft. And it needs to taste good.”<p><p>Scandinavian flavours have brought the restaurant one Michelin star. The star is the well-earned result of years of work: Terävä’s experience has been gained by establishing numerous restaurants and participating in the advancement of Finnish food culture: a culture which has taken giant leaps towards becoming a culinary hot spot because it draws from Finland’s untainted nature and four seasons.<p><p>“Helsinki, for instance, is now a culinary city that is worth visiting just for its food.”<p><p>“If I was to peel asparagus every day, I would get bored very soon,” Pekka Terävä says and continues: “The strong seasonal changes inspire my work, I can always use what’s best at the moment.” Photo: Mirva Kakko/ Otavamedia<p><p>The four Nordic seasons; summer, autumn, winter and spring have always determined what the region eats. The long, cold winter is when a chef’s creativity is truly put to the test. Anything green and fresh is a distant memory, and ingredients produced in greenhouses just taste bland. But that is why Terävä finds this an utterly interesting season.<p><p>“There is no easy solution, and we really need to concentrate on the ingredients we use, be it, for example, root vegetables such as carrots or parsnips. Traditions are important, and we get to utilize the traditional fermentation methods of yesteryear,” he says.<p><p>But as the summer gets closer, Finns become spoiled. One of the first indicators of summer is the arrival of new potatoes. They are found on every plate from homes to restaurants. Rather boring at a first glance, but an ingredient that is constantly mentioned in Terävä’s conversation.<p><p>“Finnish potatoes are the best in the world. The short season keeps the land rich in nutrients and makes the potato fight for its existence, which generates the superior taste. The same is true of everything that grows here, up north, like delicious summer vegetables.”<p><p>Finnish nature comes with an overwhelming array of excellent ingredients. Thousands of lakes provide first class fish such as lake perch, pikeperch and northern pike. The cold waters give the fish a unique consistency and a positively neutral taste, Terävä explains.<p><p>In the forests, there are elk, chanterelles, berries and wild herbs, just to name a few. Many of them are only freshly available for a short period.<p><p>“If I was to peel asparagus every day, I would get bored very soon”, Terävä says and continues: “The strong seasonal changes inspire my work, I can always use what’s best at the moment.” When the first layer of ice appears on Lake Inari in Lapland, we see reindeer on Olo’s menu. When the first snow blankets the Kustavi archipelago in Souhtwest Finland, we get venison.<p><p>Michelin stars don’t come easy, admits Terävä, who works long days. This father of two sons has his priorities and scarce spare time is spent with the family and coaching football teams – as one could expect from an avid football enthusiast and a formerly active player.<p><p>Whenever Terävä is given the chance, he acts like every other Finn and escapes to the summer cottage. The quietness of the natural world provides a balance to life in the fast lane.<p><p>However, Terävä sees airports more than his summer cottage. Travelling comes with the job, though Terävä often takes his family along.<p><p>“When abroad, me and my wife get to choose the restaurant one day and the kids the next”, he laughs. “But it is not just about the food, it is about gathering people together to enjoy the food and the company.”<p><p>One of Pekka Terävä’s passions is the Bocuse d’Or, a biennial world chef championship that is considered one of the world’s most prestigious cooking competitions. Terävä is the President of the Finnish Bocuse d’Or team and has previously competed himself.<p><p>Now Terävä is coaching an ambitious young chef Eero Vottonen, who will represent Finland in the 2016 European semi-finals in Budapest, Hungary. From there, the best twelve countries continue to the final, held in 2017 in Lyon, France.<p><p>“It is a huge effort. The whole team spends thousands of hours practicing the winning dishes.”<p><p>But a top chef would not be a top chef without a competitive spirit and a passion for food.

After all, football is a universal language,” says Nohynek.<p><p>Mustafa Abdelwahab is glad for the opportunity to play football, since it helps him put his life as an asylum seeker out of his mind for a moment. Photo: Antti Kivimäki<p><p>Although Tiia Nohynek is the daughter of a football player, she does not play at the Club. Instead, she is in charge of the operations: getting asylum seekers from the centre to the field. She also washes and dries the players’ shirts so eagerly that sometimes her own laundry is neglected.<p><p>And her will to help doesn’t end at football. A few weeks ago, Nohynek promised to take a couple of asylum seekers to a free reggae party at The International Culture Centre Caisa.<p><p>“When I went to pick them up from the reception centre, there were 40 guys waiting, saying ’Let’s go to the disco!’ After that, they have started to call out ‘disco disco’ or ‘football’ every time they see me”, Nohynek laughs. This becomes abundantly clear, as Nohynek and another active member of Meet the Neighbours, Mohamed Abdelgayed , are picking up a couple of Iraqi asylum seekers to play football.<p><p>“Disco, disco”, repeats Mustafa Abdelwahab, a lively chauffeur from Baghdad, while smiling widely at Nohynek. “It has been very important to get to play football in Helsinki. Everyone can forget their situation as asylum seekers and feel like they are starting something new,” says Abdelwahab gratefully.<p><p>“In Iraq, people didn’t play much football due to violence, but here I have already played three times.”<p><p>Abdelwahab worked for a long time as a chauffeur in Baghdad for the Ministry of Agriculture. Difficulties started for him when the ministry transferred from being under the Sunni authority to the Shia, since Abdelwahab himself is a Sunni Muslim.<p><p>“I was no longer given assignments as a chauffeur; they told me to clean the toilets.”<p><p>Soon, Abdelwahab started to receive intimidating telephone calls threatening that he would be kidnapped – meaning assassinated – if he would not give up his job. Pressure kept building, and Mustafa Abdelwahab decided to flee from Iraq.<p><p>The other man joining them to play football is Ali Gazi, a restauranteur from Mosul. He is quieter than Abdelwahab, and clearly nervous. He is concerned for the health of his three-month-pregnant wife and their eight-month-old child, and whether they will receive the treatment they might need in Finland.<p><p>Mohamed Abdelgayed, who is originally from Egypt, reassures Gazi in Arabic that the Finnish health care system takes good care of both children and mothers.<p><p>Mohamed Abdelgayed (left) and Tiia Nohynek arrange free football games for asylum seekers and Finns. At the goal is Iraqi asylum seeker Mustafa Abdelwahab.Photo: Antti Kivimäki<p><p>Both Iraqi men would like to get work soon in their own fields: Ali Gazi in the kitchen and Mustafa Abdelwahab at the wheel.<p><p>Firstly, they need a permit to work in Finland, and this will take months. An asylum seeker may work in Finland even before receiving a residence permit, but only after residing in Finland for at least three months.<p><p>Mohamed Abdelgayed tries to calm the men’s eagerness to work and reminds them that it might be useful to learn the Finnish language and culture before starting work.<p><p>Ali Gazi ran a restaurant in Mosul in northern Iraq, but after the area was taken over by Isis life there became unbearable. Gazi is a Sunni Muslim, but his wife is Shia, and this did not sit well with Isis. Isis activists attacked Gazi’s restaurant, breaking and stealing everything, so Gazi thought it would be wisest to flee the country with his family.<p><p>Gazi himself does not play football, but he likes to sit by the field to rest his nerves. “As a child, there was no time for recreation; we needed to work. I like to watch people playing football,” he says.<p><p>Last year, the referee club Helsingin Erotuomarikerho titled Egyptian Mohamed Abdelgayed the “King of Gravel Pitches”.Photo: Antti Kivimäki<p><p>Mohamed Abdelgayed, active member of Meet the Neighbours, moved to Finland with his wife in search of work six years ago – before the Arab Spring and Egypt sliding into a cycle of violence – and he is now working as a sous chef at one of the top restaurants in Helsinki.<p><p>In Egypt, he used to play football in junior division One, and after arriving in Helsinki, he eagerly joined the adults’ divisions Three and Four.<p><p>“It helped me to integrate into the society. I met Finnish people and got to talk to them.”<p><p>A muscle injury ended Abdelgayed’s serious football playing a few years ago. To stay connected to the sport, he took a course in football refereeing, and now he referees local games of lower leagues in Helsinki. Last year, the referee club Helsingin Erotuomarikerho titled him the “King of Gravel Pitches”.<p><p>Abdelgayed appreciates the fact that Finland’s football culture is very organised. Games and practices are held on time, and the field is punctually cleared for the next team. Finns also respect referees, so Abdelgayed has been able to referee in peace here.<p><p>“In some countries, referees get threatened.”<p><p>Mustafa Abdelwahab (left), Tiia Nohynek, Mohamed Abdelgayed and Ali Gazi gather regularly to the football field. Mustafa and Mohamed are usually playing, Tiia is organising and Ali is watching others play. Photo: Antti Kivimäki<p><p>The significance of football in creating solidarity between asylum seekers and Finns has been noticed in other places as well. In the Ruukki reception centre in Northern Ostrobothnia football is very popular, and asylum seekers play among themselves and with local residents.<p><p>“Right now, there are so many people coming in that our efforts are focused on basic things such as arranging accommodation. But as things calm down, we’ll have more time to spare for leisure time activities,” tells Director of the Centre Sirpa Kallio.<p><p>Kallio, who has also worked as a psychotherapist, emphasises that activities are important in reception centres. Most asylum seekers are willing to work, but the remote Ruukki does not offer many opportunities. “Most of the people arriving have worked or studied in their homeland – and suddenly everything stops. If a person is without work or something else to do, it leaves an impact.”<p><p>“For sporty people, sports is a good way to help symptoms of trauma. Even if people are depressed and anxious, they should not exclude the thing that brings them joy.”<p><p>By: Antti Kivimäki, September 2015<p><p>The flow of asylum seekers from the Mediterranean all the way to Finland has surprised everyone. Since it started, demonstrations have been organised both for and against, and the Finnish Prime Minister has promised to put up asylum seekers in his home.<p><p>During the last ten years Finland has received approximately 3,500 asylum seekers per year. The annual amount of those seeking asylum has varied between 1,505–5,988.<p><p>This year, and specifically this autumn, the amount of people seeking asylum has increased enormously. Between January and August 2015 there were 7,015 asylum seekers, and in September alone there were 10,000 more.<p><p>According to the Ministry of the Interior’s Forecast (14.10.2015) Finland will have a total of 35,000 asylum seekers this year.<p><p>There have been demonstrations around Finland both for and against taking asylum seekers.<p><p>Demonstrations against taking asylum seekers have, on average, attracted a few dozen participants in each city where they have been held. Mainly they have been located where new reception centres have been founded or on the border between Finland and Sweden in Tornio.<p><p>As a counter reaction there have been several demonstrations in support of taking refugees. In the largest demonstration, in Helsinki at the end of July, more than 10,000 people demonstrated for a multicultural Finland. One group, Finland says Welcome, organised a welcome picnic where 1,500 people took part.<p><p>The biggest sensation was caused by a case in Lahti during September where a bus carrying asylum seekers was shot at with fireworks by around 30 demonstrators, one of whom was a 19-year-old man wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit.<p><p>After the attack the Finnish Government strongly condemned all racist protesting. Read the statement here.<p><p>The city of Lahti decided to strongly reject racism. Local businesses want to welcome the asylum seekers in Hennala to the sports city by organising a football event on 30 September 2015. The theme for the match, which will take place on the football ground close to the emergency shelter, is ‘Let’s play bAll together’.<p><p>Also, there will be a demonstration by local residents against racism and violence in Lahti Market Square next Saturday, entitled ‘Open Lahti’. A large number of active residents help at the emergency shelter as Red Cross volunteers. There are a total of 150 volunteers working at the Hennala unit, which houses some 500 refugees.<p><p>Applying for asylum in Finland is a long process. You may seek asylum if you have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in your home country. The Finnish asylum application procedure is explained here.<p><p>Normally the decision of the asylum application has been made in six months. Now there’s a fear that the process will take over a year due to the unexpected amount of asylum seekers arriving in Finland. The Ministry of the Interior is trying to solve the situation by giving more resources to the Police and The Finnish Immigration Service.<p><p>There is a huge need for housing for asylum seekers across Finland. The Finnish Red Cross has 48 reception centers around Finland and due to the current flow of asylum seekers the country needs more than 500 housing places per day.<p><p>The Finnish prime minister Juha Sipilä led by example for the Finnish people on accepting asylum seekers. Sipilä offered his second home for asylum seekers to use coming at the end of the year. The house is located in his home town of Kempele in Northern Finland.<p><p>Finns have been very active volunteers. The Finnish Red Cross alone has had over 4,500 sign-ups for volunteer work on their website. Many people have just walked into Red Cross premises and signed up for volunteer work.<p><p>Tens of thousands of people have donated winter clothes, sports gear and household items for asylum seekers. The amounts given have been so enormous that the Finnish Red Cross has had to pause collections to allow donations to be sorted.<p><p>The traditional Hunger Day fund-raising event organised by the Finnish Red Cross will most likely reach three million euros this autumn – which would make the result the third best in the history of Hunger Day. (Donations can be sent until the end of October.)<p><p>Some of the volunteers are helping using their special skills.

Finland has taken an approach that Russia, Finland as well as the other neighbouring countries should be deeply interested in developments in the Baltic Sea region, not in building fences and barriers on the borders.”<p><p>Artem Filatov, Russian Federation<p><p> <p><p>“Finland is known worldwide for the freedom of its press, which is admirable.”<p><p>Özüm Örs, Turkey<p><p> <p><p>“Finland is a tranquil country. On Helsinki’s streets, rush hour is almost non-existent and on a relaxed Sunday afternoon it is so quiet that you could almost hear a pin drop at the other end of the city.”<p><p>Michael Ertl, United Kingdom<p><p> <p><p>“Finland, among the other Scandinavian countries, has successfully implemented the Nordic model; a combination of free market economy and welfare state and that has led to general prosperity, eradication of poverty and the superiority of people’s freedom and liberties in Northern Europe.”<p><p>Oleksandr Guzenko, Ukraine<p><p> <p><p>“Gender equality shows in Finland in different ways. Men take part in housework which is considered as a woman’s job in Kazakhstan. My own family would want to see me married as soon as possible whereas in Finland my host family’s dad told me I have a lot of time, because I’m still young. According to the standards of Kazakh society, I might have missed my chance of becoming a happy wife and mother already.”<p><p>Sabina Serikova, Kazakhstan<p><p>Fabienne, Mohammed, Yana, Yumi, Oleksandr, Rana and Richard all say they had the time of their lives in Finland. Many of them experienced not just Finland for the first time but also its food, the Finnish people and their manners – and of course sauna.<p><p> <p><p>“Finland has a very interesting culture. The first thing I can distinctly remember enjoying was Hel Looks – a wonderful street fashion blog that captures the most original dressers from Helsinki. Then came the Finnish music, the design and the architecture…”<p><p>Martyna Trykozko, Poland<p><p> <p><p>“Finns are really good at underrating themselves and focus on what has to be improved instead of being proud of their success. We heard that the Finns have been doubtful and cautious for a long time but that they are now more optimistic than they’ve ever been before, and they have a reason to be. The industry has never been easy and even when people look longingly back to the golden days: Economics are changing everywhere. And Finland isn’t afraid of facing that.”<p><p>Fabienne Kinzelmann, Germany<p><p> <p><p>“Finnish national design is known for its clear and pure shapes, honesty in the materials, functionality and widespread availability. Well-designed Finnish products can be found in regular supermarkets all across the country.

There’s no need for chit chatting.”<p><p>Petter Brønstad, Norway<p><p> <p><p>“I got my first answer even without asking. ‘We are very good at reading! People here learn to read even before they go to school,’ a young Finn told me. To me, it seems like a reasonable answer and also a very good explanation of what makes education in Finland as good as it is. Every time I really had the chance to talk to someone, I found myself around curious people who were genuinely interested in developing conversations on complex topics.”<p><p>Bruna Passos Amaral, Brazil<p><p> <p><p>“Finland is getting famous in Korea not only for Xylitol and the Moomins but also for education. Finland is known as a country that is able to educate its people as brilliantly as Korea but with far more gentle methods. One could say that Korean education can literally ‘make’ people smart, but it tends not to care how to keep students happy.”<p><p>Yumi Jeung, Republic of Korea<p><p>The world famous Finnish school system was experienced during the programme. The school year in Finland starts in the middle of August.<p><p> <p><p>“In my opinion the main difference between the Finns and Russians is in their punctuality and compliance with the laws. I’ve never met a Finn who is late, even if the meeting is informal.”<p><p>Yana Prussakova, Russian Federation<p><p> <p><p>“The Finns are firmly connected with the nature of their country and appreciate that the world is responsible for giving them the resources we all need to live our daily lives. Finnish forests are an intrinsic part of their folklore, the native people of Finland having a strong connection with the world around them. In ancient history, when the Finns had to look for safety they would escape to the forest, not run away from it as you might expect. Helsinki is the only capital city which is surrounded by three national parks, meaning the importance of them cannot be overstated for the residents.”<p><p>Richard Morris, United Kingdom<p><p>FCP participants found out that Finns are very attached to nature and love to exercise in the woods.<p><p> <p><p>“Finns drink a lot of coffee, so one of the things I was looking forward to, was sampling some good coffee.

In Ethiopia, coffee basically means a strong, very dark espresso-like drink.”<p><p>Eskedar Kifle, Ethiopia<p><p> <p><p>“Unlike in France, nothing in Finland stops as soon as five centimetres of snow fall on the ground.

{"title": "Experiencing the Finnish sauna - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/experiencing-the-finnish-sauna-2/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The old Finnish proverb “First build the sauna, then the house” shows how seriously Finns take this national institution. As our American reporter knows, it’s also a topic that they love to talk about.<p><p>Finland, a country whose sauna traditions go back a couple thousand years, boasts a range of studies, seminars, magazines and clubs devoted to the subject of saunas. In the old days, the sauna was a place to get clean, take care of personal hygiene, cook, store things, give birth and, most importantly, escape the cold of winter for a while.<p><p>Nowadays there are two million saunas, located in houses, apartment buildings, companies, government offices, swimming pools, summer cottages, yachts and bars. There is one in the Parliament building, one at the bottom of Pyhäsalmi Mine (the world’s deepest sauna) and one that holds the honour of being the world’s largest (Jätkänkämppä in Kuopio). Mobile saunas even exist – various versions have been built into buses, trailers, tents, telephone booths, farm machinery and even bicycles, and a Mobile Sauna Festival is held in the western Finnish town of Teuva.<p><p>When even a waterside location isn’t close enough, you need a floating sauna like this one on the Tornio River on the border between northern Finland and Sweden.Photo: TimoOK/flickr, cc by-nc-nd 2.0<p><p>Upon arrival in Finland, I immediately started hearing praise about the sauna. It’s the supreme health treatment, Finns told me. My first experience was in Tampere at a public swimming pool. As instructed, I alternated between sitting in the sauna and taking a refreshing swim in the pool, not to mention hitting myself lightly with a bouquet of birch branches in the sauna to improve circulation. Afterwards, I felt marvellous, refreshed and invigorated. The next morning I woke up with a terrible cold.<p><p>The cold soon went away, and my appreciation of the sauna grew. I was delighted to find that my apartment building had a sauna. A neighbour explained that it had a rare, natural-gas stove. First you heated the stones for two hours, then turned it off and let the heat spread for 30 minutes. The result: heavenly warmth. Technically, this was probably the best sauna I’ve ever had. Unfortunately, the stove made a mild explosive sound when you lit it, so they replaced it with an electric one. Goodbye, perfect sauna.<p><p>Once, while having a winter sauna in the countryside with friends, they suggested that I try snow rolling, which they described as stimulating and pleasant. Soft and powdery, the snow looked almost cosy. Nevertheless, when it came into contact with my body, I felt like I was rolling naked through a cactus garden.<p><p>“That was terrific,” I lied. “Good,” my friends said, “now you’re ready to try the avanto.” Finns wax poetic about the wonders of avanto-uinti, swimming in a hole in the ice of a frozen lake or ocean, often in combination with a visit to the sauna.<p><p>Ice swimming can be enjoyed in combination with a sauna. This bather is testing the waters of Kilpisjärvi, a lake at the far northwestern tip of Finland, where it touches Norway and Sweden.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>Then there was the time I was staying at a quaint old mansion hotel in eastern Finland in early autumn. In the daytime, I hiked around the captivating forests, and in the evening I feasted on a sumptuous dinner. I was the only guest at the hotel and decided to have a lakeside sauna at midnight. After getting good and sweaty, I dove into the lake.<p><p>The water temperature was surprisingly agreeable, and it was easy to leisurely float on the surface. But it was so dark that I could hardly see anything. My mind began to race. What if I hit my head on the pier? Or if my feet got stuck in the muddy bottom? And aren’t bears excellent swimmers?<p><p>“You’re back so soon?” the manager remarked. “Yes,” I said, “I thought I’d get some sleep. Big day tomorrow.”<p><p>Over the years, the Finns have given me the opportunity to try smoke saunas with heat soft as silk, a roof-top sauna with spectacular views and a sauna that was 110 degrees Celsius (230 Fahrenheit). I was surprised that I survived the latter – a more typical temperature would be closer to 80 degrees Celsius (176 Fahrenheit), which is still pretty hot.<p><p>I’ve been to gigantic saunas, one-person saunas and after-sports saunas. I’ve been to wild saunas with boisterous conversations and ones where I could relax in solitude. In gathering all these interesting experiences, I’ve acquired many great memories. Most importantly, I now have an excellent topic for eloquent conversations with the Finns.<p><p>By Russell Snyder, June 2013<p><p>Sauna reigns supreme<p><p>Saunas of all sorts<p>", "time": "2015-08-26T14:02:52+00:00", "type": "life"}

The new tripartite government finally named on May 29 has been formed by the three parties from the centre and right wing of the political spectrum who gained the most seats in the election: the conservative Centre Party, the populist “Finns” Party, and the moderate conservative National Coalition Party.<p><p>The Centre Party and the National Coalition Party are long established parties who have often been in government. The “Finns,” contrastingly, are entering a governing coalition for the first time. The government will enjoy a strong majority, with its parties holding 124 of the 200 seats in Finland’s parliament.<p><p>The new cabinet members pass a Helsinki sightseeing boat on their way to a press conference.Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>The new prime minister is the Centre Party’s chairman, Juha Sipilä, a first-timer in government. Sipilä, 54, first became a member of parliament in 2011, and was chosen to lead his party a year later. Before entering politics he set up a successful business and went on to serve as CEO at a major IT company.<p><p>The Centre Party were the big winners of the election, increasing their share of parliamentary seats from 35 to 49. The party had been in opposition since losing 16 seats in a dramatic election defeat in 2011.<p><p>The Centre Party’s main partners in opposition for the last four years were the “Finns,” who had increased their share of the vote more than any other party back in 2011, when they won 39 seats compared to just 5 in the previous parliament in an exceptional performance that rewrote Finnish electoral history. The “Finns” nevertheless chose to remain in opposition in 2011, after vehemently opposing the provision of support to Greece and Portugal by Finland and the other Eurogroup countries.<p><p>The “Finns” maintained their popularity in this spring’s election, winning 38 seats. Timo Soini, who has led the party for the last 18 years, is Finland’s new minister for foreign affairs.<p><p>The third party in the new government, the National Coalition Party, had been the largest party in the previous parliament and government. But this spring they suffered a bitter defeat, losing seven seats and ending up with 37. In spite of this setback, the party will remain in the new government, with party leader Alexander Stubb demoted from prime minister to minister of finance.<p><p>Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) announces the formation of his new cabinet, flanked by Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (right) and Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb.Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>Mr Sipilä’s government aims to emphasise continuity in its foreign and security policies. Finland will remain officially non-aligned, but wishes to hang on to the option to apply for NATO membership at a later date. Military cooperation with Sweden will be enhanced.<p><p>Finland still aims to maintain good relations with neighbouring Russia, in spite of continuing approval for EU economic sanctions against Russia. Experts reckon that the crisis in Ukraine has weakened security in the Baltic Sea region. It is expected that this situation will be evaluated in more depth during the new government’s time in office. Its programme stipulates that: “The Government will prepare a Report on Finnish Security and Defence Policy and, in connection with its preparation, assess the effects of Finland’s possible NATO membership. In addition, it will prepare a defence report defining defence policy guidelines for the maintenance, development and exercise of defence capability.”<p><p>The new government programme also includes three highly significant statements related to EU policy:<p><p>1) The European Union must focus on the most essential issues; it is not necessary to deepen integration in all policy areas.<p><p>2) The Government is opposed to increasing Finland’s liabilities in handling the euro crisis.<p><p>3) The EU is an important security community for Finland. Finland supports the strengthening of the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy and the reform of the Union’s Security Strategy.<p><p>A flock of 14 newly minted ministers arrange themselves to prepare for a smiling group photo.Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>In the middle of the negotiations to form the new government, Finland received bad news from the EU Commission, whose forecasts indicate that Finland’s economy is likely to grow next year by just one percent, while the growth rate in the Eurozone as a whole is expected to be 1.9%. Investments are meanwhile declining in Finland for the fourth year running.<p><p>The Commission believes that Finland will no longer be able to comply with the debt and the deficit criterion of the Stability and Growth Pact. The budget deficit is expected to exceed the 3% threshold, while national debt may soon exceed 60% of gross national product.<p><p>The new government aims to shake up public sector finances with a heavy hand. Savings amounting to four billion euros have already been lined up, with cuts coming in all parts of the public sector except defence. Significant savings are particularly envisaged in social and health services, education and business subsidies.<p><p>On top of these savings the government is threatening to make cuts of a further 1.5 billion euros if the trade unions do not agree to sign up to a new social contract this summer. The government hopes to persuade the unions to agree to longer working hours without pay rises, which in practice means reduced pay rates.<p><p>According to a government estimate, Finland’s competitiveness has weakened by 10–15% compared to major competing countries, making Finnish products less attractive in markets around the world.<p><p>The unions have accused the government of blackmail – and their views have been backed by the “red-green” opposition bloc in parliament, which includes the Social Democrats, the Left Alliance and the Greens.<p><p>Allowing himself a wry smile, fledgling Prime Minister Juha Sipilä sidesteps a few reporters.Photo: Martti Kainulainen/Lehtikuva<p><p>During the government-shaping negotiations the Social Democrats’ chairman Antti Rinne, who had been minister of finance in the previous government, accused Juha Sipilä’s government of endangering social stability by threatening to target families, students, pensioners and the unemployed with hefty cuts if the unions do not agree to lower pay or longer hours.<p><p>The Greens’ chairman Ville Niinistö, who served as minister of the environment in the last government, and Left Alliance chairman Paavo Arhinmäki, former minister of culture and sport, criticised the parties in the new government for failing to meet promises made during their election campaigns. Before the election all of the parties pledged they would not cut spending on education. But such cuts now lie ahead.<p><p>Finland’s economic woes have also attracted the attention of academics. The American Nobel-laureate economist Paul Krugman recently wrote two blog posts assessing the Finnish economy, published in the New York Times at the end of May and in early June.<p><p>Krugman puts the main blame for Finland’s poor economic performance on the euro’s position as a shared currency. The euro has become a straightjacket that stops Finland from restoring its competitiveness by devaluing its own currency. Krugman recalls how during the slump of the early 1990s Finland devalued the mark and managed to rapidly enhance competitiveness. But because Finland no longer has its own currency, the only way to restore competitiveness today is through internal devaluation achieved by reducing pay rates, he forecasts.<p><p>The new government will most likely endure a rough ride through its first summer in office. The goal is to have a new social contract signed by August 21. At the time of writing, in early June, it feels as if building such an agreement will be very difficult.<p><p> <p><p> <p><p>By Unto Hämäläinen, June 2015<p><p>Game of thrones<p><p>Treading a fine line<p><p>Significant savings scheduled<p><p>A long summer ahead<p>", "time": "2015-06-10T08:31:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "After Finnish election, anything can happen - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/after-finnish-election-anything-can-happen/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In the 2015 Finnish parliamentary election, the Centre Party and the Greens staged comebacks to increase their numbers of MPs, and were the only parties to do so. There’s still plenty of room for speculation about the composition of the upcoming government.<p><p>With all the votes counted, the main result is exactly as predicted: The conservative Centre Party, which in 2011 had suffered a huge loss and been relegated to the opposition, rose to the surface again, jumping from 35 seats in the 200-person Parliament back to 49, just two MPs shy of its pre-2011 total. Meanwhile the populist “Finns” Party treaded water, losing one seat and keeping 38 to claim second place just ahead of the moderate conservative National Coalition Party, which lost seven and was left with 37. The Social Democrats are still in the game with 34 MPs, but this represents a drop of eight seats and continues a downward trend for them. The Greens bounced back to reclaim the five seats they lost in 2011, for a total of 15, and became the only other party besides the Centre to increase their representation. The Left Alliance came up short with a loss of two seats but held on to 12, while the Christian Democrats were taken down a notch, dropping from seven to six. The Swedish People’s Party, which gains its support mainly from speakers of Finland’s other official language, holds steady at nine MPs, as it has for the past several terms.<p><p>Nasima Razmyar celebrates with Social Democratic Party colleagues upon learning that she has been voted into Parliament.Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>Four years ago, the “Finns” Party refused to consider joining the government because of a campaign promise not to support a bailout package for Greece. In the run-up to this year’s election, they were careful to suggest no such conditions. In fact, they openly dropped hints that they were ready for possible participation in the next government. Anything can still happen, and the pundits can have fun speculating until at least early May, but the Centre’s Juha Sipilä will surely become Prime Minister. It’s quite likely that he will form a government coalition consisting of the “Finns” Party and either the Social Democrats or the National Coalition. Either combination puts the total over 120, the amount considered necessary for an effective coalition. All this makes it unlikely that we will see a repeat of 2011, when it took a couple months – unheard of in Finland – to put together a patchwork government composed of six different parties, including the Social Democrats and led by the National Coalition. In a subplot of the election story, it remains to be seen whether the Swedish People’s Party will continue to form part of the government – it has been a member of the ruling coalition for the past 36 years. None of the other parties may be written off, either.<p><p>Emma Kari hugs Ozan Yanar (both Greens) as results come in showing that they have both won seats in Parliament. The Greens and the Centre were the only parties to increase their numbers of MPs this time.Photo: Roni Rekomaa/Lehtikuva/STR<p><p>There may be a more telling trend here for those who look – one that is perhaps more meaningful to young voters than the posturing of various party heavyweights while a government coalition attempts to coalesce. Slowly the face of Finnish politics is changing, as is the face of Finland, although to find this change you need to look beyond the Centre and the “Finns” Party. After gaining its first black member of parliament in 2011 (actor Jani Toivola, who has been re-elected for the Greens), Finland now has its first two modern-day immigrant MPs: Nasima Razmyar (Social Democrats), who was born in Afghanistan and moved to Finland at the age of eight, and Ozan Yanar (Greens), who was born in Turkey and moved to Finland at the age of 14. (Their precursors were an Estonian-born Finn in the mid-1940s and a Swedish-born MP who just finished a term representing the semi-autonomous Åland Islands.) It’s also worth noting that in the Helsinki election district the National Coalition took first place and the Greens added voters to achieve a strong second, trailed by the Social Democrats, the “Finns” Party and the rest. The Finnish capital also garnered the highest voter turnout out of all 13 districts, with 74.9 percent of those eligible casting their votes. Nationally voter turnout reached 70.1 percent, respectable but still 0.4 percentage points less than in 2011. The average age of the MPs fell slightly to 47.3, and there are now 34 MPs under the age of 35. The youngest is 24, while the oldest is 74. Although the number of women in Parliament decreased by three, many young women won seats, including Razmyar, Li Andersson (Left Alliance) and Susanna Koski (National Coalition Party).<p><p>By Peter Marten, April 2015<p><p>Solving the government puzzle<p><p>Progress continues nonetheless<p>", "time": "2015-05-06T20:08:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Inside the 2015 Finnish parliamentary election - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/inside-the-2015-finnish-parliamentary-election/", "review": "", "content": "<p>What should you expect to see during and after the 2015 Finnish parliamentary election? Unto Hämäläinen, a political reporter at Finland’s largest daily, Helsingin Sanomat, makes it all easy to figure out.<p><p>Finnish parliamentary election takes place on April 19, 2015. Right after that, the parties commence negotiations to form a coalition government, which can probably get down to business as early as May. A new Parliament is elected every four years, and according to established practice, the government coalition sticks together for the whole four-year term. Traditions notwithstanding, changes took place in the government in 2010, a year before the previous election, as well as in 2014, but in both cases the new government continued to follow the same programme until the end of the term. In the run-up to the 2015 election, the government of Prime Minister Alexander Stubb of the moderate conservative National Coalition Party consists of two large parties (the National Coalition and the Social Democrats) and two small parties (the Swedish People’s Party and the Christian Democrats). These four parties possess an exceptionally narrow majority: 102 members of the 200-member Parliament.<p><p>Social Democratic Party chair Antti Rinne (left) and Minister of Justice Anna-Maja Henriksson (right, Swedish People’s Party) posed recently at an education trade fair with a giant chicken (centre, political affiliation unknown).Photo: Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva<p><p>It seems clear that cooperation between the National Coalition and the Social Democrats cannot continue in the new government. Relations between the two parties have been on the rocks, especially during the year preceding the election. Social Democratic party chair Antti Rinne, also Minister of Finance prior to the 2015 election, has said publicly that he considers it unlikely that the two parties could work together in the post-election government. A poll by Finnish national broadcasting company Yle found that both parties have lost some support. Based on that survey, the big winner in 2015 is shaping up to be the conservative Centre Party, which is projected to receive 56 places in the Parliament, 21 more than previously. After losing 16 places in 2011, the Centre spent 2011 to 2015 as part of the opposition. The Centre Party’s companion in the opposition was the populist “Finns” Party, which won 39 seats in 2011, a jump of 34 that made it the biggest winner on the day. Despite posting an exceptionally good result, the “Finns” remained an opposition party because of their strong disagreement with the EU’s support of Greece and Portugal. As far as 2015 is concerned, the “Finns” and their chair Timo Soini have announced that the party would be ready for the responsibility of being part of the government coalition. Their chances are good if the party can maintain the support it enjoyed during the previous election. The polls say that the “Finns” have lost just a little bit of ground.<p><p>In January 2015, party leaders Timo Soini (left, “Finns” Party), Alexander Stubb (National Coalition), Antti Rinne (Social Democrats) and Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) gathered for a panel discussion held by the Federation of Finnish Industries.Photo: Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva<p><p>It’s probable that Finland will see a government made up of three large parties, totalling about 120 seats. If the opinion polls are right, Finland’s next prime minister may be Juha Sipilä of the Centre Party, a fresh face on the Finnish political scene. Sipilä was first elected to Parliament in 2011 and became party chair a year later. The 54-year-old previously worked as a managing director and entrepreneur in the IT business. The Centre would have to choose two partners out of the other three parties that have large followings – the “Finns” Party, the Social Democrats and the National Coalition. One of the three will find itself in the opposition. Some of the smaller parties can top off the government, as has been the practice in Finland for decades. For example, the Swedish People’s Party has been in the government for 36 years, although it only has ten members of Parliament. The foremost challenge for the new government will be the economy. According to the Ministry of Finance, the Finnish national economy is in an “extremely difficult situation.” Very slow growth is predicted for the 2015–2019 term. Finnish exports are likely to suffer in coming years as a result of Russia’s weak economic situation. The Bank of Finland estimates a 4.4 percent decline in the Russian gross domestic product during 2015 if oil prices don’t change. Professor Pekka Sutela of Lappeenranta University of Technology in eastern Finland is a Finnish expert on the Russian economy. He estimates that Finnish exports to Russia could fall by half. In recent years, Russia has accounted for 8 percent of Finland’s total exports.<p><p>Christian Democratic Party chair Päivi Räsänen (right) and her Social Democratic counterpart Antti Rinne take their seats before a multiparty debate at Helsinki University in March 2015.Photo: Martti Kainulainen/Lehtikuva<p><p>Weak economic growth would mean the Finnish public economy remaining at a deficit for the whole of the next parliamentary term. The Finnish state would continue to accumulate debt. It’s estimated that, by 2019, state debt could rise to 124 billion euros, equal to 53 percent of the gross domestic product. Going into the election, the budget deficit stood at a little less than 100 billion euros. The new government must achieve big public-economy spending cutbacks. Education, social programmes and healthcare form the largest expenditures in the Finnish state budget. All the major parties have announced that they are ready to make several billion euros’ worth of cuts to budget expenditures. The National Coalition Party has proposed tax cuts in addition to the budget cuts. This idea is supported by the Federation of Finnish Industries as well. The Centre, the Social Democrats and the “Finns” don’t support big tax cuts, and are prepared to keep tax rates unchanged. It’s probable that the new government will make decisions about budget cuts right at the beginning of the term, but that they will be carried out towards the end of the term in 2018 and 2019. Many experts on the economy have recommended building such a delay into the way budget cuts take effect, so that domestic demand will not drop off.<p><p>A gaggle of Finnish party leaders from eight different parties awaits the TV spotlight backstage.Photo: Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva<p><p>Only one sector can be sure that it won’t experience cuts. The parties all believe that defence spending will increase significantly in the next few years. “Our security policy operating environment has changed,” said Prime Minister Alexander Stubb in a speech on March 24, 2015. “We must remain vigilant.” Finland has started negotiations with Sweden about defence cooperation. The aim is not to construct a military alliance, but rather to seek synergies and develop peace-time cooperation. When the new government writes its government programme, it is set to include a mention of cooperation with Nato. Since 1994, Finland has been in Nato’s Partnership for Peace, and aims to continue active cooperation with Nato. However, Finland won’t be pursuing Nato membership, at least not anytime soon. Out of the larger parties, the Centre, the Social Democrats and the “Finns” do not support membership, while the National Coalition does. Among the smaller parties, the Left Alliance, the Greens and the Christian Democrats are against membership, but the Swedish People’s Party is for it.<p><p>By Unto Hämäläinen, April 2015<p><p>Seeking cooperation<p><p>Politics makes strange bedfellows<p><p>An unsurprising need for budget cuts<p><p>To Nato or not to Nato?<p>", "time": "2015-04-03T09:10:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Finland and Russia: Expertise through experience - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finland-and-russia-expertise-through-experience/", "review": "", "content": "<p>As Russia’s significance re-emerges in world politics and economics, can the Finns still claim to be the West’s foremost experts on their neighbour?<p><p>With a common border more than 1,300 kilometres long, Finland has always been closely tied to its eastern neighbour. From being a part of the tsarist empire to becoming the Soviet Union’s capitalist confidant, the country can boast generations of people intimately familiar with the Russian business and policy environment.<p><p>Moreover, as Timo Vihavainen, professor of Russian studies at the University of Helsinki maintains, “The two nations do share certain cultural traits, such as fondness of sauna, dachas (country cottages), and – of course – vodka. This affinity creates a sense of connectedness which has been helpful in finding common ground.”<p><p>With the post-communist state’s re-emerging importance in world politics and economics, can the Finns still vaunt themselves as the West’s leading experts on Russia?<p><p>Markku KivinenPhoto: University of Helsinki / Aleksanteri Institute<p><p>When the Cold War ended, academic research on Russia was scaled down in most western countries. In Finland, however, the opposite was true. The mid-1990s saw the founding of the Aleksanteri Institute, a research centre affiliated to the University of Helsinki focusing solely on the former Soviet bloc countries. This chimes well with the University’s history. Founded in 1640 as the Royal Academy of Turku, it was relocated to Helsinki by Tsar Alexander I and renamed the Imperial Alexander University.<p><p>Concentrating mostly on social sciences and humanities, the Institute publishes widely on Russian politics, economics and society. Despite some claims that the Finns possess no exclusive knowledge in these areas, Professor Markku Kivinen, director of the Institute, aims high: “In research, instruction and expertise pertaining to Russia and eastern Europe, the Institute is one of the largest establishments in Europe and as a research institution has the ambition to become the most important one.”<p><p>In commerce, Finland’s geographic advantage is obvious. At present, one third of Russia’s imports go through Finland and although almost 60 percent of Finnish trade takes place within the EU, Russia remains Finland’s single most important export destination. But apart from mere logistics, the origins of Finnish easterly business expertise stem from the Soviet era (while some branches of commerce have been Russia-oriented since the 19th century).<p><p>After the Second World War, Finland was forced to pay the Soviet Union sizeable war reparations, mostly in industrial products. These reparations later formed a basis for Finnish-Soviet trade. In contrast to Soviet trade with other western nations, which was conducted in hard currency, Finnish-Soviet trade was based on bilateral clearing agreements. Consequently, Finland was the Soviet Union’s most important western trading partner for decades, surpassed only by West Germany from the early 1970s onwards. Even in the early 1980s, over a quarter of Finnish exports still went to the socialist state.<p><p>This largely politically determined and export-focused trade was ruptured with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. However, the past 10 years have witnessed the emergence of new kinds of economic ties. Besides trading, Finnish companies now also invest in Russia.<p><p>For instance, the Russian market takes 17 percent of the production of Nokian Tyres, making the firm the market leader in high-end winter tyres in the country. Stockmann, a retail concern, has spearheaded the development of western-style department stores in Russia for 15 years. Given the history of commercial links, the Finns claim to possess special knowledge of the local market and administration that other foreign investors lack.<p><p>However, some fear that this competitive edge is under threat. As the seasoned Soviet trade specialists age, know-how is disappearing year by year. “At the moment, there is no generation to whom we could transfer the current knowledge,” one expert told Helsingin Sanomat, a Finnish daily.<p><p>One attempt to address the issue has been via the 2004-2007 Russia Programme of the Finnish National Fund for Research and Development (SITRA). By offering consulting expertise and aid in networking, it has helped over 70 Finnish-based companies to expand in Russia.<p><p>Finland has also been active in promoting political cooperation between Russia and the West. In 1997, the Finns presented a major EU foreign policy initiative labelled the ‘Northern Dimension’, aimed at addressing problems common to northern Europe by intensifying collaboration among the Union members and neighbouring countries. Unorthodox for the club, Finland managed to include Russia – a non-member – in the elaboration of the policy content. The process was taken further during the Finnish EU presidency in the latter half of 2006.<p><p>During its chairmanship, Finland also played a vital role in opening dialogue between the bloc and Russia on energy policy and initiated renewal of the bilateral EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.<p><p>A railway line from Helsinki to St Petersburg was opened in 1870. This picture from the early 20th century shows the station at Kouvola, SE Finland, one of the stops along the line.Photo: The National Museum of Finland<p><p>As with business, understanding Finland’s political role in EU-Russia relations requires a historical perspective. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when Finland was still an autonomous Grand Duchy of imperial Russia, the country’s political leaders assumed a pragmatic approach in dealing with the Tsarist rulers. The aim was to prevent infringements on Finland’s self-rule by assuring the Russians that both countries would benefit from peaceful coexistence.<p><p>The same ‘bend-but-don’t-break’ doctrine was also adhered to after World War II, when Finland tried to maintain its independence as a small capitalist nation at the doorstep of a communist military superpower. This necessitated compliance with many Soviet post-war demands, including signing a treaty obliging Finland to resist attacks by “Germany and its allies” (i.e. NATO) against itself or against the Soviet Union through Finland.<p><p>Critics of the doctrine, both Finnish and foreign, called it ‘Finlandisation’ – a derogatory term that referred to the way Finns moderated their foreign and domestic policy to match the values they thought the Soviets would prefer and approve. Those most concerned with the issue feared that the entire western Europe would fall under Soviet influence. To this day, Finlandisation remains a sensitive issue in Finnish public discourse.<p><p>When the military competition between two nuclear alliances came to an end, Finland quickly anchored itself to the West by joining the EU. A friendly relationship with the new Russia was retained via treaties on general cooperation and trade.<p><p>With the EU’s recent enlargement to former Soviet bloc countries, the number of Union members with extensive political experience of Russia has multiplied. However, according to Hiski Haukkala, a researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, Finland differs from others precisely in its historically rooted tendency to pragmatism. “Unlike many central and eastern European countries traumatised by communist-era experiences, Finland’s relationship with Russia has always been based on realistic and down-to-earth interaction. This has been instrumental in building trust towards Finnish policies among Russian elites.”<p><p> <p><p><p><p> <p><p>By Otto Utti, January 2007<p><p>Academic aspirations<p><p>Business as usual<p><p>Political competence<p><p>Pragmatic approach<p><p>Recent books on Russia in Finnish<p>", "time": "2015-03-30T11:08:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Demystifying Finnish dairy food - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/demystifying-finnish-dairy-food/", "review": "", "content": "<p>A visit to the dairy section of a Finnish supermarket can initially be an overwhelming experience, with a range of products that may seem unfamiliar at first glance. We shed some light on the Finnish dairy industry so that you don’t need to cry over unspilt milk.<p><p>The Finns love milk. In fact, Finland’s passion for dairy can be traced back to 2500 BC, according to recent research by the Universities of Bristol and Helsinki. Did you know that Finns consume one of the highest amounts of milk per capita in the world?<p><p>“The consumption of milk per person is about 130 litres per year,” affirms Anni Lehtonen, a licensed dietician from the Dairy Nutrition Council. “This means 3.55 decilitres per person, every day.”<p><p>This love of milk begins at an early age. “Finns get used to drinking and eating dairy products during childhood,” Lehtonen explains. “Dairy products are a huge part of Finnish food culture and agriculture.”<p><p>Finns consume about 130 litres of milk per capita per year.Photo: Finnish Dairy Nutrition Council<p><p>Lehtonen is the Dairy Nutrition Council’s current Milk Ambassador, visiting schools and workplaces to inform people about “healthy food choices, lifestyle and, of course, milk nutrition,” she says.<p><p>Active promotion of dairy products may go some way to explaining why they hold a prominent place in Finnish households. But what else is on offer?<p><p>Finns are also partial to enjoying a glass of piimä, which is close to what English speakers call buttermilk, with their meals. In fact, this and similar products add another 25 litres per person to the annual total consumption per person of liquid dairy here.<p><p>“We have many different dairy products in Finland,” Lehtonen says. “Sour milk products like piimä are ‘the most Finnish’. These also include curd milk [viili], homemade-style cheese [kotijuusto] and bread cheese [leipäjuusto, which actually isn’t bread at all] from Lapland.”<p><p>In addition, a wide variety of yogurts, cheese and ice creams can be found in Finnish homes, as well as quark [rahka], a fermented milk product familiar to many Europeans. Finland is also a leader in devoting research, production and shelf-space to low-lactose or lactose-free variations of milk and many other dairy products.<p><p>For vegans and others with specific health or ideological concerns, stores also offer milk lookalikes made from soybeans, oats, almonds, rice, hazelnuts and even buckwheat.<p><p>Three Finnish classics – milk, oatmeal and berries – taste good together.Photo: Sanna Peurakoski/Finnish Dairy Nutrition Council<p><p>We are always told milk is good for you, but extensive research in Finland contributes to actively fortifying this idea. Valio, the company with the biggest dairy-product market share locally, is 100-percent owned by Finnish farmers, and is also at the forefront of research and development.<p><p>People have a propensity to seek out functional foods these days, and Valio has developed a range of dairy products that boast positive health effects for the consumer. The leading innovation has been to integrate the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG into dairy products. The world’s most documented probiotic, this bacterium survives in the human gastrointestinal tract, protecting the body against infections and imbalances. The products are sold under the trademarks LGG and Gefilus.<p><p>Gefilus made its first appearance on the market way back in 1990. A range of Valio LGG Gefilus products is now sold in more than 50 countries around the world.<p><p>“One of the reasons Valio is successful is that it is able to develop and apply technologies to meet consumers’ shifting needs,” says Ross Crittenden, the company’s senior vice president of research and development. “Examples include separations technologies which allow Valio to produce high-protein dairy products to meet emerging nutrition and consumer demands, and Zero Lactose products that solve a requirement for lactose-intolerant consumers without compromising on taste.”<p><p>Finnish dairy achievements are enabled by “a high-quality hygiene system and legislation pertaining to dairy products – from the farm to the table,” Lehtonen says.<p><p>We’re willing to bet that no other country has as many varieties of buttermilk (piimä) as Finland. Photo: Valio <p><p> <p><p>Here’s a handful of items found on many Finnish shopping lists:<p><p>Piimä Finnish sour milk, similar to buttermilk.<p><p>Viili Versatile curd milk that can be enjoyed as a dessert or a savoury accompaniment.<p><p>Rahka Fermented milk product, similar to firm yoghurt, used in desserts.<p><p>Lactose-free products Finland has pioneered a range of products that cater to people who are lactose intolerant.<p><p>Leipäjuusto This “Finnish squeaky cheese” from Lapland is delicious served warm, accompanied by a dollop of cloudberry jam. <p><p> <p><p>By James O’Sullivan, March 2015<p><p>Dairy in their bones<p><p>A taste for research<p>", "time": "2015-03-04T12:22:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Finland’s Northern Lights viewfinder - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finlands-northern-lights-viewfinder/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Thomas Kast is freezing. Blackness surrounds him. It’s three o’clock in the morning. He’s standing in a snowy forest glade in the middle of nowhere, waiting for the Northern Lights, also known as Aurora Borealis. You can see the resulting photos in our slideshow below.<p><p>Kast is exhausted. The thermometer shows 18 degrees below zero Celsius (zero degrees Fahrenheit). His eyes scour the night sky. His camera is displaying early signs of freezing up. For hours he’s been standing in the cold, hoping to experience a moment of magic: the appearance of the Northern Lights.<p><p>Originally from near Karlsruhe, Germany, Kast has lived in Finland since 2000 and works for a major mobile network company based in Oulu, a university town of 190,000 people about 200 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle. He came to Finland for career reasons and wound up staying after he met the love of his life. After his family, the Northern Lights form his other great passion.<p><p>A camera, a tripod, spare batteries, a torch and a flask of tea: That’s about all he needs when he sets out into the night – apart from three or four layers of clothing and warm boots, of course.<p><p>“The worst thing is the cold fingers,” Kast says. It’s impossible to operate the camera’s small buttons wearing thick thermal gloves.<p><p>Kast logs hundreds of kilometres each year seeking out the Aurora Borealis all over northern Finland.Photo: Thomas Kast/Salamapaja<p><p>Before he heads out, the Northern Lights obsessive pores endlessly over various websites giving predictions of where to catch the Aurora Borealis. A blur of tables, graphs and figures demands to be deciphered and correlated. Geomagnetic fields, wind speeds, the surface activity of the sun and many other factors influence his decision. And you need patience and, if possible, absolute darkness. Even streetlights can hinder visibility.<p><p>“And then the weather has to play along,” he says. “Recently, unbelievably strong auroras were being predicted, but what good is that if the sky here in Oulu is covered with clouds? Then there’s no chance of seeing the lights.”<p><p>Sometimes Kast journeys for hundreds of kilometres just to enjoy cloud-free skies somewhere in northern Finland – just to capture the mesmerising Northern Lights. More than 60 freezing nights resulted in hundreds, maybe even thousands of photographs, from which Kast created a time-lapse video entitled Aurora: Queen of the night.<p><p>With the green, yellow and orange Northern Lights visible on the horizon, Kast shows the nightly movement of the stars by combining a sequence of 200 photos into one.Photo: Thomas Kast/Salamapaja<p><p>The Northern Lights don’t lend themselves to being filmed. A still photo with a long exposure time is required to capture them, so Kast made a time-lapse video instead. “In this respect, the human eye is far superior to technology,” he says.<p><p>What began as a hobby now takes up an increasing amount of space in his life. He blogs about it, offers Aurora Borealis trips for tourists and has published a calendar of his photos.<p><p>Oulu’s Tietomaa Science Centre bought Kast’s four-minute film and shows it on a screen eight metres long and four metres high (26 by 13 feet). “The film is a long-held dream come true”, says Sampo Puoskari, Tietomaa’s liaison coordinator.<p><p>“For several years we’ve wanted to set up a special exhibition about the Northern Lights in our region. That’s important to us. The video has finally made that possible. We set up a special space in the centre’s 45-metre (148-foot) tower.”<p><p>Kast says that displays of the Northern Lights can still leave him at a loss for words.Photo: Thomas Kast/Salamapaja<p><p>Kast stands before the huge screen in the otherwise pitch-black space and gazes, entranced, at his time-lapse sequences. His eyes shine.<p><p>“It’s really amazing to see your own pictures this big,” he says. “I hope that I manage to share some of my fascination with the Northern Lights through this film, that people become inspired to see the phenomenon for themselves.”<p><p>He still finds it magical when he sees the Aurora Borealis dancing in the night sky with his own eyes. The cold and exhaustion are forgotten. “Sometimes it’s so magnificent that I’m rendered speechless with awe,” he says.<p><p>There’s no way he’ll ever get bored with it. “It’s different every time. It’s mesmerising every time.”<p><p>Photos: Thomas Kast/Salamapaja<p><p>The lady turns heads<p><p>Spellbound Photo: Thomas Kast/Salamapaja<p><p>Spinning Milky Way Photo: Thomas Kast/Salamapaja<p><p>The long wait<p><p>Silent Auroras Photo: Thomas Kast/Salamapaja<p><p>Weekend reflection<p><p>6:31 am<p><p>Green-white sea<p><p>Overwhelming<p><p>Rock the Milky Way<p><p>Speechless<p><p>Line of fire<p><p>By Tarja Prüss<p><p>Mesmerising journeys<p><p>Long exposure time<p><p>Speechless<p><p>This is why people chase the Northern Lights<p>", "time": "2015-03-03T09:03:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Finnish skiers go with the snow flow - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-skiers-go-with-the-snow-flow/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Not only is Finland the land of 188,000 thousand lakes, but every winter thousands of kilometres of ski tracks criss-cross the country. The age-old tradition of cross-country skiing remains dynamic, in part because of the young urbanites who are increasingly turning to the sport for its convenience and low budget threshold.<p><p>Cross-country skiing was invented in Scandinavia and can be traced back 5,000 years, according to the International Ski Federation. The sport offers great exercise and countless vistas of untouched nature, just like it says in all the guidebooks about Finland.<p><p>The sun sets slowly as a skier moves across the frozen water with city buildings in the background.Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>Skis used to be made of solid wood and weigh more, but that gave way to various synthetic materials that gained popularity in the 1970s. Skiing technique has also developed: Finnish skier Pauli Siitonen, who won the Swedish long-distance race Vasaloppet in 1973, is credited with acting as one of the original pioneers of a “skating” style, in which the skier stepped out of the machine-prepared tracks in the snow and pushed off at an angle, instead of keeping both skis in the parallel grooves.<p><p>American Bill Koch popularised the style when he won the 1982 World Cup season. The arrival of the new technique gave rise to furore in the skiing world, but it soon became recognised as the fastest non-motorised way for humans to propel themselves across snow.<p><p>For serious skiers, this change of style demanded a new set of equipment as well as a considerable learning curve. The skating posture means that your skis angle outwards in a “V” shape, with your arms working in tandem to help propel you. Many young skiers find this a simple method to start with, especially in a country like Finland where ice skating is also popular.<p><p>With the growth of Finland’s urban areas apparently undiminished by the economic slowdown, the population of Finns and foreigners migrating to the capital area is quite significant. For young urbanites cross-country skiing offers a cheap solution to the problem of outdoor activity in winter.<p><p>It could be argued that this skier resembles some sort of bug – but once you try cross-country skiing through the wintery Finnish landscape, you won’t look back.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>University of Helsinki student Antony Starr grew up in a family where everyone skied, and now sees it as a good winter substitute for jogging. “Helsinki is an excellent place to ski,” he says. “There are three or four options near where I live in the neighbourhood of Viikki [on the outskirts of the city]. I try to cover 10 to 12 kilometres when I go out, but it depends on the weather as well as my schedule.<p><p>“Minus ten degrees Celsius [14 degrees Fahrenheit] is my limit – although once you’re warmed up, even that is not too chilly.”<p><p>Finlandia Ski, the most prestigious of the country’s mass participation ski events, attracted 5200 skiers in 2014. The race has a long history as a venue in the calendar of serious skiers. Held in the southern Finnish town of Lahti, it forms part of the international long-distance ski race circuit and draws hundreds of foreign participants. The majority of the contestants skate-ski their way along Finlandia Ski’s 50-kilometre route.<p><p>Once mastered, the skating technique gives a modestly healthy skier the means to travel at 10 to 12 kilometres per hour for sustained periods, while the pros are, as you’d expect, quite a bit faster. The winners of Finlandia Ski finish the course in about two hours and 20 minutes. Nowadays it’s the norm for the traditionalists in their tracks to be overtaken by athletic young bodies wrapped in skin-tight bespoke ski clothing, scything across the terrain.<p><p>They don’t care that their bulging goggles and long, flailing poles make them resemble a species of high-tech arachnid.

Now we delve into student culture with a look at the important role of student associations.<p><p>The Latin phrase pro bono publico translates to “for the common good.” That is the main principle of the people active in associations and clubs. The Finnish Patent and Registration Office lists a total of 130,000 associations in Finland with a legal minimum of three members per association. On top of it all, there are also thousands of unregistered associations. Hundreds of thousands of Finns take part, and one of the most visible groups are students.<p><p>Outdoor fun: This game of snow soccer is brought to you by student associations at Jyväskylä University.Photo: Petteri Kivimäki/Jyväskylä University<p><p>Student associations at universities take various forms. Some have a niche in a certain hobby or activity, whether it is camping, sports, music, theatre or dancing – and the list goes on. Any subject that you study is likely to have its own association.<p><p>Most student associations concentrate on creating a counterbalance to studying by organising small-scale social events for their members. They might visit organisations, companies or museums, attend conventions, take trips abroad or hold gatherings and parties. Small associations often form part of a larger association encompassing a whole department, which in turn organises events for everyone in the department.<p><p>The next level is the interdisciplinary associations, most of them called “nations,” which organise events for students who come from a certain geographic area of Finland. These larger associations are often independent, but usually receive some sort of support from their umbrella organisations, the student unions.<p><p>Students chat over a cup of coffee at a start-of-the-year mixer event.Photo: Petteri Kivimäki/Jyväskylä University<p><p>Student unions in Finland have a legislative role to act in the best interests of their members and conduct student guardianship. The issues can include higher education, social politics and international affairs. This is why they are financially independent from the universities.<p><p>Membership is mandatory in Finnish universities and costs 50 to 150 euros depending on the institution. However, the universities of applied sciences are exempt and need to recruit members in order to fund their operations.<p><p>Student unions are in turn part of the national umbrella corporations National Union of University Students in Finland (known by its Finnish abbreviation, SYL) and the Union of Students in Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences (SAMOK). These organisations work for students’ common interests nationwide and also towards the European Union through the European Students’ Union (ESU).<p><p>You have to graduate sometime: Students don wreaths and fancy clothing for the traditional graduation procession.Photo: Petteri Kivimäki/Jyväskylä University<p><p>Becoming a member of a single committee or workgroup in an association or student union is one of the first steps to becoming active.<p><p>After some experience, you can become an executive board member for an association, which teaches various important skills such as taking responsibility, organisation, teamwork, budgets, planning meeting agendas, running meetings and taking meeting notes. In short: the basic skills you should know for almost any type of career.<p><p>This offers a very interesting way to participate in student life. You’ll have the opportunity to plan what, when, where and how an event will take place. You’ll get to know a lot of people from your own and other organisations. That is ultimately the best thing about being active in student associations: meeting and building life-long relationships with like-minded people that love to have fun.<p><p>By Lasse Mäki-Hokkonen, February 2015<p><p>Associating with associations<p><p>In the students’ best interests<p><p>A career in student life<p>", "time": "2015-02-12T07:31:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

The bright, breezy summers of my childhood must have been wonderful, my friends say, but how did I manage the winter months in Helsinki?<p><p>Finns pay a lot of attention to winter sports, the comforting glow of candles and even therapeutic lamps, but to me, our seasonal pastries offer the greatest degree of psychological warmth. While ice cream stands and sun-ripened berries mark Finnish summers, our winters are punctuated by holidays that each include a sweet, culturally distinctive pastry.<p><p>In December we twist dough into Christmas stars (joulutorttu) with plum jam in the middle, around Shrovetide we fill sweet buns with almond paste and whipped cream (laskiaispulla), and we feast on funnel cakes (tippaleipä) to celebrate May Day. On the birthday of our national poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804–1877), February 5, we serve small crumb cakes topped with raspberry jam.<p><p>Despite its celebratory context, the Runeberg cake was in fact born as an exercise in frugality. Money was often tight in the Runeberg household, and faced with the added challenge of J.L.’s picky eating habits, his wife Fredrika (1807–1879) took creative license with her recipes. As the poet demanded, she flavoured his daily breakfast cakes with punch and topped them with homegrown fruit, but incorporated crumbs from leftover bread and cakes into the dough itself.<p><p>An American muffin mould does the trick, though it’s not as deep as a real Finnish Runeberg cake form. Photo: Laura Palotie<p><p>To this day, the recipe allows for flexibility, from the variety of alcohol to the kinds of crumbs used, and invites a casual baker to experiment – even if he or she lives on the other side of the globe. I thus decided to use this year’s Runeberg Day as an opportunity to introduce my friends to Finland’s legacy of holiday pastries.<p><p>I picked up eggs, wheat flour, sugar, butter, cream, almonds, cardamom and raspberry jam from my local grocery store, and opted for crushed butter cookies as my crumb of choice. I used all-American muffin moulds to give shape to the cakes.<p><p>The concept of smashing crumbs to make a fresh pastry encountered approving nods from my three friends who had joined me for an afternoon of baking, but it was the use of cardamom that triggered the strongest reactions. “This is like something you’d find at an Indian restaurant,” one of my guests commented as he helped me mix a spoonful of cardamom into the dough.<p><p>Ready to eat: This stack of American-made Runeberg tortes is fresh out of the oven. Photo: Laura Palotie<p><p>“It tastes like an almond cookie, except it’s more cakey,” one guest noted. Another suggested that I vary the recipe, perhaps by substituting cinnamon for cardamom or replacing plain cookie crumbs with crushed chocolate chip cookies.<p><p>As we poured cups of tea and discussed the origin of Runeberg Day, we were hard-pressed to find a similar tradition in the US. Not much time is devoted to celebrating American poets, especially outside of the classroom, and short of pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving, few holidays are associated with a traditional pastry. It’s even more difficult to find a popular pastry named after a historical figure.<p><p>In Fredrika Runeberg’s fashion, I’ve tried starting off each morning with a homemade pastry, and I’ve been thankful that I’m not asked to share them with a grouchy poet-husband. And, as during my childhood in Finland, their mixture of crunchy almond bits, dry crumbs and tangy raspberry reminds me of early February, the coldest time of the year, when the frosty sunlight shines just a bit brighter than the month before.<p><p>By Laura Palotie<p><p>[There are many variations on the Runeberg cake recipe. Two of the tastiest can be found on Desserts for Breakfast and Vagabond Baker.]<p><p>Experimental baking<p><p>Start the morning right<p>", "time": "2015-01-27T09:35:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Active winter Helsinki - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/active-winter-helsinki/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The Finnish capital hosts a wide variety of outdoor activities during the cooler months, ranging from cycling and ice skating to more exotic pastimes such as Nordic walking and ice-swimming.<p><p>I bicycle to work – year round. People are often surprised to hear this, as Finland’s winter is not among the world’s mildest. But it’s actually much easier than it sounds. Helsinki’s extensive network of bicycle and pedestrian paths are well maintained (ploughed and sanded) throughout the snowy season. Add to that a bike with studded tires and bright lights, reflective gear, and I’m set to go.<p><p>My six-kilometre route runs through parks and along the waterfront, so in addition to getting some exercise and fresh air first thing in the morning, I can enjoy some natural scenery along the way. By cycling to work, I’m also practicing the quintessentially Finnish concept of hyötyliikunta, which means getting the “benefit of exercise” from a daily task, for example, walking to the store instead of driving, skiing to school instead of taking the bus, etc.<p><p>I would love to say that, like a hearty Finn, I also stop for a quick dip in the sea, followed by a trip to the sauna. Unfortunately that’s not the case, but I can tell you that no discussion of winter activities here in the North would be complete without mentioning ice-swimming.<p><p>Whatever the weather: Ice-swimmers claim to have found the secret to a long life. Photo: Päivi Parikka<p><p>Ice-swimming (avantouinti in Finnish) is enjoyed at lakes or seasides during the winter months from October to April. Participants walk out onto a dock or along a mat to the swimming area, which consists of a large hole drilled into the ice, and go for a quick, invigorating dip, followed by a hot steamy sauna afterwards (though some diehards skip the sauna).<p><p>Many Finns claim that avantouinti is the secret to health and longevity, as the cold and hot extremes increase the circulation and the heart rate, which causes a rush of endorphins that are said to have an anti-depressant effect. Foreigners and Finns alike get hooked. The only downside to the popularity of ice-swimming is that many Helsinki sauna and avantouinti societies have long waiting lists, a bit of a challenge if you want to become a member and use their facilities.<p><p>Ice skating is always popular. Helsinki’s Ice Park skating rink is located next to the Railway Station, right in the heart of the city.<p><p>This is the Finnish capital’s version of New York’s Rockefeller Center ice rink. Here you can rent skates or bring your own, have a hot chocolate at the onsite café and enjoy a variety of activities, such as skating with friends, curling or listening to a live concert by a local band. As the rink is open until 9 pm every evening (Sundays until 6 pm) you can skate under the moonlight or the stars if it’s a clear night. Skating costs six euros for adults; children under 18, students and seniors pay four euros. Skate rental is six euros; helmets are recommended for children and can be borrowed at no extra cost.<p><p>The city also maintains dozens of other rinks throughout the city. Another popular one, also with skate rental available, is located in the Kallio neighbourhood and known as Brahe Rink. Although its opening hours are less predictable, it is much larger and reserves half its space for ice hockey players.<p><p>Nordic walking was initially developed in Finland and grew out of the need to provide off-season training for the Finnish cross-country ski team. Essentially, Nordic walking is walking with poles that resemble ski poles. Because of the larger stride that you can take and the added exercise that your arms and body receive, you get more of a workout.<p><p>Nordic walking can be done year round; the poles are especially handy for extra balance and agility when terrain is uneven or icy, as it often is in the wintertime.<p><p>If you prefer to swim and sauna indoors, there’s an excellent network of well-maintained modern public swimming pools in the greater Helsinki area. For something different, try Yrjönkatu Swimming Hall, which is reminiscent of an ancient Roman bath. The city’s oldest indoor pool, it was built in 1928. Restored several years ago, the pool is surrounded by several levels where the changing rooms, steam rooms and saunas are located. Some of the regulars have been swimming here since the mid-1900s. Men and women swim on different days, and bathing suits are optional, so it’s essential to check the schedule before you go.<p><p>By Katja Pantzar, updated January 2014<p><p>Refreshing dip<p><p>Stars on ice<p><p>Walk this way<p><p>Indoor oasis<p>", "time": "2015-01-21T13:52:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

We also look at how a tunnel connected to Finland’s deepest lake demonstrates a pioneering example of cleantech and environmental investment.<p><p>If one picture-perfect landscape is synonymous with Finland, it is the image of a vast blue lake disappearing into a horizon lined with brilliant green forest.<p><p>The Finnish dream involves having a lakeshore summer cottage, but lakes also play an important role in the day-to-day life of city dwellers.<p><p>“Lakes are culturally very important for many Finnish people,” says Seppo Rekolainen, director of the Freshwater Centre at the Finnish Environment Institute (known by its Finnish acronym, SYKE). “Even now, when most people live in cities, their roots are connected to the countryside, lakes and forest.”<p><p>Finland boasts a staggering 188,000 lakes. It is also a water-rich country in terms of water per person. “We have much more available water per capita compared to most countries in central and southern Europe,” Rekolainen states.<p><p>The winter brings skating, kick-sledding, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling and snowshoeing to frozen lake surfaces.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>The largest lake in Finland is Lake Saimaa, the pearl of the Lake District in the east of the country. At some 4,400 square kilometres, it is the fourth-largest natural freshwater lake in Europe.<p><p>The deepest lake in Finland, Lake Päijänne, reaches a depth of 95.3 metres. Stretching some 120 kilometres between the cities of Lahti and Jyväskylä, it is a popular haven for Finns. Around 16,000 cottages line its shore, with fishing, boating and trekking popular pastimes. Furthermore, a wide variety of water transport connects cities along its length.<p><p>Lake activities are not confined to the warmer months; the winter brings cross-country skiing, skating, kick-sledding, snowmobiling and snowshoeing to the frozen surfaces.<p><p>Water travels from Lake Päijänne to Helsinki through this tunnel in the bedrock (photo taken before the tunnel was finished).Photo: HSY<p><p>Lake Päijänne also provides drinking water to the around one million residents in the capital region.<p><p>“The Helsinki area is a very water-poor region,” Rekolainen says. “Lake Päijänne is the nearest big lake with very good quality water.”<p><p>When it was decided in the 1960s to tap into this resource, one obvious question needed to be asked: How can the lake water be transported to Helsinki? The answer: Build a tunnel.<p><p>Located between 30 and 100 metres underground, water travels at an average intake of 3.1 cubic metres per second downhill from the lake to the capital region through a tunnel in the bedrock. At around 120 kilometres in length, it forms the world’s second-longest continuous rock tunnel.<p><p>“It was a great innovation of its time,” states Veli-Pekka Vuorilehto, director of the water treatment division at the Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority (called HSY in Finnish). “It was a long-term solution to ensuring a water supply. We are now using only one-third of the tunnel’s capacity.”<p><p>Fishing and boating are popular on Lake Päijänne and many other Finnish lakes.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>Some of the raw water is channelled elsewhere to help improve water quality, however the lion’s share goes through the HSY water treatment plants in Pitkäkoski and Vanhakaupunki. Given that the source water is of high quality, the several stages of treatment do not include the addition of many chemicals.<p><p>Aside from the practical purpose of transporting water, the tunnel’s flow is also utilised to produce some seven million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually at the Kalliomäki hydroelectric power plant. Other innovations are also being introduced.<p><p>“By decreasing the water temperature by 0.1 degrees Celsius, we can use it to heat our water treatment plant,” Vuorilehto says. “The idea is basically the same as geothermal heat: a huge amount of water contains a huge amount of warmth.”<p><p>With many companies now heavily involved in finding more environmentally friendly ways of approaching innovations, Vuorilehto sees the Päijänne tunnel as a pioneering example of cleantech.<p><p>“We get a sufficient amount of raw water that is relatively easy and light to handle, and the environmental impacts are much smaller than if we take water from elsewhere. We also create electricity and heat. The whole tunnel is an environmental investment.”<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, January 2015<p><p>Fresh tastes from the lakes<p><p>Travelling to Helsinki<p><p>Innovative flow<p>", "time": "2015-02-06T12:14:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Maybe everyone is concentrating on the holiday shopping rush. Finns generally hang around with relatives on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. In the days that follow, they pay visits to friends and gather energy for December 31.<p><p>In Finland, as in many other places, New Year’s Eve probably forms the biggest party night of the year, although some would argue that the Finns get even wilder on April 30, the eve of May Day.<p><p>On New Year’s Eve, people host guests at home, meet up in restaurants, attend special gala dances and enjoy lively concerts. Eating well is essential on this occasion, and can mean anything from a tasty home-cooked meal to a calorie-rich buffet dinner. Many people consume quite a bit of alcohol on this night, which sometimes leads to boisterous behaviour.<p><p>Helsinkians congregate on Senate Square to celebrate New Year’s Eve and make resolutions that they may or may not remember later.Photo: Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva<p><p>An indispensable part of New Year’s Eve is fireworks. Sold in stores between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, they can only be used from 6 pm on December 31 until 2 am the next morning. At six o’clock you’ll notice the few displays of roman candles, bottle rockets and firecrackers. The frequency increases during the evening until the grand finale at midnight, when a spectacular amount of private fireworks are set off. Various towns, organisations and companies arrange public pyrotechnic shows that light up the sky.<p><p>On several occasions, I’ve watched this magnificent spectacle from the roof of an apartment building or the top floor of an office building. The best view I’ve experienced was from the Atelier Bar at the summit of the Torni Hotel (torni means “tower”). I had to arrive very early and wait for over an hour outside in the cold on the large balcony. Fortunately, the show was worth it.<p><p>National celebrations often take place on Senate Square in Helsinki, and that’s where the Finnish capital is holding this year’s New Year’s Eve events.<p><p>Huge crowds gather to listen to speeches by the Mayor, the Bishop and other dignitaries, although I’m not sure if people are actually listening. There are live performances, light shows and singing. Even though it can be extremely cold, people are very enthusiastic and happy to be there. The event is televised and finds its way into many households and bars throughout the country.<p><p>When the clock strikes midnight, people say, “Hyvää uutta vuotta!” (“Happy New Year” in Finnish) or “Gott nytt år!” (in Swedish, also one of Finland’s official languages). They toast each other with champagne or beer, shake hands, hug, kiss and say nice things to each other. Of course, most people want to start the new year on the right foot. So they make the usual resolutions, which they may not remember later, or may pretend not to remember.<p><p>In a Finnish New Year’s Eve tradition, melted tin is poured into a bucket of cold water. The resulting random shape is interpreted to predict a person’s future. Photo: Seppo Sirkka/Lehtikuva<p><p>One fun Finnish tradition is melting tin. Miniature tin horseshoes are melted in a pan and poured into a bucket of cold water. As the tin hits the water it cools and instantly resolidifies. The resulting random shapes are then interpreted to predict a person’s future health, wealth or happiness. Whenever I’ve participated in this type of fortune telling, I’ve received only positive news. In fact, everyone else did as well.<p><p>All this partying is hard work and gives you a hearty appetite. Normally, those revellers who have continued into the wee hours of the morning eat potato salad, sausages or something salty. One popular snack is Jansson’s Temptation, a casserole made of potatoes, onions, sprats or anchovies, bread crumbs and cream. Delicious!<p><p>On New Year’s Day, Finns like to sleep in late. Many will wake with an urge to take a pain reliever. However, others are up at the crack of dawn spending the first day of the year skiing, strolling through the park or getting some fresh air in a forest. It goes without saying that coffee is consumed in record quantities this day.<p><p>Popular programmes on TV include the President’s speech, the Vienna New Year’s Concert, and vintage Finnish movies. Later in the day, many people like to have a good meal. This is a great time to savour traditional Finnish fare such as fish dishes or a meat stew.<p><p>Some Finns feel this is a fine day to take it easy, but others think they should start the year’s first evening with a bang.

Our American reporter recounts his experiences of the holiday.<p><p>What I find interesting about Independence Day is the combination of solemnity and enjoyment. For example, on the serious side, you have patriotic speeches, visits to cemeteries, tributes at war memorials and special church services. Wearing their traditional white caps and carrying torches, students in Helsinki start at Hietaniemi Cemetery and walk to Senate Square, where they listen to speeches and music. The President awards medals and decorations to several thousand people for outstanding achievements.<p><p>On a lighter note, people place blue and white candles in their windows, bakeries sell blue and white pastries, shops are adorned with blue and white decorations and there are blue and white flags on display everywhere. On TV, you can hear patriotic music, listen to lively discussions and watch the legendary film The Unknown Soldier (the vintage version), an emotional story based on Väinö Linna’s eponymous novel about the Second World War.<p><p>At the President’s Independence Day Reception in 2015, war veteran Veikko Ranta, 97 at the time, shakes hands with President Sauli Niinistö as First Lady Jenni Haukio looks on. Ranta served in the Second World War.Photo: Office of the President of Finland<p><p>Finns are generally in a good mood on this day, and like to eat a festive meal with family or friends. On my first Finnish Independence Day, I went to a nice restaurant with some fellow students and ate delicious Finnish cuisine.<p><p>During the meal we talked about the meaning of freedom and about Finnish history. Prior to independence, Finland formed an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian empire for 108 years, and before that it belonged to the Swedish kingdom. During the Second World War the Finns had to defend their freedom.<p><p>We also discussed lighter subjects, enjoyed the food and savoured some wine. I found this get-together a very uplifting and elegant experience – one that should be repeated.<p><p>On Independence Day, numerous formal and informal social events happen throughout the country. However, the highlight happens in the evening, when the President holds the Independence Day Reception, a gala event for VIPs and specially selected guests. The invitees include high-ranking military officers, politicians, police officials and diplomats, as well as prominent athletes, entertainers and activists. This event is broadcast on national TV, and it seems like half the population watches it.<p><p>The TV reporters make comments about the 2,000 guests as they line up and shake hands with the President and his or her spouse on the way in. At home, people supplement the commentary with their own observations: “What a fantastic dress she has!” or “He’s not even wearing a tie!” or “She’s lost a lot of weight!” or “Who is that lady with him?”<p><p>A couple thousand guests chat, drink, dance and pose for the media at the Presidential Palace during the annual Independence Day Reception.Photo: Office of the President of Finland<p><p>Later the band starts playing and viewers can watch the guests dance, eat and drink. Reporters circulate, interviewing famous people and asking them about their ideas on independence. They usually provide good answers, although nothing earth-shaking.<p><p>After a certain point the cameras must be switched off, and the press has to stop reporting. What goes on then is of great speculation for the country, and the evening papers spend the next week treating readers to gossip from the ball – usually very tasteful gossip.<p><p>The wife of a friend of mine is fascinated by the President’s Independence Day Reception, and once insisted that they get as close to the Presidential Palace as possible so they could see the famous people getting out of their taxis.<p><p>“Isn’t this exciting!?” she asked. “Well, it might be if it wasn’t so cold and snowing so hard,” he answered, to which she replied, “Oh, stop complaining! Wow, just look at who’s getting out of that car!” And so the evening progressed.<p><p>Wearing their traditional white caps and carrying torches, students in Helsinki start at Hietaniemi Cemetery and walk to Senate Square, where they listen to speeches and music.Photo: Pauli Antero/Flickr, cc by nc nd 2.0<p><p>On the other hand, some people are not pleased about the reception. They gather across from the palace, carrying signs and shouting about the inequality of the society or other current political topics. The protesters’ numbers are usually very small.<p><p>Then there are those who organise alternative receptions and dances. Some even hold Independence Day dinners in their homes, where the guests dress up, eat a sumptuous meal and drink sparkling wine, with the President’s reception on TV in the background.<p><p>Finnish schoolchildren get an opportunity to have their own Independence Day Gala. In Helsinki, the mayor invites the city’s fourth-graders to Finlandia Hall, the landmark building designed by Alvar Aalto. My daughters wore elegant dresses and got their hair done for the occasion. The girls were accompanied by their “dates” – some of the boys were probably wearing a necktie for the first time in their lives. Quite an event for kids who are ten or eleven years old!<p><p>Everyone has her or his own way of celebrating Finland’s independence. The main point is that country worked hard to gain its freedom, and fought hard to keep it. Finns learn at a young age that self-determination should never be taken for granted. They are reminded of this every year on December 6.<p><p> <p><p>By Russell Snyder<p><p>Everyone’s in a good mood<p><p>Fascination and speculation<p><p>Alternative celebrations<p>", "time": "2014-11-28T17:28:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Swedish-speaking Finnish journalist Anna-Lena Laurén gives us an inside view of what Swedish means to Finland.<p><p>Finland-Swedish poet Henry Parland (1908–30) once wrote in a letter, “I am a foreigner wherever I go.” The writer had the sort of multifaceted background that is typical of many Finland-Swedes (Swedish-speaking Finns):<p><p>Born in Saint Petersburg, Russia to a family with Scottish roots, Parland attended school in German. Although he also knew Russian and Finnish, Swedish was his language of choice for his writing career.<p><p>Finland has had a Swedish-speaking population since the 1100s, when Swedish crusaders arrived, but Finland-Swedes possess a much broader cultural and genetic heritage. Russian, German, Scottish and Baltic blood runs in the veins of many Finland-Swedes.<p><p>Finnish flags flying: Finland-Swedes definitely don’t support Sweden at sporting events.Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>When Parland wrote about being a foreigner wherever he went, he was not only referring to his multicultural background. He probably also meant that it can be extremely difficult to explain your identity to people who believe that nationality and language are one and the same. A Finn who speaks Swedish? How did that happen?<p><p>The fact is that Finland-Swedes adamantly consider themselves Finnish. That means we’re not Swedes who live in Finland, but rather Finns whose mother tongue is Swedish. Multilingual countries are not unique – Europe also contains Belgium and Switzerland – but the misconception that a country can only have one language is still quite common.<p><p>So, never ask Finland-Swedes if they root for Finland or Sweden in ice hockey. They’ll find it downright insulting.<p><p>Foreign guests often ask why Swedish is an official language in Finland, seeing that Swedish speakers make up only about 5.5 percent of the population.<p><p>Marshal C.G. Mannerheim as painted by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, one of Finland’s most famous artists – and also a Swedish speaker (click photo for uncropped version).Photo: Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva<p><p>The answer is that the Swedish language has a cultural and historical significance in Finland that can’t be measured by percentage. For 700 years, Finland was part of Sweden, a period that brought Finland a western European social structure. Rather than becoming a feudal society it became a society made up of free farmers, in contrast to Russia and the Baltics.<p><p>When Finnish started to gain ground as a language of administration and creative arts in the 1800s, Swedish-speaking intellectuals spearheaded the process. They looked upon themselves as Finnish patriots. At the same time, Swedish maintained its cultural significance.<p><p>A very large portion of Finland’s most important literature was written in Swedish – the national anthem, for example, by national poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg. Finland’s best-known composer, Jean Sibelius, was a Swedish speaker, as was Marshal C.G. Mannerheim, who led Finland through the World Wars. In addition to his mother tongue, Mannerheim spoke Russian, German, French and English – and Finnish was actually his weakest language.

Conflict resolution represents one of Finnish society’s key strengths. Kids start learning it in comprehensive school through peer mediation training, which forms a special focus on Ahtisaari Day.<p><p>“It would be nice to mediate quarrels between others and to have harmony and peace in our school,” says sixth-year pupil Iina. Together with her classmate Oona, she has come to peer mediation training arranged at Vanttila School in Espoo. This morning they learn the first important thing about mediation: When one person is speaking, the others have a responsibility to listen.<p><p>Over 400 educational institutes – daycare centres, comprehensive schools and upper secondary schools – already have peer mediators trained by the Finnish Forum for Mediation. What’s more, similar activities have been piloted abroad – last spring a programme was held in Uganda.<p><p>The training emphasises cooperating and striving for an outcome based on mutual understanding. Effort is made to resolve the situation that has led to the conflict, so that the parties themselves take an active part in the solution.<p><p>Mediation instruction involves drama practice with a whole spectrum of emotions, from altercation to reconciliation.Photo: Laura Rautjoki<p><p>What conflicts do schools have to deal with? The blackboard starts to fill with a list ranging from scowling or hiding a classmate’s cap to pushing and even rougher physical violence. The realities of school life come to light, and everyone seems to have stories to share: someone broke a snow castle built by another pupil, someone was shoving in the lunch queue and someone was excluded from games.<p><p>Pupils who have completed the peer mediation training work in pairs to solve conflicts between their schoolmates. Once a consensus has been reached, the parties sign a pledge that the conflict will not be repeated. The mediators and the parties to the dispute meet again in a couple of weeks to ensure that the agreement has held.<p><p>The idea of settling disputes between schoolchildren seems simple, but it’s not always easy. How can the mediator remain neutral while solving the disputes of others?<p><p>Iina and Oona are attending peer mediation training in order to help maintain the atmosphere at school.Photo: Laura Rautjoki<p><p>“Some people have asked me why I don’t just mind my own business,” says ninth-year student Minea, who has now served as a mediator for three years. “I tell them that we mediators are here to make this school a nicer place.”<p><p>According to Minea and her classmate Susanna, patience is one of the most important qualities of a good mediator. There’s no reason to get upset, even if a dispute cannot be settled right away.<p><p>“I think a good mediator also helps the parties to move ahead and may even ask them for ideas about how the matter could be solved,” Susanna says.<p><p>At the end of the mediation training, the pupils of Vanttila School in Espoo, just west of Helsinki, get a diploma for their competence as mediators. The pupils get together to mull over the day’s lessons. The instructors repeat once more to the new mediators that they must maintain confidentiality and remain neutral, and that they may not distribute punishment.<p><p>With a twinkle in their eyes, the instructors refer to the students as future Nobel Peace Prize winners. The world will continue to need competent peace negotiators to solve complicated conflicts.<p><p>Ahtisaari Day takes place every autumn on or near November 10, which is the name day for Martti in the Finnish calendar. Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008, always visits several schools to meet students and give awards to mediators selected from the school community by their peers.<p><p>The prize recognises pupils, groups or even school staff members who have acted in a manner that promotes peaceful resolution of disputes. Often the award winners are newly trained peer mediators – students who work for peace at school.<p><p> <p><p>By Liisa Poussa, November 2013, updated November 2016<p><p>How to remain neutral<p><p>Helping people move ahead<p><p>Ahtisaari Day highlights mediation skills at school<p>", "time": "2014-11-06T08:46:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

The country possesses a total of 14 universities and 25 polytechnic institutes. Each university nourishes its own distinct student culture and traditions.<p><p>Different overalls indicate different departments: green from Athene, Aalto University’s information networks students’ guild, and red from Teknologföreningen, Aalto’s Swedish-speaking engineers club.Photo: Maiju Tompuri<p><p>Many Finnish student traditions are similar to those in the other Nordic countries, especially Sweden. The largest student festivity falls on April 30 and May 1, called Walpurgis in English, Vappu in Finnish and Valborg in Swedish. Every single student – and every other person in Finland, for that matter, takes part.<p><p>May Day (May 1) is also a national holiday, Labour Day. For the festivities people bring out and wear their white high school graduation caps. University students sport overalls in various colours, decorated with writing, badges, gadgets, gloves, cups, symbols, toys, tools and whatever else students might need during their adventures.<p><p>Traditions form an important part of student life: Student associations from Åbo Akademi University in Turku salute a statue of Per Brahe, founder of Finland’s first university.Photo: Max Weijola<p><p>As a garment, overalls hold more value than you’d think. The colour of your overalls is determined according to where and what you’re studying, creating a sense of unity among students. The overalls also act as outstanding icebreakers – you can always make a stereotypical joke related to a certain field of study. Rules regarding the use of overalls vary from one place to another, but luckily student events also exist for people interested in dressing more elegantly.<p><p>At annual gala dances, participants wear full evening dress. The event often consists of a three-course dinner, dancing and an after-party. The next morning a herring brunch is held, mainly to help abolish any headaches acquired the previous evening.<p><p>Students have the opportunity to participate in a myriad of these events held by multiple smaller associations, student organisations and “student nations” (similar to fraternities and sororities in the US). Time and money form the only constraints. Some may even travel to similar galas abroad, most likely to the other Nordic countries or Estonia.<p><p>Singing plays a significant role in Finnish student culture, and choirs can be found at any university. This Turku quartet called Kosteat Kosijat (The Wet Suitors) is performing at a banquet.Photo: Max Weijola<p><p>Most student unions in Finland organise large events such as the aforementioned Walpurgis Eve and annual galas, as well as festivities during Finnish Independence Day. Various welcome carnivals and fairs take place in the beginning of the year for the benefit of first-year students. Tradition dictates that an epic sledding competition takes place in the snow on Shrove Tuesday. There’s a lot to discover.<p><p>Jäynäkisa, an annual prank competition just outside of Helsinki in Otaniemi, encourages future engineers to apply their technical wit with humour. Similar contests are held at many universities, and student associations from all over Finland participate.<p><p>The name of northern Finland’s largest student event, Poronkusema, comes from an old unit of measurement that referred to the intervals at which roaming reindeer stopped to urinate. Poronkusema involves team orienteering and assignments in the city of Rovaniemi.<p><p>If you feel like calling yourself a captain of the Aura River, catch the annual pub crawl in Turku. How about a fashion show? Students at Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki organise their own runway and act as models. Want to practice your Finnish or Swedish? Schnapps songs and great company can be found at sits parties, which form a poor man’s version of the three-course gala dinner. Don’t be afraid – they may sing English songs too.<p><p>It’s possible to participate in a plethora of different festive occasions during your student life in Finland.<p><p>Of course, studying in Finland is not all fun and games. Lectures, assignments, quizzes and exams form an integral part of student life. Still, you have to have a balance. Life experience can be just as valuable as your studies.

{"title": "Iconic Finnish nature symbols stand out - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/iconic-finnish-nature-symbols-stand-out/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Many countries have an animal or bird as a national symbol, but close-to-nature Finland has seven natural symbols, including a national fish, a national tree and even a national insect. The country also celebrates Finnish Nature Day every year on the last weekend in August.<p><p>Finland’s seven magnificent national nature symbols received their status through a series of public polls that attracted tens of thousands of postal votes in the 1980s and ’90s, before the advent of instant online polls. “The reason we have so many iconic natural symbols may be that nature is very dear to the Finns, as can be seen each summer when our cities empty out as everyone heads off to their rural roots,” explains Terho Poutanen, former publicity officer of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation. The association organised several of the popular national votes together with scientific, corporate and media partners. “Our seven national nature symbols are interlinked with Finnish mythology, traditions and popular culture in various interesting ways,” he says. Many have been proudly featured on postage stamps, in organisations’ logos and on pre-euro Finnish banknotes and coins. Poutanen explains how the votes also aimed to arouse interest in nature conservation among urbanised modern Finns by giving everyone a sense of connection to certain familiar, charismatic or endangered creatures.<p><p>Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Bears feature prominently in Finnish mythology, including the national folklore epic Kalevala. Ancient Finno-Ugric peoples held bears as feared and honoured totemic animals, and Finns still often consider the bear “King of the Forest.” About 1,500 brown bears (Ursus arctos) roam Finland’s vast forests today, but they are very wary of humans and few Finns ever encounter them in the wild – though in recent years safe and sensitively organised bear-watching trips in the bear country borderlands of eastern Finland have enabled increasing numbers of Finns and foreign visitors to watch these magnificent beasts close up. Other animals that fared well in the public poll included the hunters’ favourite the moose or elk (Alces alces) and the Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis), an endangered freshwater seal found only in Finland.<p><p>Photo: Jari Peltomäki/NatureGate<p><p>The whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus) is a graceful, northern, pure white, wild swan that features in Finnish folklore and culture, from the Kalevala folk epic to the works of composer Jean Sibelius. During the early 20th century the numbers of whooper swans in the wild declined steeply, until by the 1950s fewer than twenty pairs bred in Finland. The swans have since recovered after being successfully spotlighted as a figurehead species for Finland’s nascent nature conservation movement; and today Finland is home to about 6,000 whoopers. In the springtime the sight and sound of returning flocks of migrating swans brings joy to nature-lovers across the country. Many products in Finland’s stores bear a flying swan logo from a Nordic environmental labelling scheme, or a swimming swan logo signifying food produced in Finland. Finnish euro coins feature a pair of whooper swans in flight over some quintessentially Finnish lakeland scenery.<p><p>Photo: Jouko Lehmuskallio/NatureGate<p><p>The lily-of-the valley (Convallaria majalis) was chosen as Finland’s national flower because its attractive and sweetly-scented flowers are very familiar to most Finns. These delicate clusters of white blossoms, shaped like tiny bells, bloom in early summer in moist woodlands, parks and gardens in almost all parts of the country. Perennial lily-of-the-valley plants grow so profusely that children and other nature-lovers can be encouraged to pick them while leaving rarer species to grow, though it’s worth remembering that the bright red berries that adorn them in late summer are poisonous. Lilies-of-the-valley have often featured in Finnish romantic poetry and pop songs. Their Finnish name, kielo, is also a traditional girl’s name that for some reason is also often given to amiable cows.<p><p>Photo: Jouko Lehmuskallio/NatureGate<p><p>The silver birch (Betula pendula), with its striking white bark, lush green leaves and gracefully drooping branches, is perhaps the most beautiful native tree in Finland’s forests, so it came as no surprise when the winner of the vote to choose the country’s national tree was announced in 1988. Over the ages Finns have traditionally used birch trees in many other ways than for their timber. Their sap makes a healthy mineral-rich drink. Their bark has been used to make anything from roofs to baskets, and even shoes. And the freshest, leafiest branches of young silver birches make the best possible switches for gentle flagellatory use in therapeutic sauna massages. To mark Midsummer’s Day many Finns stand two silver birch saplings outside the doorway of their home or holiday cabin, continuing an age-old tradition. And countless old Finnish romantic films feature a cliché image of a blonde Finnish maiden leaning winsomely on a birch tree by a picturesque lakeshore.<p><p>Photo: Jouko Lehmuskallio/NatureGate<p><p>With its dark stripes and bright red fins, the perch (Perca fluviatilis) is by far the most familiar and easily recognised fish found in Finnish waters. Some well-known fish only thrive in saltier marine waters, wild rivers or pristine arctic lakes, but the humble perch abounds in ponds, lakes, rivers and coastal waters all around Finland. These hungry aquatic predators can easily be caught by anyone dangling a hooked worm on a line tied to a fishing rod or the end of a branch. But they are also widely trawled and traded by Finnish commercial fishermen. Fresh perch can be seen in shops and markets around Finland. Fried, grilled or baked perch makes a tasty meal, and traditional dishes such as perch soup or rye loaf stuffed with perch are popular in many rural regions.<p><p>Photo: Karen Siren/Lehtikuva<p><p>Granite was chosen as Finland’s national rock type in a postal poll run by the Finnish Science Centre Heureka and a geological institute in 1989. Outcrops of ancient pinkish or greyish granitic bedrock two billion years old or more can be seen in almost all regions of Finland. Attractive and durable granite can also be widely seen in Finland’s cities and towns in monuments, sculptures and prominent buildings. Well-known granite buildings in Helsinki include Parliament House, the National Museum, the Central Railway Station, the National Theatre, Granite House shopping mall, and the atmospheric Temppeliaiukio Church, which is sunk into the granite bedrock that underlies the capital. Most Finns also end their days under a traditional granite gravestone.<p><p>Photo: baerchen57/flickr, cc by-nc-sa<p><p>The seven-spot ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata) was chosen as Finland’s iconic insect in 1996 through a poll publicised by a popular magazine for animal-lovers. It is an ideal choice for encouraging an interest in creepy-crawly creatures, as an easily sighted, beautifully decorated bug that does not bite or sting, but can be safely picked up and observed. Behind its choice undoubtedly lies a children’s rhyme loved by generations of Finnish kids: “Fly, fly, Ladybird, to the foot of the big stone, / There your mummy and daddy are making porridge for you.” Colourful ladybirds also feature in a logo that appears on wildlife-friendly Finnish organic produce.<p><p>By Fran Weaver, August 2014<p><p>Finland’s national animal: brown bear<p><p><p><p>Finland’s national bird: whooper swan<p><p><p><p>Finland’s national flower: lily-of-the-valley<p><p><p><p>Finland’s national tree: silver birch<p><p><p><p>Finland’s national fish: perch<p><p><p><p>Finland’s national rock: granite<p><p><p><p>Finland’s national insect: seven-spot ladybird<p>", "time": "2014-08-25T06:44:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

The water’s still warm enough for swimming, and it’s a great time to watch wildlife and find berries and mushrooms out in the forest, for instance,” explains Nieminen.<p><p> Events and publicity for the annual day are jointly led by the FANC, the Finnish Environment Institute, Metsähallitus Natural Heritage Services and a national teachers’ union. Happenings around the country include many guided nature or cultural history walks – as well as lots of activities especially planned for children. Mushrooms are an understandably popular theme at the start of the peak Finnish mushroom-picking season.<p><p> During the preceding week many schools use special teaching materials and show the hugely popular Finnish nature documentary film Metsän tarina (The Story of the Forest). For people based in the capital area, many Nature Day events happen or start at the Finnish Nature Centre Haltia, which opened in Espoo, just west of Helsinki, in May 2013.<p><p>Photo: Ismo Pekkarinen/Visit Finland<p><p> Nature Day’s logo features the whooper swan, Finland’s national bird. The recovery of these graceful waterbirds from near extinction in much of Finland is one of the country’s recent conservation success stories.<p><p> “Of course we also aim to increase awareness of nature conservation through the annual day,” says Nieminen. Recent “red list” surveys suggest that conditions in Finland’s lakes and rivers are generally very good today, but many farmland and woodland species are becoming rarer.<p><p> “We hope Nature Day will become a truly national annual event that activates teachers, kids, parents, grandparents, and everyone else – and increase their interest in nature,” he says. “It’s great that in Finland you’re never far away from natural green areas, and we encourage everyone to make the most of this.”<p><p> <p><p> By Fran Weaver, updated August 2014<p><p> Getting kids back outside<p><p> Fun with fungi<p><p> Building awareness of conservation<p>", "time": "2014-08-21T14:00:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Each January and July, a total of about 13,000 recruits travel across Finland by road, rail or air in order to reach their designated brigades and begin six to twelve months in the challenging environment of the armed forces.<p><p>In most cases, men who have dual citizenship and live abroad must also come to Finland and serve. Some travel great lengths to attend. Julio Tiusanen, who grew up in Nicaragua, is one of the annual 50 to 70 dual citizens who come to Finland to complete their military service.<p><p>While service is not compulsory for women, some of them decide to enlist. Emmie Sumelius, a Swedish speaker, comes from the southwestern Finnish city of Turku and is one of the annual 300 to 400 women that complete voluntary military service. Both Sumelius and Tiusanen served at Nyland Brigade, the only unit in Finland where service, education and training are carried out in Swedish, one of Finland’s official languages.<p><p>Julio Tiusanen, whose dad is from Finland, found in the Finnish military experience a completely new situation where he could focus on values such as discipline and test his mental and physical limits.Photo courtesy of Julio Tiusanen<p><p>Tiusanen graduated from Ave Maria University in Nicaragua with a degree in business administration prior to moving across the pond and actually visiting Finland – his father’s home country – for the first time. The decision to serve in the Finnish military felt natural to him because of his father’s experience of tackling a completely new situation where you could focus on values such as discipline and test your mental and physical limits.<p><p>Sumelius decided to volunteer in order to further develop her leadership skills. The challenges did not daunt her, as she enjoys working in a team. The discipline and the organisation also interested her, and she is now on a contract working as a second lieutenant teaching new recruits the very things she learned when she first arrived.<p><p>The Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) are not directly perceived as an educational institution, yet they offer a wide range of learning experiences. The Army, Navy and Air Force all contain a wide range of Special Forces, branches and institutions. Some conscripts have the opportunity to serve in capacities compatible with their education and work experience: chefs, physicians, lawyers, electricians, mechanics and others. For those who have not yet found their professional calling, the FDF assigns suitable duties based on tests, evaluations and an interview.<p><p>The most motivated and suitable conscripts are chosen for leadership training, either for a rank as a non-commissioned officer (NCO), or a commissioned officer in the reserves. Sumelius was selected for the Reserve Officers School while Tiusanen went to NCO School, as well as receiving special training in crisis management. Both Sumelius and Tiusanen were trained and practised leadership for ten months during their service.<p><p>Different branches of the Finnish Defence Forces use different colours of berets. Pictured here is the dark blue beret of the Navy.Photo: Marina Pettersson<p><p>Tiusanen and Sumelius appreciate the training they have received, but they put the most emphasis on how their personalities have changed for the better. Sumelius explained: “I’m more confident, more focused, mentally stronger and I have 1,000 amazing experiences and memories – and some not-so-pleasant ones.”<p><p>The sometimes harsh environment and complete exhaustion made them appreciate their friends and family and the small things in life. “I learned how to deal with different types of personalities and a different culture,” Tiusanen says. “On a deeper level, it made me realise I was stronger than I thought. No matter how difficult or distant it seems, with enough effort and determination you can achieve anything.”<p><p>For Tiusanen and Sumelius, the most memorable events happened during the most challenging situations: the 70-kilometre Green Beret March for Tiusanen, and the almost identical Leadership Exercise for Sumelius. The latter measures leadership skills and stamina, and forms the toughest march in the Reserve Officers School.<p><p>However, the best memories will always be the friends they shared their experiences with. “You meet a lot of new people from completely different backgrounds and make new friends and establish bonds that will last a lifetime,” Tiusanen says.<p><p>Do they have any regrets about their voluntary service? “Not really,” says Sumelius. “Although I had doubts many times during the service, the hard times were all worth it in the end.”<p><p>“Absolutely nothing,” says Tiusanen. “I think it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.”<p><p>Military service in Finland<p><p> <p><p>By Lasse Mäki-Hokkonen, August 2014, updated August 2018<p><p>Natural decision<p><p>Harsh tests, new friends<p>", "time": "2015-01-25T22:26:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

One fine, late-summer evening, I found myself surrounded by people with funny hats, bibs and napkins tucked into their collars. On my plate were several red crayfish, looking like miniature lobsters, flanked by sprigs of fresh dill. Next to the plate was a chunk of bread, a glass of ice-cold schnapps and a beer.<p><p>The most prized crayfish come from Finnish lakes. However, they are also imported from Turkey, Spain, China and the US.Photo: VisitFinland<p><p>That evening, we spent a lot of time singing and making toasts and, in between, we used a special fork and knife to get a small amount of meat out of each crayfish. The atmosphere was jovial and cheerful. However, due to the ratio of food to drink, I became lightheaded very soon. What I didn’t realise was that everyone except me had already eaten before coming to the event.<p><p>Crayfish parties came to Finland via Sweden. At first they were mainly observed by Swedish-speaking Finns (Swedish is one of Finland’s official languages), but the fête gradually spread to the Finnish-speaking population as well. What’s more, it was once the domain of the upper class, but became popular with Finns from every walk of life.<p><p>“Do your best but don’t worry about it.” Normal table manners don’t count at a crayfish party.Photo: Nina Ijäs/VisitFinland<p><p>The harvesting season for these beloved crustaceans begins in late July and continues until the end of October. During that time of year, especially in August, restaurants are busy with bookings for crayfish feasts. Weather permitting, they are often celebrated on an outdoor terrace or even a rooftop. These are messy occasions as people eat with their fingers – fingerbowls and dozens of napkins are required. Normal manners are overlooked on this wonderful occasion.<p><p>Besides restaurants, many Finns like to organise their own private crayfish parties, which take place in gardens, on patios, on balconies or at summer cottages. Often during these gatherings, soup, savoury pies or fish may accompany the main dish. Lanterns are sometimes hung near the table to enhance the ambience.<p><p>The most prized crayfish come from Finnish lakes. However, the amount of these highly appreciated crustaceans has diminished due to disease. Therefore, crayfish are also imported from Turkey, Spain, China and the US, although these are often considered inferior to the domestic variety. Nevertheless, most Finns are delighted to consume whatever is available.<p><p>A good crayfish party is so much fun that you don’t notice time passing until suddenly the hour is late.Photo: Nina Ijäs/VisitFinland<p><p>Personally, I consider it a real privilege to be invited to a crayfish party. The last one I attended took place in the month of October at a picturesque, venerable, wooden house by a bay in Espoo, just west of Helsinki. Before sitting at the table, we enjoyed a relaxing, wood-burning sauna, and had a swim in the cold but refreshing water. Once in the main house, we could choose from a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including beer, mineral water, soft drinks, wine, Scandinavian schnapps and Finnish vodka.<p><p>Pea soup and potato soup were served first – so we wouldn’t get hungry later during the main course. The hosts passed out song books with Swedish, Finnish, German and English drinking songs. And everyone participated by singing along. Since many of us were foreign, the Finns shared ideas with us about the best way to get the most meat out of each crayfish. I thought the best advice was, “Do your best but don’t worry about it.”<p><p>As with most parties of this kind, the conversation flowed, and there was a comfortable mood among the guests and hosts. Time almost seemed to stand still, until suddenly it was early morning and, regretfully, the party came to an end.<p><p>Isn’t it terrific how a simple-looking crayfish can bring about so much joy for so many people? Of course, the crayfish might see things a bit differently.<p><p> <p><p>By Russell Snyder, July 2014<p><p>Messy manners<p><p>An invitation is an honour<p>", "time": "2014-08-26T12:53:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Mysterious names on the map of Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/mysterious-names-on-the-map-of-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The initially unfathomable place-names that dot the map of Finland have meanings and origins that may be straightforward or less obvious.<p><p>Many Finnish place-names relate to natural features, including those of towns like Joensuu (River Mouth), Valkeakoski (White Rapids), Kalajoki (Fish River); and urban districts like Hakaniemi (Meadow Point), Kuusisaari (Spruce Island), Kivenlahti (Stone Bay) and Leppävaara (Alder Hill).<p><p>“In a sparsely populated country where people earlier mainly moved around by water, it was natural to name places according to their locations on rivers and lakes,” explains Sirkka Paikkala of the Institute for Languages of Finland.<p><p>Finland’s eighth-largest city, with 103,000 inhabitants, is Lahti (Bay). True to its name, Lahti lies on a bay, part of the unimaginatively named Vesijärvi (Water Lake).<p><p>The Helsinki suburb Ruskeasuo is surprisingly green and agreeable, though its name means Brown Bog. Other place-names fit better: Mustikkamaa (Blueberry Land), an island near Helsinki Zoo, is appropriately pleasant; while Helsinki’s bohemian inner-city district Kallio, known for its bar scene, translates aptly as Rock.<p><p>Animals also feature in the names of towns such as Kontiomäki (Bear Hill), Kotka (Eagle) and Nokia. The name of the hometown of the Finnish mobile phone producer derives from an old word for dark-furred martens, whose pelts were valuable.<p><p>“The names of many of our cities were originally the name of a single-family homestead, around which settlements gradually grew into villages and towns,” says Paikkala. Many such names end in the suffix -la, meaning “place,” including Pusula (Kissing Place) and Karhula (Place of the Bear).<p><p>The Finnish place-name of Porvoo, a charming town less than an hour from Helsinki, comes from a corruption of the Swedish-language name Borgå.Photo: VisitFinland<p><p>Several centuries ago, traders from the Swedish region of Hälsingland set up shop by a river mouth on Finland’s south coast. Their settlement became known to local Swedish-speakers as Helsingfors (Helsing Rapids) and later to Finnish-speakers as Helsinki. The capital’s riverside birthplace lies outside the city, in the northern district called Vanhakaupunki (Old Town).<p><p>Paikkala explains that, especially in coastal Finland, many place-names were originally Swedish. Some cities have very different names in the two national languages. Finland’s former capital is known as Turku to Finnish-speakers (from an old Russian word Turgu meaning market place), while to Swedish-speakers it is Åbo (River Settlement).<p><p>Some odd Finnish names arose when tongue-tied Finns mangled older Swedish names. The picturesque old town of Porvoo is one example. Its Swedish name, Borgå, means Fort River, but Finnish-speakers twisted the tricky sounds b, g and å to make their own version. Likewise, the historic island fortress outside Helsinki, Suomenlinna (Finland’s Fortress), was called Viapori before Finland gained independence in 1917 – a Finnish pronunciation of the Swedish-language name, Sveaborg (Sweden’s Fortress).<p><p>The city of Tampere may owe its name to a Swedish word meaning “dam,” or an old Sámi word meaning “calm water between rapids.” Today the indigenous Sámi people mainly make their home in northernmost Lapland, but Sámi place-names survive across the country in areas where they lived earlier. Lapland’s largest town, Rovaniemi, has mixed etymology: rova is Sámi for a wooded hill, while niemi is Finnish for peninsula. Beautiful Nuuksio National Park west of Helsinki owes its name to a Sámi word meaning swan.<p><p>The city of Tampere may owe its name to a Swedish word meaning “dam,” or an old Sámi word meaning “calm water between rapids.”Photo: Jari Mäkinen/VisitFinland<p><p>Several towns and districts have somehow ended up with curious place-names. Visitors should perhaps take good care of their belongings in the eastern town of Varkaus (Theft). Pohja translates to “Bottom.” The railway line running into northwest Lapland ominously ends at a village called Kolari (Crash), though it was more likely named after a tar-burner (koolari) than any disaster.<p><p>Tourists may be impressed by the extent of Helsinki’s tramway network when they notice trams bound for a district called Arabia.<p><p>Finland’s shortest place-name belongs to the village of Ii (that’s the letter i twice, pronounced “ee”), on the Bay of Bothnia. Its name derives from a Sámi word meaning “a place to overnight.” The lovely village of Snappertuna is worth a visit for its name alone, though there is nothing fishy about its obscure Swedish origins.<p><p> <p><p> <p><p> <p><p> <p><p>By Fran Weaver, July 2014<p><p>Bilingual puzzles<p><p>Oddities on the map<p>", "time": "2014-09-12T10:11:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Taste the summer in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/taste-the-summer-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The Finnish summer means spending long days outside, relaxing at the summer cottage and enjoying fresh, seasonal cuisine (recipes below).<p><p>If you ever have the pleasure of being invited to a Finn’s home or cottage in the summertime, you’ll find a great many delights to satisfy your taste buds. A significant part of enjoying summer involves being outdoors, as well as the activity of grilling or barbecuing.<p><p>“In the summertime Finns love their sausages and their new potatoes,” states Virve Räisänen, owner and head chef of Helsinki’s Restaurant Sunn. “Actually, summer officially starts for Finnish cuisine with the arrival of new potatoes.”<p><p>“New potatoes” refers to potatoes harvested early, while still small, considered a special delicacy. Given the Finn’s reputation for being forthright, it comes as no surprise to learn how they enjoy their potatoes. “First you boil them with lots of salt and dill – nothing else,” Räisänen explains. “Then serve them with butter – some people use onion, but butter is the main ingredient.”<p><p>Grilling or barbecuing forms a staple of Finnish summer, when people try to spend as much time outdoors as possible.Photo: SRE<p><p>Finnish summer cuisine includes a range of sausages – and yes, they have been known to cook them on the sauna stove; it’s not unheard of. Fishing is also a popular way to while away the long summer days. Many summer cottage residents prepare the catch of the day in their own smoker, with pikeperch frequently finding its way onto the dining table.<p><p>Meanwhile, the abundance of fresh produce available around the country during the warmer months facilitates all manner of culinary indulgence.<p><p>“Finnish people eat more vegetables in the three months of summer than during the rest of the year,” Räisänen says, laughing. “Fresh peas are very good. We have a summer soup in Finland, which is all about utilising peas and potatoes as the main ingredients.”<p><p>This enthusiasm for fresh local produce also extends to the numerous wild herbs that grow here, which are free for everyone to forage, alongside numerous varieties of berries and mushrooms for which Finland is renowned. Finns pride themselves on being able to make use of much of what nature has to offer. Interestingly, perhaps one of the least likely seasonings is found in the shape of the stinging nettle plant. Harmless and tasty when cooked, it acts as a common summer starter dish, appearing in soups and even pancakes.<p><p>A common summer scenario: It’s a treat to eat outside during the warm months.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>The centrepiece of the Finnish warm season comes in the shape of Midsummer, the longest day of the year, which sets off all manner of celebrations around the country. Giant bonfires are lit alongside lake and ocean shores nationwide as friends and family gather to mark this annual tradition.<p><p>Naturally, food also plays a big role. While Räisänen now spends her Midsummers bringing cottage-style celebrations to the capital region at her restaurant, her childhood memories of the event include one notable treat.<p><p>“Every family has its own traditional recipe of muurinpohjalettu, which is passed down from one generation to the next,” says Räisänen. “These are buckwheat flour pancakes, a Finnish crêpe, prepared in a really rustic way in a big pan over an open fire. The thinner you can get them, with a really crispy edge, the better they are. Fold them in four, and put fresh cream and strawberries on top.”<p><p>Good company, warm weather and good food – all of this and more is on offer during the Finnish summer.<p><p>Still hungry for more? You’ll find other great articles about the Finnish cuisine scene below, after the recipes.<p><p>Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>(serves 4)<p><p>1 kg (2.2 pounds) washed, unpeeled new potatoes (potatoes harvested early) 3 litres (4 1/4 cups) cold tap water 100 g (3.5 ounces) salt Fresh dill<p><p>Wash potatoes well (Virve recommends the potato variety called siikli if you’re in Finland), but leave the peel on. Bring water to boil, making sure it’s salty enough, almost like seawater. Add potatoes and simmer for ten to 15 minutes depending on the size. Always try to use potatoes of about the same size.<p><p>Turn stove off, add fresh dill, put lid on and let potatoes steep for at least ten more minutes. Make sure they’re soft. Drain and serve immediately with salty butter, spring onion and more fresh dill if desired (the perfect accompaniment for every summer dish). Finns especially love these potatoes served with herring, smoked fish and mushroom sauce. You can serve them straight from the pot.<p><p>(serves 4)<p><p>6 tiny summer carrots, washed not peeled 50 g (1.75 ounces) sweet snap peas 50 g (1.75 ounces) sweet peas 1 head of cauliflower 1 onion, including some of the stem 200 g (1/2 pound) tiniest summer potatoes you can find 1.5 litres (6 1/4 cups) whole milk 50 g (1.75 ounces) butter Salt, white pepper Lots of fresh parsley, chopped<p><p>This soup can be made properly only around Midsummer, when all of the vegetables are sweet and fresh, but it is very dear to the Finns and can also be seen on menus throughout spring and summertime. Every house has a recipe of its own, but the key is to use ingredients that are fresh from the garden.<p><p>Wash and chop all the vegetables to spoon size. Add salt, potatoes, carrots and onion to milk and bring to boil. Simmer for about ten minutes. Add butter, cauliflower and peas. Boil for another five minutes. Season with fresh parsley.<p><p>0.5 litre (2 cups) whole milk 2 eggs, beaten Pinch of salt Pinch of sugar 0.5 litre (2 cups) of barley or whole wheat flour 50 g (1.7 ounces) melted butter<p><p>Ideally – and originally – prepared over an open fire in a special cast iron pan, this pancake has crispy edges and is fried so thin that it’s almost transparent.

{"title": "Helsinki hip: Harbours become houses - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/helsinki-hip-harbours-become-houses/", "review": "", "content": "<p> As Helsinki’s population continues to grow, so does the demand for new housing. We take a look at three waterside developments – one recently completed and two still under construction – that have already created room for thousands of new residents in the capital area.<p><p> The newest feats of urban architecture fit well with Helsinki’s continuing legacy following its tenure as World Design Capital in 2012. All three new development areas – Arabianranta, Kalasatama and Jätkäsaari – include fast data services as well as a variety of ownership structures. All of them are situated close the city centre.<p><p>For this artwork in Arabianranta, Anne Siirtola collected bits of ceramics from nearby fields that used to serve as dumping grounds for the Arabia factory.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p> The oldest of these new seashore areas, Arabianranta (Arabia Shore) is located on former wasteland behind the Arabia pottery factory, five kilometres from the city centre, close to a nature reserve. The 8,000 residents live on streets named after renowned designers who once worked at the factory – ceramics production started in 1873.<p><p> The area has now been developed, combining artistic heritage and high-quality design. Locally salvaged pieces of pottery form part of the artworks that decorate the area. A designated path guides pedestrians through the neighbourhood and past the art.<p><p> In the Loppukiri (Final Spurt) cohousing project, 71 somewhat-senior citizens (actually 48 years and above) run a collectively managed block. People have their own apartments but share common food and maintenance services. This modern city innovation is just the type of thing that Helsinki plans to use as a base for its urban future.<p><p>The apartment buildings sprouting up in Jätkäsaari range from modern to futuristic.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p> Design consultancies figure prominently in the city’s plans for the other two seaside developments, as does citizen involvement. The city has made a commitment to incorporating innovation not just in the designed outcome, but also in the whole construction process. Until 2030, Helsinki is remodelling itself within the confines of its own city limits. Both Kalasatama (Fish Harbour) and Jätkäsaari (Dockworker Island) lie within a kilometre of the city centre as the crow flies.<p><p> West Harbour in Jätkäsaari forms a point of entry for ferries and cruise ships. At present, the peninsula of reclaimed land that stretches west from the harbour is a mixture of open brownfield and futuristic construction. By 2030, the former cargo handling site will accommodate an extensive park, more than 17,000 residents and workplaces for 6,000. The area will include private waterside houses, high-density apartments, light traffic connections and a school.<p><p> Kalasatama, too, currently represents a work in progress: cement mixers and florescent-clad labourers. Yet life continues apace for new inhabitants in the first batch of completed buildings.<p><p> A university student named Eeva shows off her two-year-old building’s communal sauna and roof terrace. At the moment, the area is admittedly rather spartan, with only one local shop and constantly evolving paths and roadways.<p><p> While most of Kalasatama is still under construction, the 177-hectare development on reclaimed land just northeast of downtown Helsinki is intended in many ways as a pioneering project. Already the area holds great appeal for young urbanites. New refuse services, communications connections and citizen-sponsored planning highlight the best of modern design.<p><p>Keeping cultural avenues open: Local artists are encouraged to display their painting skills on a wall surrounding the Kalasatama construction area.Photo: Adam Groffman/flickr, cc by-nc-sa 2.0<p><p> With an ultimate total of 20,000 residents, Kalasatama will join the adjacent, increasingly hip neighbourhoods of Kallio and Sörnäinen. Helsinki Planning Department project leader Tuomas Hakila points out that “multiple lines of sight are being created, for example from the dominating Lutheran church in the centre of Kallio down to the water’s edge on the far side of the development.” Parks, recreational facilities and an extensive shopping centre are taking shape around Kalasatama metro station.<p><p> Currently some 2,000 residents enjoy the first fruits of Kalasatama’s planned “smart city.” These include an automated refuse system designed to make collection by truck obsolete. Inevitably, teething pains have been experienced, the access doors being too restrictive for more bulky items.<p><p> However, as Forum Virium project consultant Veera Mustonen says, “There will be a variety of cutting-edge projects in Kalasatama, from cohousing to community interfaces. The area is a test bed for new ideas in urban design, and even in educational methods in the new school.”<p><p> During construction, contractors have left certain areas open for recreational purposes. Two shipping containers on the undeveloped southern shoreline, looking like leftovers from the set of a film by famously understated Finnish film director Aki Kaurismäki, serve during the summer as a popular café, Ihana Kahvila (Wonderful Café). Along with Sompasauna, a simple, self-service sauna next door, the café points the way towards practical but stylish changes yet to come in the Finnish capital.<p><p> <p><p> <p><p> <p><p> By Anthony Shaw, July 2014<p><p> From ceramic to dynamic<p><p> From harbours to houses<p><p> Increasingly smart future<p>", "time": "2014-07-10T11:58:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

With camera in hand, thisisFINLAND visits merchants in Helsinki, Kuopio, Turku, Tampere and Vaasa. See our slideshow below.<p><p>With goods that are made in Finland, market halls attract foreign visitors curious about Finnish specialities and draw local residents looking for quality. The buildings themselves were constructed in the late 1800s and early 1900s.<p><p>In summer 2014, Hakaniemi Market Hall in Helsinki celebrated its 100th anniversary by offering customers coffee and cake. The two floors of the impressive, red brick building are home to nearly 70 shops, from fishmongers to bakeries, from organic vegetables to handmade gifts. Before becoming a market hall, the building, built in 1903, functioned as a horse stable when Finland was a grand duchy under the Russian tsar.<p><p>The Finnish capital boasts two other market halls: Hietalahti Market Hall at the west end of the Boulevard and Old Market Hall beside South Harbour. The latter reopened in summer 2014 after undergoing a year of renovation. Built in 1889, it is the oldest in Finland and is popular among tourists and locals alike, with a large variety of products and a charming atmosphere.<p><p>Helsinki’s Old Market Hall, recently reopened after a year of renovation, attracts crowds of tourists and locals in search of Finnish food and goods.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p>“Most people want Finnish products,” says Elina, who works at the farm stand Sorri in the market hall in the southwestern city of Turku. “That’s why they come to the market hall.” After the long winter, locally grown vegetables replace the imports. Fresh lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and carrots travel only eight kilometres.<p><p>The market hall’s branch of the state-run liquor store Alko sells an organic beer made just 50 kilometres north of town. “We get a lot of demand for organic and regional products,” says Alko salesperson Tinja.<p><p>Market halls also contain restaurants and cafés. Another woman named Elina is sitting in the Sininen Juna (Blue Train) café, part of the Turku-based chain Aschan. She used to live in Saint Petersburg, and says that moving to Turku for her studies was an obvious choice: “The cultural life and the history are the main factors.” The same reasons contributed to her decision to have coffee and chocolate cake in a café that shows off vintage décor from a 1950 railway carriage: “This place is definitely special. Drinking coffee in a train inside a market hall is very nice.”<p><p>This locally made pasta in Tampere Market Hall caters to those who crave gluten-free cuisine.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p>In 2012, 10 percent of the meat and dairy products sold in Finland were organic, and the trend is growing steadily. Tampere Market Hall’s organic restaurant Leo was launched in December 2013. A few stalls away, a bakery sells gluten-free products every Tuesday. Gluten intolerance has doubled in Finland during the past 20 years, so demand is rising.<p><p>Are there still shoes made in Finland? What comes to mind first is to check if the Nokian-brand rubber boots are still manufactured in the little town of Nokia just outside Tampere. “Unfortunately, only the sole is still made in Finland,” says Minna, who works in Kenkä Mikko, the market hall’s shoe shop.<p><p>“But we have other, smaller brands that still make their shoes entirely in Finland.” She holds up footwear made by Sievi (manufactured in the town of the same name, farther north) and Walker’s Friend (made in Vataja, about 100 kilometres west of Tampere).<p><p>The tiny “muikku,” known as vendace in English, can be fried to form a snack or a meal.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p>Finns love fish. Given their annual consumption of 35 kilogrammes per capita, it is no surprise that the market halls include fish stalls. Perch, salmon, pike, whitefish and trout form a few of the species that stare at visitors from trays of ice. “When buying a fish, always check the eyes,” advises Teresa, owner of Kala Patagónico in Hakaniemi Market Hall. “The pupil must be dark and the eye must be clear and shiny.” At the market, fish are always fresh.<p><p>Another Hakaniemi fish seller, Sampo, says that the wild salmon he is holding was still swimming in the archipelago off of Porvoo at 4 am that morning. The eastern Finnish city of Kuopio is known as the capital of the kalakukko, a rye bread filled with fresh vendace, a kind of whitefish. This tasty traditional treat is of course readily available in Kuopio Market Hall.<p><p>The range of shops housed in market halls is not limited to food and clothing. The Kuopio region includes thousands of summer cottages, each with a sauna. Naturally Kuopio Market Hall features a shop dedicated to that favourite Finnish activity. And Tampere’s vendors don’t forget their customers’ dogs: smoked reindeer, pig and cow ears form local delicacies for humankind’s best friend.<p><p>Helsinki’s Old Market Hall, recently reopened after a year of renovation, is located near the Finnish capital’s South Harbour.

Another recovered bottle, a Juglar, fetched 24,000 euros. Read on to find out how the champagne was salvaged – and how it tastes.]<p><p> Åland, a self-governing, Swedish-speaking cluster of islands whose citizens possess Finnish passports, has probably never seen as many journalists simultaneously descend upon it as it did in November 2010.<p><p> That was when local authorities in the capital, Mariehamn, opened two bottles of champagne in front of 105 reporters – but not just any champagne. This stuff had been discovered at the bottom of the ocean the previous summer by divers exploring a sunken ship near one of the islands, and it forms the world’s oldest drinkable champagne.<p><p> Clues help place the age of the wine at almost 200 years: artefacts found onboard; studies of the bottles and corks; and the histories of Juglar and Veuve Clicquot, the champagne houses whose product is contained in the 168 flasks pulled up from the wreck.<p><p> One bottle of each brand was opened for the journalists and a total of 40 portions poured – one of them for thisisFINLAND.<p><p> “It’s been an incredible adventure full of cliffhangers,” says François Hautekeur, oenologist at Veuve Clicquot, founded in 1772. He travelled to Finland to offer expertise in recovering the bottles.<p><p> Hautekeur says he was initially hopeful that the wine would prove to be Clicquot. The first bottles examined, however, came from Juglar, a long-defunct house whose lineage is present in the modern-day Jacquesson brand.<p><p> “We kept working even after discovering that it was Juglar,” Hautekeur says. Months later, the day before the grand tasting event, several bottles were discovered to be Veuve Clicquot. “It was the greatest day of my professional life. I think Madame Clicquot [who ran the company in the early 1800s] gave us a gift.”<p><p> What does Hautekeur say about the champagne itself? “I didn’t think it would be possible to find such aromas in wine that old: many flowers, very dominant, but impossible to guess which ones. As if you entered a forest on another planet, with flowers that don’t exist here. The structure and finish in your mouth are very similar to today.”<p><p>Photo: Lehtíkuva<p><p> The bottom of the Baltic preserves wine better than the finest cellar. As for the future of the bubbly – which actually has very few bubbles left – the locals have big plans.<p><p> An auction or auctions will take place, possibly spinning off into an annual Åland wine and culinary festival. Part of the profits will go to Baltic Sea conservation efforts. “We want to make the most our of our treasure,” says Britt Lundberg, deputy head of the Åland government – and who can blame them for wanting to attract the world to their scenic islands, which already form a cherished tourist destination for Finns and Swedes?<p><p> What price will the champagne fetch? Richard Juhlin, one of the world’s foremost champagne experts, says, “I would be very surprised if it sold for less than 50,000 euros, perhaps significantly more.”<p><p> That’s per bottle.<p><p> In Mariehamn, Juhlin evaluated the golden liquid: “It’s such an intense aroma,” he says. “It’s so different from anything you’ve ever tasted before. When you taste it, it’s so sweet. But beneath that you find a lot more. The Juglar is for me a little bit more rustic, a little bit more powerful, a little bit more of the mushroomy, cheesy aromas – which you find in both.<p><p> And the Clicquot? “One of the strongest notes is linden blossoms – also lime peels, very unexpected white flowers and very beautiful aromas, which make it so exciting.”<p><p> When they served the champagne, you could see sediment floating in the glasses, as if to confirm the authenticity. With a strong, thick, sweet taste, it resembled a dessert wine. It also contained a yeasty flavour reminiscent of homebrewed beer. The words “cask” and “roasted” came to mind.<p><p> It didn’t go to your head at all. The ancient Veuve Clicquot tasted, well, historical. It was everything the experts said, and more – and also less. It hardly resembled what people think of as champagne today, partly because the recipe was different back then, and partly because it has aged for so long.<p><p> It was an experience, like viewing a long-lost masterpiece painting that has resurfaced. Naturally the experts perceive the full nuance, but others can still appreciate it.<p><p> However, next time you’re shopping for champagne, we recommend a modern bottle of Jacquesson or Veuve Clicquot. And as you pop it open, tell your friends how you just saved about 49,950 euros.<p><p> Link:<p><p> The world’s oldest Champagne by Visit Åland<p><p> By Peter Marten, December 2010 and June 2011<p><p> Incredible adventure<p><p> Place your bids<p><p> Let it go to your head<p>", "time": "2014-06-27T08:25:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Yet Finland is the second-“goodest” country on the planet overall, right after Ireland, according to the new Good Country Index, which “tries to measure how much each country on earth contributes to the planet and to the human race”. The index combines 35 different indicators from the UN, the World Bank, the Basel Convention, the Global Footprint Network and other international NGOs and institutions. Finland outpaces its Nordic neighbours Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland, who place sixth, eighth, ninth and seventeenth respectively. Independent policy advisor Simon Anholt authored the study together with scholar Robert Govers. “We live in an age where the impacts of everything we do are always felt around the world, and we need to start taking responsibility for those impacts,” says Anholt. “The Good Country Index is a tool that can help start this process.”<p><p>Finland, a country that is 75 percent forest, ranks number 14 in the Good Country Index’s planet and climate category.Photo: Riitta Supperi/Keksi/Team Finland<p><p>How exactly do they measure “goodness”? The data used for the index fall into seven categories: prosperity and equality (where Finland is number three); science and technology (seven); health and wellbeing (12); world order (12); planet and climate (14); culture (18); and international peace and security (53). The datasets include humanitarian aid contributions; the number of foreign students studying in the country; the number of Nobel Prize winners; and exports of creative goods and services. Negative indicators also exist, and can bring a country’s score down: carbon dioxide emissions and exports of hazardous waste, for example. In order to level the playing field for smaller or poorer nations, most of the Good Country Index indicators are calibrated relative to GDP. “What’s a good country?” asks Anholt. “A country that manages to reconcile good governance at home with a real and constant contribution to the greater good of humanity and the planet.” He sees the index as a catalyst that can help bring issues “to the top of the agenda” without making moral judgements. “It’s time to stop telling our governments we want to live in a successful country,” he says. “We need to demand to live in a good country – one that treats the rest of humanity and the planet with respect.” It’s for the greater good.<p><p> <p><p>By Peter Marten, June 2014<p><p>The good in “goodness”<p>", "time": "2014-06-25T13:30:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

You just haven’t noticed it, even though Lonna is visible from downtown Helsinki and located near the island fortress of Suomenlinna, a popular tourist site. See our slideshow below.<p><p>“We figured that a million people used to pass this island every year without stopping,” says Ville Wäänänen, whose family business, Fregatti Ltd, is in charge of operating Lonna Island and its buildings for the public. Until summer 2014, regular people had no access to the island, although crowds of visitors sailed past Lonna on their way to Suomenlinna. That has changed. Certain ferries to Suomenlinna now also stop at Lonna. The former military island is refurbished and open to the general public. Most of the half-dozen buildings, red brick and red or yellow wood, are now renovated. Continuing improvements are scheduled for the years to come. It takes less than ten minutes to walk the perimeter of the island. When Wäänänen and his colleagues looked at Lonna, “we saw at once that this was something unique,” he says. With a café and a restaurant, as well as plans for a sauna, Lonna is set to attract picnickers, sunbathers and event planners. The island’s unique history includes momentous occasions – it formed the site of negotiations between Swedish and Russian powers in 1808. In the mid- and late 1800s, Lonna housed production and storage facilities for gunpowder and then for mines. It functioned as a centre for mine clean-up in the early 1900s, and switched to demagnetising ships (a process that allowed metal-hulled vessels to avoid setting off mines) during and after the Second World War. Now visitors can bask in the sun at café tables beside a former mine storage building. Meanwhile swans, geese and seabirds nest in the undergrowth and on the shore. The ocean and the fresh air of the archipelago form a key recreation area for the Finnish capital. Lonna offers a new, authentic experience for Helsinkians and visitors alike.<p><p> Certain ferries to the island fortress of Suomenlinna now also serve Lonna Island – before 2014 they used to sail past it without stopping.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p> A seaside picnic takes place against the backdrop of downtown Helsinki.

The consequent environmental problems can only be effectively understood and solved through international cooperation.<p><p>Finland is coordinating the three countries’ jointly declared Gulf of Finland Year 2014 as part of the year-long Finnish presidency of the Council of the Baltic Sea States, which aims to utilise science and technology to make the Baltic Sea “clean, safe and smart”, bringing both economic and environmental benefits.<p><p>The Finnish Environment Institute is leading the tri-national Gulf of Finland Year. “Our main scientific goals are to intensify collaborative monitoring of the state of the sea and facilitate the free exchange of data collected by researchers in Finland, Russia and Estonia,” says project manager Kai Myrberg. “It’s vital to collect data using carefully intercalibrated methods to ensure we get a single, comparable dataset covering the whole gulf.”<p><p>The year’s coordinated research focuses on themes including biodiversity, pollution, fisheries, marine planning and maritime safety, in waters which are among Europe’s busiest for shipping. Many studies will also examine the impacts of climate change and eutrophication problems caused by excessive nutrient levels.<p><p>The Finnish marine research vessel “Aranda” collects data on the Gulf of Finland, including oxygen levels, salinity, sediments and concentrations of pollutants.Photo: Panu Nikkola/Lentokuva Vallas<p><p>During 2014 the Finnish marine research vessel Aranda will be collecting data from more sampling stations in the gulf than ever before, on environmental factors including oxygen levels, salinity, sediments and concentrations of pollutants from excess nutrients to heavy metals. “For the first time we’re also studying noise levels and the amounts of garbage in the sea,” adds Myrberg.<p><p>“This year’s coordinated studies will give us a more complete picture than ever of the state of the gulf,” says Myrberg.

{"title": "Celebrating the Finnish name of the day - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/celebrating-the-finnish-name-of-the-day/", "review": "", "content": "<p> In Finland, people not only celebrate their birthdays each year, but their name days as well. The tradition of assigning names to specific dates stretches back to medieval times.<p><p> Finns are renowned for their efficiency and organisational skills, so perhaps it may not come as a surprise to discover that a combined press run of around 14 million calendars is published in Finland each year. The practice of name days, whereby a name or set of names is assigned to each day in the calendar, has deep roots in Finnish culture. <p><p> “When you look at the Finnish name day calendar, you can see the history of Finland in a nutshell,” explains Minna Saarelma-Paukkala, head of the Almanac Office of Helsinki University, which is responsible for coordinating name days. <p><p> “This custom goes back to the Middle Ages. We also have some names on the calendar from the pre-Christian era, such as Väinö; then we have Catholic names, then Swedish names and some Russian names. Following this we have the Finnish names from the time of our national awakening, and then all kinds of newer names related to recent international influences.”<p><p>Nowadays name days are often celebrated with pastries, like this football-themed cake for Ronja.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p> As the importance of name days changed over the centuries, so did the various traditions associated with it. Finns no longer put a name day tree on the table in the hope of having presents placed under it, nor do they raise a decorated pole in the backyard, yet the tradition still holds special significance for many people.<p><p> “Nowadays, it’s mainly coffee-and-cake celebrations,” Saarelma-Paukkala says. “It is good because some people don’t want to celebrate their birthdays, as growing old is not always so nice for everybody. But they can always celebrate their name day.” <p><p> The Finnish name day calendar presently contains 834 names; the list is updated every fifth year. The main criterion for inclusion is quantity – at least 500 children must have the name. <p><p> The list for 2015 contains a number of new names, yet none are being removed from the calendar. Due to fluctuating popularity over the years, Saarelma-Paukkala explains, many names will eventually return to favour. In addition, certain evergreen names, such as Matti, Juhani, Anna and Maria, continue to enjoy popularity among parents.<p><p>With these towel holders, everyone with a Finnish name can be a star.Photo: Sabrina Salzano<p><p> While some Finns have up to three names, Emma and Onni [the latter means “happiness”] topped the list of first names given to children born in Finland in 2013.<p><p> Meanwhile, the most popular first names among Swedish-speaking Finns that year were Ellen and Emil. (Finland is officially bilingual and 5.5 percent of the population considers Swedish its mother tongue.) In fact, Finland-Swedes also have a name day calendar of their own for celebrating Swedish-language names.<p><p> “Fifty registered Swedish speakers have to share the same name before it is considered for the name day calendar,” explains Leila Mattfolk, who is responsible for the Swedish name day calendar. “They have to be born 1965 or later, which also applies to the Finnish speakers.” <p><p> Finland’s indigenous Sámi people also have their own name day calendar. Furthermore, an Orthodox name day calendar recognises the days of saints that are observed by the 1 percent of the population that is Orthodox Christian.<p><p> Finnish name day celebrations don’t end there: “We Finns also have official name day calendars for cats and dogs,” Mattfolk says. “You can buy them in pet stores. They exist for horses as well.”<p><p> Nameless for two months<p><p> Did you know that Finnish children usually spend the first two months of their lives without an official name? Parents have two months to register their child’s name in the Population Information System, so many choose to wait until well after the child is born before settling on a moniker that fits the new addition to the family. Minna Saarelma-Paukkala of the Almanac Office of Helsinki University points out that this tradition may have to do with people in an earlier era living in isolated parts of the forest and needing sufficient time to make the long trek into town where the child could be christened.<p><p> <p><p> By James O’Sullivan, June 2014<p><p> Checking the calendar<p><p> All kinds of name days<p>", "time": "2014-06-19T06:53:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

It takes place on the Saturday between the 20th and 26th of June. Originally a pagan celebration, it was a tribute to Ukko, the god of thunder. Since he controlled the rain, you had to be nice to him in order to get a good harvest.<p><p>Bonfires were burned on the occasion, a ritual that continues today. However, in the Swedish-speaking areas of Finland – it’s a bilingual country – people have been happy just to put up a well-decorated maypole.<p><p>In the old days, unmarried women would use special charms and bend over a well, naked, in order to see their future husband’s reflection. In another, considerably more modest tradition, one that continues today, a young lady can collect seven different sorts of flowers and place them under her pillow. She will see her future husband in a dream.<p><p>Nowadays, Midsummer is also a celebration of Saint John (hence the Finnish name for the holiday: Juhannus), a time for some people to consume vast quantities of alcohol and a popular weekend for weddings and confirmations.<p><p>Bonfires form an age-old Finnish Midsummer Eve ritual that continues today. Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>My first Midsummer in Finland took place on an island in the middle of the Turku Archipelago in southwestern Finland. It was a weekend of barbequing, swimming, drinking, storytelling, singing and relaxing on the smooth rocks. We were having such a fine time that we didn’t notice the mosquito bites until Monday.<p><p>In Helsinki, I’ve observed several Midsummers on Seurasaari, a forested island with an outdoor museum of historic buildings. Here you find old-fashioned craftsmen, customary games, musicians playing the kantele (the harp-like national instrument), pancakes and burnt sausages. For the finale, they light a huge bonfire and a newlywed couple is rowed around in an old wooden boat. Then I do some folk dancing that I can only fake on Midsummer.<p><p>On another island, I once attended a heavy metal Midsummer, which was fun, but I couldn’t hear anything for the next two days. Additionally, I’ve visited a restaurant with a large, outdoor terrace that features live music and is always absolutely packed. That may be a good thing if you want to bump into your future spouse.<p><p>On the subject of bonfires: At one Midsummer party near Porvoo, 50 kilometres (30 miles) east of Helsinki, we enjoyed a sumptuous buffet and then our host led a caravan of cars. We drove past as many bonfires as we could find. They came in all sizes, and there were a surprising number of them. It was better than bird watching.<p><p>Many Finns spend Midsummer at a waterside cottage where they can swim, relax and visit the sauna. Photo: Anneli Hongisto/Visit Finland<p><p>One year I took a fantastic lake cruise in the central Finnish city of Jyväskylä on a boat covered with so many decorative tree branches that you’d think the whole boat was growing. Onboard, people were grinning so intensely that I’m sure they had sore smile muscles the next day.<p><p>One of my friends has an old farmhouse in central Finland, and I’ve enjoyed a couple of Midsummers there. We don’t do anything special except sit around a campfire, chat and sing along to guitar music. If the visitors get bored, everyone goes skinny dipping.<p><p>Other enjoyable memories come from visiting a couple at their beachside cabin near Varkaus, a town in eastern central Finland. We’d have a grand barbeque and play mölkky, a type of Finnish lawn bowling. We’d take a boat to the restaurant across the water and dance until two, then go to a snack stand in town and chat with the rest of the village population until morning, returning to the couple’s house for a sauna. Usually some new friends would come along with us.<p><p>Overall, I’ve had my share of good Midsummer experiences in Finland. But I’m looking forward to more. Perhaps the best Midsummers are yet to come.<p><p>By Russell Snyder<p><p>My first Midsummer<p><p>And many happy returns of the day<p>", "time": "2014-06-16T07:50:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Salmiakki used to be known mostly as a type of sweet sold in soft or hard drops and lozenges, or as a powder. Lately the magic ingredient has found its way into other sorts of goodies, as a tasty addition to chocolate, ice cream and even barbecue sauce. However, the popularity of traditional salmiakki sweets has not decreased – on the contrary. Helsinki’s Salmiakkikioski, a kiosk specialising in the stuff, forms a good example of salmiakki’s perpetual popularity.<p><p>Erkki Korhonen, who runs the kiosk, says that he wanted to specialise in something in order to make it stand out, and salmiakki represented an easy choice because of its vast fan base in Finland and status as a Finnish speciality for tourists –Finnish and foreign travellers alike. “People from northern Finland have called us and made arrangements to visit our kiosk as part of their Helsinki sightseeing tour,” says Korhonen.<p><p>Many locals have also thanked him for maintaining the vintage kiosk. It’s a lippakioski, a kiosk with a roof that juts out in front, making it look a little bit like a baseball cap (lippa means “visor”). These kiosks date back to the mid-1900s, and fewer than 20 of them survive in Helsinki.<p><p>Korhonen stocks all the best-known brands of salmiakki, and then some. “Many people ask for ‘salmiakki that you can’t get anywhere else’ or want the strongest kind available,” he says.<p><p>Out of the kiosk’s 91 kinds of salmiakki, 31 must be bagged and weighed by hand.Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Just when Korhonen is explaining that many people buy salmiakki to take it abroad, a lady comes in to pick up a present for an upcoming trip to visit relatives in Italy. Many Finns living abroad miss salmiakki. Luckily many online stores sell it nowadays, although their selection is unlikely to be as large as Korhonen’s Salmiakkikioski.<p><p>Many tourists are brought to the kiosk by their Finnish hosts and according to Korhonen they often are amazed by how many types of salmiakki are available: “Many tourists have heard the name ‘salmiakki’ before but have not tasted it before – and when they do, the most common word to describe it seems to be ‘interesting.’” Korhonen’s business partner Pete Neuvonen tells of a group of around twenty Chinese tourists who bought salmiakki and sat down at the tables to taste it – about half of them spat it out, while the other half became instant salmiakki converts. Korhonen adds that many Finns serve salmiakki to their unsuspecting foreign friends just to see what will happen.<p><p>Neuvonen prefers his salmiakki straight, but knows various ways salmiakki can be mixed. “People put salmiakki powder in espresso coffee, yoghurt and all sorts of pastries – and we’ve even heard of someone making salmiakki-strawberry jam.” However you use it, and whether you love it or hate it, salmiakki offers an unforgettable taste.<p><p>By Kasperi Teittinen, August 2013<p><p>Vintage kiosk for a vintage taste<p><p>Popular present and special ingredient<p>", "time": "2014-06-09T11:35:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

We talk to the video’s creator.<p><p><p><p>The video, entitled My Helsinki, begins unremarkably enough. It seems to show the point of view of someone walking along a scenic path overhung with leafy tree branches. But when you emerge from the forest, something extraordinary happens: suddenly you begin to ascend, going higher and higher, until you are soaring in the bright sunshine over Helsinki.<p><p>In an era when images are ubiquitous in social media, Lare Lekman has created an entirely new way of looking at the Finnish capital by using a small, camera-equipped quadcoptor.<p><p>“I filmed for about six months, from May to November 2013, including dozens of flights.” Lekman says. “I started filming underwater videos about ten years ago. Gradually, I crawled onto land and then flew into the sky. Air is very similar to water in filming, as they both offer three dimensions.”<p><p>The video takes the viewer on an aerial tour of the city, from the downtown streets at night to a packed football game in Olympic Stadium, from cruise ships docked in the harbour to swans calmly swimming along the rocky shore. It shows the Finnish capital’s urbanity while also emphasising Helsinki’s surprising proximity to wild forests and the open ocean.<p><p>“Perhaps I most enjoyed my flights in Lauttasaari [an island just west of Helsinki] and by the Helsinki Cathedral,” he continues. “Torni [a hotel with a bar located at the top of a tower] was also nice, as people on the roof terrace were waving at my quadcopter.”<p><p>All of these landmarks are familiar to anyone who has visited Helsinki, but until now no one has been able to gracefully and effortlessly float up above the Ursa Observatory in Kaivopuisto, the seaside park at the southern end of the city. Lekman says he chose his subjects by simply looking out his window and thinking about what locations worked best at a particular time of the day and year.<p><p>Lare Lekman poses with the camera-carrying quadcopter that allows him to film bird’s-eye views of the Finnish capital.Photo: Lekman Consulting<p><p>“My quadcopter, a DJI Phantom, always flew consistently and reliably,” Lekman says. “To make sure it does, there are several things you should do, such as updating the quadcopter firmware, checking the flight unit calibration and handling the copter well. It’s all pretty simple once you get the hang of it.<p><p>“Modern multicopters are quite easy to fly compared to traditional radio-controlled helicopters. However, it does take some practice to handle the copter well, especially when flying towards yourself, taking off and landing.”<p><p>Lekman owns his own consulting company where he helps his clients in software development. In his spare time he combines his love of technology with outdoor activities.<p><p>“During my leisure time I enjoy diving, video productions, various sports and lately kiteboarding,” he says.<p><p>In fact, he might combine his skills in diving, videography and remote-controlled vehicles in the future for a new project.<p><p>“I was recently asked to work as an advisor in a Tampere University research project to build a submersible robot for studying underwater caves and wrecks,” Lekman says. “I would love to participate, so hopefully they will get the funding.”<p><p>By David J.

Helsinki now offers more Michelin-starred restaurants than ever, despite the exit of the capital’s most renowned fine dining establishment.<p><p>In early 2014 two more Helsinki restaurants gained Michelin-star recognition: Chef &amp; Sommelier and Ask. They join Demo, Luomo, Olo and Postres, bringing the total to an all-time high of six.<p><p>The country’s most famous Michelin-starred restaurant during the noughties was Chez Dominique. Serving Finnish-French cuisine, it received its first star in 2001, and earned a second in 2003. It held on to both stars until closing its doors, despite its fame, in 2013.<p><p>Its success gave rise to a true trickledown effect in the local industry, with Chez Dominique employees soaking up knowledge and experience while working there and incorporating that expertise into their own endeavours later.<p><p>Filip Langhoff is co-owner and head chef of the Michelin-starred Ask in the Helsinki neighbourhood of Kruununhaka.Photo: Linda Stenman-Langhoff<p><p>“Chez Dominique was like a little college,” explains Jouni Toivanen, owner and chef of the Michelin-starred Luomo. “So many chefs from there have since opened their own restaurants.”<p><p>Offering local cuisine with a hint of international flavours and techniques, Luomo is situated next to Market Square in the heart of the city. The restaurant opened in 2009, with the idea of serving only one menu, for all people at a reasonable price. The people duly responded, and Luomo was awarded a Michelin star nine months later.<p><p>“You’re not after it, but it’s a reward,” Toivanen says. “It has not affected the way I run the restaurant. We have changed a little bit over the past five years: now we have à la carte and serve mainly Finnish food.”<p><p>Luomo forms one of six Michelin-starred restaurants in Finland – all located in the capital city.<p><p>“They are all small and privately owned,” says Filip Langhoff, co-owner and head chef of Ask, which recently joined the elite list. The other newcomer is Chef &amp; Sommelier, on the other side of town. “All have a really strong chef, either as a co-owner or working actively in the restaurant.”<p><p>Vegetable crisps serve as hors-d’oeuvres and sculpture at Ask.Photo: Linda Stenman-Langhoff<p><p>An intimately small establishment serving Nordic cuisine in the Kruununhaka neighbourhood, Ask quickly gained favour after opening its doors in 2012.<p><p>“The restaurant follows our own philosophy by using only organic food – like we do at home,” Langhoff says. “We don’t want to serve our guests something we wouldn’t eat ourselves. If guests leave here feeling they have had dinner in our living room, then we have succeeded.”<p><p>Unsurprisingly, Langhoff and his wife Linda also used to work at Chez Dominique. “The local scene here is evolving really fast,” Langhoff says. “From high-end restaurants to an interesting street food segment, Helsinki is starting to have a broad food scene. There is a good variety, which is great for a city this size.”<p><p>Meanwhile, you might ask, what’s going on in the building that Chez Dominique used to occupy?

{"title": "How the heck do you learn Finnish? part 2 - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/how-the-heck-do-you-learn-finnish-part-2/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Learning Finnish – it can be done. Just ask one of the ever-growing number of non-Finns who have gained proficiency in the language. An outgoing, positive attitude helps, and so does a good textbook.<p><p>In part two of what has become an enormously popular article (see part one), we talk to more friends and colleagues to find out what textbooks they like and what tried-and-true tips they recommend for mastering Finnish.<p><p>If you’re looking to speak Finnish, you’ve arrived in the right place.Photo: flickr/StillBurning, cc by nc 2.0<p><p>Marina from Italy: Suomen kielen alkeisoppikirja (Finnish language: A basic textbook) and its companion books, by Anna-Liisa Lepäsmaa and Leena Silfverberg (Finn Lectura) are, in my opinion, the most complete and systematic. I like the fact that they’re written only in Finnish. I think that’s the best system – that way you learn from context and begin to think in Finnish. I like the practical approach of Finnish for Foreigners with its dialogues and its vocabulary section. I found the dialogues on the CDs very useful. Kato hei – puhekielen alkeet (Look: Beginning colloquial Finnish) by Maarit Berg and Leena Silfverberg (Finn Lectura) and the accompanying CD are very useful for learning the basics of colloquial (informal or spoken) Finnish. It’s very useful to learn how to write correctly in Finnish. A thin book made especially for non-Finns can serve as a reference: Tarkista tästä (Check it here) by Hannele Jönsson-Korhola and Leila White (Finn Lectura).<p><p>Marina’s tips: It’s important to start by learning Finnish grammar, but don’t focus on that alone. Read Finnish and listen to people speaking Finnish or, if you don’t live in Finland, use CDs or the internet. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes when you speak, and when you’re in Finland try to speak as much Finnish as possible!<p><p>“Kipinä” (Spark), a textbook series for Finnish high school kids, offers students of Finnish the chance to challenge themselves and expand their horizons.Photo: thisisFINLAND<p><p>Nicola from Italy: Hyvin menee (Doing well) by Satu Heikkilä and Pirkka Majakangas (Otava) contains the basics and describes situations that you may find useful in Finland: the market, the seasons or the doctor’s office. Following short dialogues or texts, the book analyses and reviews the grammar and offers exercises. Because it is only in Finnish, I recommend taking a course at the same time. Kipinä 1–2 – suomea lukioon (Spark 1–2: High-school Finnish) by Niina Eloranta and Heidi Lehtosaari (Otava) is a new and very interesting book, so you can even discuss it with colleagues on your coffee break. Grammar is presented by means of current topics such as immigration, music, design, sauna and many others. In order to make the most of this advanced-level book (it is actually a Finnish textbook for Finnish-speaking high-school students), you should already know the basic rules, cases and vocabulary.<p><p>Nicola’s tips: In my experience, learning Finnish is a process that takes some years, maybe just a couple if you are very motivated. How do you speed up this process? Of course you need to learn the basics during your initial phase. Other than that, speak and listen. Try to talk as much as you can. Movies and news are a great help. Finns appreciate it when somebody tries to speak their language, no matter how many mistakes you might make. In the end you’ll find out that it’s about not only learning a language, but discovering a culture and a way people think.<p><p>Spoonful of sugar: The red one or the blue one? Blue and white are the colours of Finland, of course.Photo: flickr/frech, cc by sa 2.0<p><p>Matthieu from France: Kieli käyttöön (Putting language to use) by Marjukka Kenttälä (Gaudeamus) is a Finnish textbook in Finnish. That’s the best way to immerse yourself in the Finnish language. You may need to ask a Finnish person for help, but only in the beginning. Each lesson offers clear explanations and the vocabulary can be used directly in conversation. After finishing the first book, you’re already able to accomplish small conversations. A Grammar Book of Finnish by Leila White (Finn Lectura) forms a good addition to improve individual grammar points.<p><p>Matthieu’s tips: Don’t be afraid to speak Finnish, and continue to speak it even if people start to speak English to ease the conversation. As Finnish words are really different from other languages, learn them by heart and repeat them again and again.<p><p>“Start to Finnish” contains useful dialogues and some handy colloquial words.Photo: thisisFINLAND<p><p>Anke from Germany: I learned Finnish with the book Yksi, kaksi, kolme: Finnisch für Deutschsprachige (One, two, three: Finnish for German speakers) by Senja Riekkinen-Gebbert (Hempen). You can learn the language with this book, but I found that it uses a more formal language than regular people in Finland. Later I used From Start to Finnish by Leila White (Finn Lectura) and I really liked it. The dialogues in the book are useful for the first conversations in a new country. It also contains some colloquial words, which comes in handy.<p><p>Anke’s tips: In my opinion it’s hard to learn Finnish, but not just because of all the double letters in the written language. It’s more about practicing. If you start speaking Finnish with a Finn, they may recognise that you’re not Finnish and, since they’re friendly people, they switch to English. But use your Finnish and don’t get discouraged!

I considered dropping it completely several times, but since I really wanted to come to Finland, my motivation level was very high and I continued. Now I can speak almost fluently, and I can’t even explain how great it feels to watch movies without subtitles, to speak Finnish when I go to the bank and to talk about everything with my friends.

I bought it at a flea market because I loved the illustrations. Then I found that the text is very useful in everyday life. My other favourite is Leonardon suuri unelma (Leonardo’s Dream) by Hans de Beer (Lasten keskus). The text consists of simple, useful words. The dialogues are simple but emotional, which helps teach you different ways to say things. The penguin in the book doesn’t just talk about the weather – he says stuff like “Eipä taida olla tänään lentosää” (It doesn’t seem to be flying weather today), so you learn something new.<p><p>The title “Suomen mestari” suggests that you’re on your way to becoming a master, or champion, of the Finnish language.Photo: thisisFINLAND<p><p>Florian from Germany: The Suomen mestari (Finnish champion) series forms an all-Finnish study book for people who are learning Finnish from scratch, and for people who know some Finnish and want to improve.

If you answer the door on the Sunday before Easter, you may be confronted by endearing little witches offering to bless your home in return for treats.<p><p>In the most popular family tradition, young children (especially girls) dress up as Easter witches, donning colourful old clothes and painting freckles on their faces. “The little witches then go from door to door, bringing willow twigs decorated with colourful feathers and crepe paper as blessings to drive away evil spirits, in return for treats,” says children’s culture expert Reeli Karimäki of the Pessi Children’s Art Centre in Vantaa, just north of Helsinki.<p><p>Like many Finnish householders, Karimäki keeps a basket of small chocolate Easter eggs ready by the door to pay off the marauding witches.

Reindeer owners trot with their animals on the lake before the race to warm them up, then coax them into starting gates.<p><p>Clad in streamlined ski suits and helmets, the jockeys stand on skis behind the reindeer. These reindeer have actual reins, and the jockeys hold on tight to keep the animals from veering off course. High-speed falls are not unusual. At the finish line they let go of the reins, allowing the exhausted reindeer to rejoin the others in a paddock.<p><p>Side events include lasso-throwing contests and 220-metre reindeer sprint races. Beside the racecourse, locals gather to gossip at stalls selling tools, furs, hot coffee and tasty reindeer meat stew.<p><p>Ollila explains that, most importantly, the races give reindeer-herding folk from around this vast, sparsely populated region a chance to get together socially. “There isn’t any official betting on the races, but I can’t say what goes on in the bars,” she says. Inari’s two bars certainly do a roaring trade during the event, and lively debate arises about the merits of the four-legged, two-antlered athletes.<p><p>Many of the reindeer owners are indigenous Sámi people, and some competitors come over the border from Norway.<p><p>Ari Niittyvuopio gives his reindeer, Dat Lea, a pep talk in the paddock before the race.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>At the races I meet Ari Niittyvuopio from Karigasniemi, who owns two-time champion reindeer Dat Lea (the name means “That’s it!” in Sámi). I ask him what makes a good racing reindeer. “The reindeer we use in races are five-to-ten-year-old males,” he explains. “When we watch our reindeer on the mountains, we notice which ones look big and muscular. I think the darker reindeer are tougher, and a good racing reindeer should also be just a bit crazy!”<p><p>Dressed in colourful, traditional Sámi costumes, sisters Elen Anne Sara and Magreta Sara have come from their remote farmstead home to participate in the women’s lassoing competition – and to cheer on one of the family’s reindeer, Isomus, in the big race.<p><p>“I shouldn’t have worn my costume, because it cramped my lassoing style,” says Elen Anne with a smile.

Her father worked as a diplomat, and the family followed him to Moscow. During the unrest in Afghanistan in 1992, the family came to Finland as refugees. In Finland, Razmyar has pursued her dreams with great determination.<p><p>Razmyar started school in Finland at the age of eight. She was nervous about the first day. In Finland, children are entitled to lessons in their native language. Razmyar did not know any Finnish, and she was afraid that no one would play with her. Her fear turned out to be unfounded: she made new friends immediately. No words were needed – children can communicate in many other ways.<p><p>Razmyar had always admired her father, and she dreamed about a job in politics. Instead of party games, her father used to organise news quizzes for the children. She and her little brother learned to keep up with international politics. They were interested in events in Afghanistan and Finland, their new home country.<p><p>Outside a Helsinki shopping centre, Nasima Razmyar chats with people during the parliamentary election campaign of 2011.Photo: Sari Gustafsson/Lehtikuva<p><p>Active and outgoing by nature, Razmyar engaged in peer support and student association activities while at school.

In the same year, she was elected as a city councillor in Helsinki.

Over 20 million books are sold in Finland every year. That’s an average of four books per person, including children.<p><p>In Finland as elsewhere, readers are clearly divided into major consumers and others. Approximately one in every six Finns between the ages of 15 and 79 buys at least ten books per year. Together, these major consumers buy over half of all books sold. Overall, book buying is quite common: three out of four Finns buy at least one book per year.<p><p>Even since the advent of the internet, the Finns continue to be drawn to books. “Browsing” can still mean looking at books at the library rather than online browsing.Photo: Viena Kytöjoki / Lehtikuva<p><p>The internet does not seem to have affected the popularity of books to any great extent. For example, in 1995 – before widespread use of the internet – far fewer books were purchased in Finland than today. So the popularity of books has grown in spite of the rise in electronic media. And book sales have grown even faster in terms of value than they have in volume – readers have been willing to pay more for their books.<p><p>Finnish fiction remains the most popular genre in Finland, although translated fiction still accounts for a solid share of sales despite having seen a slight fall. Approximately one in every three Finns has read Finnish fiction during the past month. Finns also read books on history and home economics (mainly cookery books), and memoirs, crime novels and children’s books. They are increasingly reading foreign fiction in languages other than Finnish.<p><p>Books have long formed a traditional gift in Finland. In this respect, the scene is changing, as people are more frequently buying books to read themselves. About half of the books purchased as gifts are given to family members – and will perhaps be read by the gift-giver, as well.<p><p>On average, each Finn borrows more than a dozen books from the library every year. Shown here is another of Finland’s mobile libraries.Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa / Lehtikuva<p><p>Finland is full of libraries – there is at least one in every municipality. Finland’s 300 plus central libraries are supported by 500 branch libraries and, particularly in sparsely populated areas, also mobile libraries, in the form of specially outfitted buses. Mobile libraries account for just under ten percent of all loans. Finland even has a library boat. A reservation system allows mobile libraries to offer the same books as central libraries.<p><p>The modern mobile library carries a selection of over 4,000 titles, including not only books but also a range of magazines, newspapers and audiovisual materials. Mobile library routes comprise dozens of stops. Even in a relatively densely populated region such as southern Finland, a mobile library may clock up 50,000 kilometres annually – in the north, the distances are greater.<p><p>By European standards, Finland’s public library services are technologically advanced as well as substantial in terms of volume. Libraries are free to use, although small fees are charged for late returns.<p><p>Finland’s library services are quite popular and actively used – about 40 percent of citizens are active users and visit the library about twice a month. On average, Finns borrow a book from a public lending library more than once a month. Or, looking at it from another perspective, libraries contain just over seven books per Finn and each book is read an average of 2.5 times per year.<p><p>Libraries are also significant book buyers. Every year they spend well over 300 euros per citizen on the acquisition of books and other materials. Libraries also benefit writers: authors and translators can apply for library grants to fund their writing. These grants are also awarded to authors who are unable to work due to age or illness.<p><p>Although books account for a considerable proportion of public libraries’ collections, plenty more is on offer: magazines, newspapers and audiovisual materials.<p><p>By Matti Sovijärvi, March 2014<p><p>Land of libraries<p><p>Library network in Finland<p>", "time": "2014-04-28T08:11:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Many ski resorts offer a long training season and great facilities for snowboarders. Successful athletes are also doing their part to boost the snowboarding craze. Finland is home to many snowboarding world champions, and recent Olympics have seen Finnish medalists in the men’s half-pipe event (Markku Koski took bronze in 2006 and Peetu Piiroinen won silver in 2010).<p><p>However, top-class snowboarding in Finland is not dominated by men. One of the brightest stars of the current team is Enni Rukajärvi, a 23-year-old from the northeastern Finnish town of Kuusamo.

It’s also possible to practise jumping from water ramps, although that’s more useful for skiers and not as practical for snowboarders.”<p><p>She adds that a lot of preparation can be done in the gym during the off-season so that every muscle is ready for the strain of the competition season.<p><p>When she’s not on the hill, Rukajärvi says that she spends “too much time” on her computer, watching videos and keeping in touch with friends.

She is not entirely happy with women’s position in snowboarding: “There is a growing interest in women’s snowboarding, but it’s still men who grab most of the attention.”<p><p>Since snowboarding is often considered an extreme sport, you might think that all snowboarders are completely fearless. However, this is not the case for Rukajärvi. “Going for a big jump for the first time or performing in bad weather conditions is sometimes a bit scary,” she says.<p><p>Asked if she has any routines when preparing for a descent, she responds, “At the top of the hill, I always tighten the straps just before hitting the slope.”<p><p> <p><p>By Kasperi Teittinen, December 2013<p><p>Finland has room for snowboarders<p><p>Women’s snowboarding needs more attention<p>", "time": "2014-02-11T11:58:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

We visit Helsinki’s first Sámi daycare and also look at how Sámi-language TV programming is expanding.<p><p>The Sámi homeland stretches across northern Finland, Sweden and Norway and a corner of Russia. Today many Finnish citizens with Sámi roots live in other parts of Finland. A new kindergarten called Máttabiegga Giellabeassi (South Wind Language Nest) recently opened in the Deep South – that is to say, Helsinki – where young children can now be immersed in the Sámi language.<p><p>“We joke that Helsinki is the biggest Sámi village in Finland, since about 1,000 Sámi live in the Helsinki area, having come here to work or study,” says Ida-Maria Helander, one of two kindergarten teachers at Máttabieggam, which opened at the end of 2013. “People are very pleased with this new opportunity for their children to learn their ancestral language – and they’ve also been impressed by the nice furnishings and materials we have here.”<p><p>Máttabiegga is built on a model for the revivalist teaching of minority indigenous languages called a “language nest,” first devised in New Zealand for children of families with Maori roots. “We speak only Sámi to the kids, playing games, singing songs and teaching them new words, though they may answer in Finnish or Sámi as they prefer,” explains Sivi Jomppanen, Máttabiegga’s other teacher.<p><p>“We try to teach them about Sámi culture too. In Sámi families children are expected to join in more often in what the adults are doing, and our kids help us a lot with things like baking and tidying up toys.”<p><p>Kindergarten teachers Ida-Maria Helander (left) and Sivi Jomppanen speak only Sámi with the kids.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Máttabiegga is housed in a comfortable converted apartment. At the time of our visit in January 2014, it already provides daycare and language immersion to four children between the ages of one and four. Helander and Jomppanen expect all of the kindergarten’s eight full-day places and two half-day slots to be filled by the end of 2014. When accepting new children, the daycare aims to prioritise kids who have Sámi family ties.<p><p>The language nest was established using funds from the Finnish Cultural Foundation and is run with funding from the Ministry of Education channelled through Finland’s Sámi Parliament and the City-Sámit organisation, which brings together Sámi living in the Helsinki area.<p><p>“We’re excited about the future, since Máttabiegga has been such a success,” says Helander. “We hope similar Sámi-language nests will soon be set up in other cities like Rovaniemi and Oulu.”<p><p>Two-year-old Áile seems happy in her Sámi surroundings, pointing at pictures of animals and telling us their names in Sámi: bussá (cat), beana (dog) and boazu (reindeer).

It covers issues affecting Sámi in Finland and complements the existing 15-minute weekday evening Sámi-language news broadcasts produced jointly by public service broadcasters from Norway, Sweden and Finland.<p><p>The 2013 Sámi Language Achievement Award was subsequently granted to Yle Sápmi by the Sámi Language Council. “We’re very pleased that our own community has recognised our efforts to renew and expand our programming and make our own TV news,” says Pirita Näkkäläjärvi, head of Yle Sápmi.<p><p>The family of Sámi languages once included ten distinct variants, of which at least six still survive. Yle Sápmi additionally broadcasts about eight hours of radio programming each weekday – mainly in the most widely spoken Northern Sámi language, but with items increasingly also produced in the minority Inari Sámi and Skolt Sámi languages, which are also spoken in Finland but have just 300–400 speakers each. The Skolt Sámi cultural association Saa’mi Nue’tt consequently named Yle Sápmi the 2013 Skolt Sámi of the Year.<p><p>Näkkäläjärvi explains that by promoting these minority-within-a-minority languages, Yle Sápmi aims to break down barriers by helping speakers of Finland’s different Sámi languages to understand each other better, rather than having to communicate using Finnish.<p><p>“We’re also hoping to expand our programming for children,” says Näkkäläjärvi. “We have a fine new studio for the popular children’s TV programme Unna Junná – broadcast nationwide on Yle Channel Five – which has played a vital role by making Sámi children more visible.

{"title": "Finnish ecovillage runs on future energy - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-ecovillage-runs-on-future-energy/", "review": "", "content": "<p>An innovative ten-house ecovillage in Kempele, northern Finland, self-sufficiently produces its own electricity with no connection to the national power grid.<p><p> Timo Korva, a Finn in his thirties, is a man with high standards. When he decided to build his own house all by himself in 2010, he knew what he wanted. “It had to look the way I imagined it, while saving as much energy as possible,” says the father of two, standing in his well-kept yard. “Sometimes this can be an issue, because building an ecological house can involve a lot of regulations. But in Kempele, that wasn’t the case. The rules were very easy to follow, and there weren’t many of them.” Nine other families also decided to build their houses in Kempele, a town located only 15 kilometres from the northern Finnish city of Oulu, in a neighbourhood established in 2010. In their quest for energy efficiency, they became the European pioneers of a unique experiment: saving energy while living off-grid, disconnected from the general electric network. <p><p>As Finland’s forestry industry processes timber, the by-product wood chips can be used by power plants such as the one in Kempele’s ecovillage.Photo: Tuomas Marttila/Lehtikuva<p><p> “So this is how it works,” says managing director Jarno Haapakoski of Volter, the company that built the small power plant that provides the village with energy. The enthusiastic engineer proudly shows off the facility at the edge of the neighbourhood. “We buy woodchips, which are easily available here in Finland, thanks to the forest industry.” The power plant first converts the wood chips to wood gas, which is then burned to provide electricity. The thermal energy produced by the generator is used to heat water, which warms the houses as it passes through pipes in the floors. The energy created suffices to provide the ten houses with heat and electricity all year round. A windmill stands ready to supply extra power in case the power plant falls short. The ecovillage concept represents a remarkable achievement in an area where winter temperatures can reach minus 40 degrees. According to Korva, living off-grid benefits the community and has no drawbacks. “I had rules to follow, but they were easy to comply with,” he says. “For instance, I installed special kinds of light bulbs and had to buy thicker windows, but I would most probably have done that anyway. And more importantly, I’ve saved money while still living in a comfortable house.” To avoid wasting energy, the ecovillage inhabitants had to change the way the sauna worked, since it can consume a great deal of electricity. “We had to install a wood-burning sauna stove instead of an electric one,” explains Korva. “But that’s OK, because the wood stove is of better quality.” <p><p>In this Kempele neighbourhood, shown when houses were still under construction, everyone takes part in energy decisions. The power plant is the red and grey building to the left of the playing fields.Photo: Volter<p><p> If the starting price for this kind of a power plant is 150,000 euros, it quickly becomes profitable, especially when people decide to pool their resources and rent one. “The village created a cooperative,” says Haapakoski. “This is the first unit we installed, so we had a special arrangement: They rent the power plant from us, we take care of it, and after two years they decide whether to continue with it. I don’t see any reason why they wouldn’t.” Volter has already sold five other units in Finland. “I feel like this common goal of saving energy created a sense of unity among the inhabitants of this village,” Haapakoski says. To strengthen the sense of community, Volter built a small playground between the houses and the company’s office. A few curious kids, playing outside in a sunny afternoon, run to meet the visitors. They wonder why somebody came from far away to visit their houses. “Our main office is just next door, as this was the first project we had,” says Haapakoski. “The inhabitants can come to talk to us, to complain or to ask questions about the plant. But they don’t come so often, because things are working well.” <p><p>By Pauline Curtet, January 2014<p><p>Powerful advantages<p><p>Energy-saving sense of unity<p>", "time": "2014-01-31T11:01:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

They’re also making physical activity accessible for people of all ages, regardless of possible disabilities.<p><p> Finland is known as a top contender in various sports, but non-competitive exercise to improve general wellbeing is also recognised as important. The effects of exercise and a healthy lifestyle have been widely studied, and the Finnish public sector takes this into consideration.<p><p>Don’t feel like skiing? How about trying snowshoes? Minna Lainio-Peltola helps get more people in Turku interested in exercise.Photo: Julia Koivulanaho<p><p> A recent publication by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health suggests that in addition to increasing physical activity, the converse is also true: you should avoid sitting for long periods in your everyday routine. The public sector, especially the municipalities, have a significant mission in arranging possibilities for a healthier life and encouraging people to exercise in a way that suits them best.<p><p> Minna Lainio-Peltola, head of the physical activities unit in the southwestern Finnish city of Turku, says that municipal sports services play an important role in national health work:<p><p> “Sports clubs and businesses focus mostly on those who are already active in sports, so it is the duty of the municipalities to promote and improve facilities for those who are less active.” While the municipalities previously simply maintained sports facilities, they now they offer planned activities for everyone from small children to the elderly.<p><p>Trailside exercise machines inspire joggers and walkers to try their hand.Photo: Julia Koivulanaho<p><p> Turku sports services collaborate with kindergartens and schools, aiming to include as much exercise as possible, even during school holidays.<p><p> Lainio-Peltola says that the needs of families are taken into account: “For instance, we have a very popular indoor sport playground event called Sports Wonderland for Kids, which is held in several suburbs with large numbers of families.”<p><p> Information about sports services in Turku appears in a magazine published three times a year, but according to Lainio-Peltola, the most effective way of informing is via other city organisations:<p><p> “Besides schools and kindergartens, social and health services are a good way to reach people. Local health centres even held a contest to see who could get the most people to join our sports groups” says Lainio-Peltola. Positive feedback has been expressed, not only by the participants but also by the instructors, who are happy to be teaching motivated beginners.<p><p> The practical results of getting active have also been studied in Turku: whereas in 1993 only 31 percent of the city’s adult population were sufficiently physically active, by 2010 the number had increased to 47 percent.<p><p>Range of options: You’ve played soccer and volleyball, but have you tried frisbee golf?Photo: Julia Koivulanaho<p><p> Municipal facilities give everyone in Finland a chance to exercise, says Lainio-Peltola: “There are jogging and hiking paths everywhere, not to mention swim centres.”<p><p> Cities and municipalities collaborate to improve the services, share new ideas and discuss best practices – Turku is in contact with Oulu, a northern city, and Heinola, a town in central southern Finland.<p><p> Neighbouring municipalities and dedicated organisations also work together to provide opportunities for applied exercise – programmes for people with disabilities, long-term illnesses or other limitations.<p><p> “This is very important so that everyone can enjoy sports, especially children who have disabilities,” says Lainio-Peltola. She is also pleased with the improved offerings for senior citizens in Turku: “Previously we had many fit seniors in our service groups. Now sports organisations have arranged their own groups for them and our services can be dedicated to those with weaker abilities.”<p><p> <p><p> By Kasperi Teittinen, January 2014<p><p> More people in better shape<p><p> Intercity cooperation<p>", "time": "2014-01-23T10:56:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

But beware! Every sport has its hazards. So here’s some advice – and some things to look out for:<p><p>Falling is part of the fun: You’re going to fall, but just go with the flow. It’s only snow.Photo: Tero Sivula/Lehtikuva<p><p>I remember skiing on a clear, sunny day. The trail was well marked, and there were a lot of people around. Suddenly, it clouded up and began snowing. When the snow became heavy, I could no longer see any people or trail markings. I was lost in the forest and started to panic. Would I survive? Should I build a snow shelter? Then I saw someone.<p><p>“Can you help me out of this wilderness?” I asked.<p><p>“Certainly,” he said. “Just continue in this direction for a few hundred metres and you’ll see the main road.”<p><p>How embarrassing! I got “lost” in the suburbs of Helsinki. When in doubt, bring a map or a smartphone along.<p><p>He acts like the ski tracks are a motorway. He goes as fast as he can, sees nothing, stops for nobody and will run over you going downhill, uphill or on level ground. He has the facial expression of someone being chased by a big bear. But later, in the après-ski sauna, this madman changes his personality completely. He talks about how relaxing skiing is, about the beauty of the countryside, and about being at peace with nature. Watch out, though! Back on the tracks, he’ll become crazy again. Fortunately, most Finns are polite skiers.<p><p>When you’re whizzing along downhill, you’re sure to meet up with a sharp curve. And often in the middle of the curve, the outside track turns off at a 90-degree angle, and the inside track continues straight ahead (due to people pushing off to gain more speed). This results in you doing a spectacular gymnastic move and ending up in a headstand in the snow with your skis sticking straight up. Thank goodness for soft snow. Eventually, you’ll get the hang of it.<p><p>All ages: Cross-country skiing offers a good way to get out and enjoy the fresh air with your family.Photo: Tero Sivula/Lehtikuva<p><p>I always wondered why skiers carried around all those different waxes. Wax is wax, I figured. No need to show off, so I only bought one kind. Later, I was happily skiing on a cold, crisp day, when the weather warmed up. Then I noticed that the scenery was the same as it was 20 minutes ago. My skis were moving, but I wasn’t. I ended up carrying my skis all the way back, while those “wax experts” glided merrily by. Always bring along an assortment of waxes. (Nowadays you can also get waxless skis, which are generally adequate for hobby-level skiers.)<p><p>Feeling in top form one morning, I skied ten kilometres like I had wings on my ankles. While taking a break, my stomach started telling me to eat something. At a café, I noticed a sign that said, “Today’s Lunch Special.” The next thing I knew, I had just finished a schnitzel, French fries, vegetables, salad, bread, butter, milk and dessert. When I got back on my skis, that delicious food turned to lead in my stomach. And the ten-kilometre return trip felt like 100. Eat light on the trail.<p><p>Don’t think about work problems, relationship difficulties, politics or the threat of world destruction while out on the tracks. Cross-country skiing is a wonderful sport. Enjoy it in a good mood.<p><p> <p><p>By Russell Snyder, December 2013<p><p>Know where you’re going<p><p>The frustrated racer<p><p>Deadly curves<p><p>Waxes are useful<p><p>Ignore your stomach<p><p>Attitude<p>", "time": "2014-01-13T14:25:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Finnish superfood oats growing healthily - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-superfood-oats-growing-healthily/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Waking up to a warm bowl of oatmeal forms an age-old tradition in Finland. We find out why oats are called a superfood, and how modern Finnish products offer new ways for people to benefit from oats’ nutritional properties to control weight and cholesterol.<p><p>The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recently approved health claims attributed to oats. Oat bran contains high concentrations of a fibre called beta glucan. The approval certifies beta glucan’s ability to lower cholesterol levels, decrease the elevation of blood glucose after a meal and improve digestion, making it a desirable and healthy ingredient.<p><p>Hannu Salovaara, a professor at the University of Helsinki and an expert member of the Finnish Oats Association, patented the yogurt-like oat product marketed as Yosa. “When compared to other cereals,” he says, “oats have a more balanced composition of amino acids, a slightly higher protein content and good quality fat or oil in it.”<p><p>That explains a rise in demand for oats, particularly in Europe and the US. Finland stands to gain from this popularity, as it is the second-largest exporter of oats in the world, sending about 350,000 tons abroad annually.<p><p>Finnish oats are large and pale, qualities that make them attractive to breakfast cereal companies.Photo: Asha Gopalkrishnan<p><p>The factors that contribute to the excellent quality of Finnish oats include the country’s cool weather, clean soil and farming practices that include fewer pesticides and fertilisers. More than a million tons of oats are grown in Finland each year, accounting for 30 percent of all the grain grown there (others include wheat, barley and rye) and 13 percent of all the oats farmed in the EU. Finnish oats are large and pale, qualities that make them attractive to breakfast cereal companies.<p><p>Salovaara points out another advantage associated with oats: They can be successfully used in intercropping with other grains. “When oats are placed between wheat crops, it curbs the spread of diseases that are typical in wheat fields and ensures a good yield,” he explains.<p><p>Humans aren’t the only ones who like oats: The grain is used to increase nutrient and energy content in feed for pets and livestock. Out of the more than one million tons of oats produced in Finland each year, 65 percent goes to animal feed.<p><p>People eat a mere 5 percent of the total, making oats an undervalued food item in Finland despite awareness of its health benefits and a consistent rise in domestic consumption. Salovaara says it’s probably because “you cannot bake a voluminous loaf of bread from oats, as you can from wheat, and eating porridge is too old-fashioned now.” Another reason might be the lack of variety in oat products – that is until recently.<p><p>Finnish bakeries, including Fazer, offer many different sorts of oatbread, such as this one in a traditional-looking round format.Photo: Kristiina Hemminki/Fazer<p><p>Several companies are trying to cash in on oats’ healthy reputation with oat-based products that meet the needs of consumers. One such product is the oat-based weight control drink OATrim, which includes Finnish beta glucan oat fibre and glucomannan, another dietary fibre from the Asian konjac plant.<p><p>Among other health benefits, OATrim aims to provide a feeling of satiety, meaning that the consumer will feel full sooner and therefore eat more moderately. Bozorg Amiri, OATrim’s managing director, says, “Its key strength lies in its packaging, which displays the EFSA-approved weight-loss claim, thereby adding credibility and differentiating itself from the other ‘me-toos’ on the market.”<p><p>Standing out is crucial in a market with an ever-increasing variety of products such as oat drinks, oat smoothies, oat pudding, oat bread, oat snacks and oat crisps. Fazer, a Finnish manufacturer of bakery products and sweets, has recently launched an oat mill in Finland, intending to crank out premium quality oats for consumers within Finland and abroad.<p><p>Players are betting on the oat industry’s growth story, which means that consumers are finding themselves with a growing abundance of choice connected with this Finnish superfood.<p><p>By Asha Gopalkrishnan, January 2014<p><p>Tons of quality<p><p>Oat-based reputation<p>", "time": "2014-06-27T08:29:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Main outlines of Finnish history - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/main-outlines-of-finnish-history/", "review": "", "content": "<p>We’ll run through the main events in Finnish history. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three chapters: the Swedish period prior to 1809, the Russian period from 1809 to 1917, and the independent period from 1917 to the present day.<p><p>Until the middle of the 12th century, the geographical area that is now Finland was a political vacuum, though interesting to both its western neighbour Sweden and the Catholic Church there, and its eastern neighbour Novgorod (Russia) and its Greek Orthodox Church.<p><p>Sweden came out on top, as the peace treaty of 1323 between Sweden and Novgorod assigned only eastern Finland to Novgorod. The western and southern parts of Finland were tied to Sweden and the Western European cultural sphere, while eastern Finland, i.e. Karelia, became part of the Russo-Byzantine world.<p><p>As a consequence of Swedish domination, the Swedish legal and social systems took root in Finland. Feudalism was not part of this system and the Finnish peasants were never serfs; they always retained their personal freedom. Finland’s most important centre was the town of Turku, founded in the middle of the 13th century. It was also the Bishop’s seat.<p><p>Turku Castle is Finland’s oldest medieval castle. Construction began in the 13th century and was completed in the late 16th century. © Visit Finland<p><p>The Reformation started by Luther in the early 16th century also reached Sweden and Finland, and the Catholic Church consequently lost out to the Lutheran faith.<p><p>The Reformation set in motion a great rise in Finnish-language culture. The New Testament was translated into Finnish in 1548 by the Bishop of Turku, Mikael Agricola (1510–1557), who brought the Reformation to Finland and created written Finnish. The entire Bible appeared in Finnish in 1642.<p><p>During its period as a great power (1617–1721), Sweden extended its realm around the Baltic and managed, due to the weakness of Russia, to push the Finnish border further east. With consolidation of the administration in Stockholm, uniform Swedish rule was extended to Finland in the 17th century. Swedes were often appointed to high offices in Finland, which strengthened the position of the Swedish language there.<p><p>When Sweden lost its position as a great power in the early 18th century, Russian pressure on Finland increased, and Russia conquered Finland in the 1808–1809 war with Sweden.<p><p>During the Swedish period, Finland was merely a group of provinces and not a national entity. It was governed from Stockholm, the capital of the Finnish provinces at that time. But when Finland was joined to Russia in 1809 it became an autonomous Grand Duchy. The Grand Duke was the Russian Emperor, whose representative in Finland was the Governor General.<p><p>A view of Helsinki from the late 19th century, by Oscar Kleineh (1846–1919).<p><p>Finland’s highest governing body was the Senate, whose members were Finns. Matters pertaining to Finland were presented to the Emperor in St Petersburg by the Finnish Minister Secretary of State. This meant that the administration of Finland was handled directly by the Emperor and the Russian authorities were therefore unable to interfere.<p><p>The enlightened Russian Emperor Alexander I, who was Grand Duke of Finland from 1809 to 1825, gave Finland extensive autonomy thereby creating the Finnish state. In 1812, Helsinki was made the capital of Finland, and the university, which had been founded in Turku in 1640, was moved to Helsinki in 1828.<p><p>The Finnish national movement gained momentum during the Russian period. The Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, created by Elias Lönnrot, was published in 1835.<p><p>The Language Decree issued in 1863 by Alexander II marked the beginning of the process through which Finnish became an official administrative language. Although only one-seventh of the Finnish population spoke Swedish as its first language, Swedish retained its dominant position until the beginning of the 20th century.<p><p>The Finnish Diet was convened in 1863 after a break of more than half a century. From then on, the Diet met regularly, and active legislative work in Finland began. The Conscription Act of 1878 gave Finland an army of its own.<p><p>The obliteration of “Finnish separatism,” a policy also known as Russification, started during the “first era of oppression” (1899–1905) and continued during the second era (1909–1917). The 1905 Revolution in Russia gave Finland a short breathing spell, while a new legislative body to replace the old Estates was created in 1906. At that time this was the most radical parliamentary reform in Europe, because Finland moved in one bound from a four estate diet to a unicameral parliament and universal suffrage. Finnish women were the first in Europe to gain the right to vote in parliamentary elections.<p><p>On December 6, 1917, Parliament approved the declaration of independence drawn up by the Senate under the leadership of P.E. Svinhufvud (1861–1944).<p><p>At the same time, the breach between the parties of the left and the right had become irreconcilable. At the end of January 1918, the left-wing parties staged a coup, and the government was forced to flee Helsinki. The ensuing Civil War ended in May with victory for the government troops, led by General Gustaf Mannerheim (1867–1951). Finland became a republic in the summer of 1919, and K.J. Ståhlberg (1865–1952) was elected the first president.<p><p>The independent republic developed briskly during the 1920s. The wounds sustained in the Civil War were alleviated by conciliatory measures such as including the Social Democrats in the government; in 1926–1927 they formed a minority government on their own.<p><p>Although Finland first pursued a foreign policy based on cooperation with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the League of Nations was already the cornerstone of Finnish security policy in the 1920s. When the inability of the League of Nations to safeguard world peace became evident in the 1930s, Parliament approved a Scandinavian orientation in 1935.<p><p>In the Winter War Finland stood alone; other countries offered only sympathy and modest assistance. Finnish ski troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian army. Finland’s survival against overwhelming Russian forces became legendary all over the world. © SA-kuva<p><p>In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression pact, which included a secret protocol relegating Finland to the Soviet sphere of interest. When Finland refused to allow the Soviet Union to build military bases on its territory, the latter revoked the nonaggression pact of 1932 and attacked Finland on November 30, 1939. The “Winter War” ended in a peace treaty drawn up in Moscow on March 13, 1940, giving southeastern Finland to the Soviet Union.<p><p>When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, Finland entered the war as a cobelligerent with Germany. The “Continuation War” ended in armistice in September 1944. In addition to the areas already lost to Russia, Finland also ceded Petsamo on the Arctic Ocean. The terms of the armistice were confirmed in the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947.<p><p>Marshal Mannerheim was made president of the republic towards the end of the war. He was succeeded in 1946 by J. K. Paasikivi (1870–1956), whose aim was to improve relations with the Soviet Union.<p><p>The Olympic Games were held in Helsinki in 1952, and in 1955 Finland joined both the United Nations and the Nordic Council. Among the major achievements of Nordic cooperation were the establishment of a joint Nordic labour market in 1954 and a passport union in 1957.<p><p>Urho Kekkonen, who was elected president in 1956, worked to increase Finland’s latitude in foreign policy by pursuing an active policy of neutrality. This was evident for instance in initiatives taken by Finland, such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe held in Helsinki in summer 1975.<p><p>Kekkonen led Finland for a quarter of a century before resigning because of poor health. Mauno Koivisto was elected president in 1982.<p><p>Spring 1987 marked a turning point in the government, when the conservative National Coalition Party and the Social Democrats formed a majority government that remained in power until 1991. After the 1991 election, the Social Democrats were left in opposition, and a new government was formed by the Conservatives and the Centre Party (formerly the Agrarian Party).<p><p>The upheaval that took place at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, including the dissolution of the Soviet Union, was evident in Finland in both a liberalised intellectual atmosphere and in greater latitude in foreign policy. Finland recognised Russia’s position as the successor to the Soviet Union and a treaty on good relations between the neighbouring countries was concluded in January 1992.<p><p>The need and opportunity for Finnish membership in the European Community (EC) increased greatly when Sweden submitted its membership application and the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991. Finland submitted its own application to the EC in March 1992 and the Parliament of the EC (by then the European Union), approved the application in May 1994. In a referendum held in Finland in October 1994, 57 percent of the voters supported membership, and in November 1994 Parliament approved Finnish EU membership as of the beginning of 1995 by a vote of 152-45.<p><p>In the 1995 parliamentary elections the Finnish Centre Party suffered a crushing defeat and Paavo Lipponen, the new chairman of the Social Democratic Party, formed a unique government by Finnish standards. Apart from its backbone, comprising the Social Democrats and the National Coalition, the government included Greens, the Left-Wing Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party.<p><p>Parliamentary elections in spring 2003 also changed the political composition of the government. The National Coalition Party was excluded from Centre Party leader Anneli Jäätteenmäki’s government, which comprised the Centre Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Swedish People’s Party. Jäätteenmäki herself, under political pressure, soon had to resign and in June 2003 Matti Vanhanen became prime minister.<p><p>In 2006, an unexpectedly close presidential election took place. The incumbent, President Tarja Halonen, representing the left side of the political spectrum, defeated her opponent Sauli Niinistö, from the conservative National Coalition Party, by less than four percentage points.<p><p>In the elections of 2007, the Parliament shifted noticeably to the right when the National Coalition Party scored a big victory and the Social Democratic Party suffered a marked loss. Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, from the Centre Party, continued in his post, gathering together a conservative–centrist coalition government, which began its term in April 2007. Of 20 ministers, eight represented the Centre Party and eight the National Coalition Party. The Green Party and the Swedish People’s Party were also granted ministerial posts.<p><p>Finland’s security policy has recently been the subject of energetic debate. Adding their own spice to the discourse were the enlargements of the European Union and NATO in 2004, events that placed Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, Finland’s neighbours to the south, among the new members of both organisations. In June 2008, Finland’s Parliament approved the changes to the constitution of the European Union in the Treaty of Lisbon.<p><p>By Dr Seppo Zetterberg, professor of history, University of Jyväskylä, updated May 2017<p><p>The Swedish reign<p><p>Finland as a Grand Duchy of Russia<p><p>The independent republic<p><p>Recent history<p><p> Presidents of Finland<p>", "time": "2014-01-09T09:34:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Satu Viskari proves that they can as CEO of Mentalwear, purveyor of in-your-face T-shirts.<p><p>Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia shouldn’t be taken lightly. But it would be even worse to brush the problem aside. Satu Viskari and her company, Mentalwear, raise awareness of social taboos surrounding mental health by printing T-shirts with catchy slogans on touchy topics.<p><p>Mentalwear merges these elements into a successful business, with some of the profits going to mental health care organisations. This year Mentalwear is collaborating closely with the Finnish Association for Mental Health (Mielenterveysseura).<p><p>Crazy; it won’t work. That’s what Satu Viskari’s boss thought of the original idea back in 1998 when she came up with the idea of printing “I hear voices” and “Psycho Killer” on T-shirts for a jumble sale organised by the private clinic where she was employed as a mental health worker. The young crowd at a Helsinki venue where Viskari wore one of her shirts thought otherwise, and a business started to emerge. Ten years on, her company Mentalwear is renowned in Finland for making T-shirts with texts such as “Deadline”, “Maniac light” and “Downloading schizophrenia”.<p><p>Coincidence? A sign urges caution during roadwork outside the shop, but also draws attention to the T-shirts within.Photo: Jens Alderin<p><p>Has mental illness become cool in Finland? No. The idea is to raise awareness of real problems.<p><p>“A big watershed for us was an awareness campaign initiated by Finnish TV channel SubTV in 2004 in cooperation with Mentalwear. It created a lot of publicity and helped to raise a substantial sum of money for mental healthcare.” “Getting celebrities to at least ‘wear a problem’ was a big gesture towards gaining recognition for patients,” says Viskari. “They appreciated that. Although as one of my ex-patients put it, healthy people are mere copies.”<p><p>Don’t the shirts provoke negative reactions? Especially in a country that has been deeply shaken by two school massacres in recent years and linked to the persistent Nordic myth of high suicide rates and widespread mental health problems? After all, these are serious matters that are all too seldom properly understood.<p><p>“We get very little negative feedback, if any,” says Viskari, whose own mother died as a result of depression. “Patients, their families and mental health care workers were actually the first key cluster of clients.<p><p>Finnish pop band PMMP participated in a campaign against sexual harassment, donning Mentalwear that reads “Hands off, creep!”Photo: Mentalwear<p><p>Working for Mentalwear isn’t your ordinary customer service work, either. Viskari recounts the story of a recent client who was planning her suicide and wanted to buy a “Deadline” shirt. It’s a chilling thought, but luckily many of the salespeople at the shop in central Helsinki have worked previously as mental health nurses, just like Viskari. The young woman received help – her action should be seen as a last cry for help rather than a cold, calculated act.<p><p>Viskari did consider withdrawing a T-shirt with the text “F**king waves”, written in Finnish, after the tsunami incident in Thailand. She decided not to when she received a letter from a tsunami victim’s mother who liked the shirt because it channelled her anger.<p><p>The positive feedback might seem to indicate that few true taboos exist about mental health. The truth is not that clear. Viskari discloses that a problem with humour is that some customers seem to miss the issue and interpret the slogan as a pure laugh.<p><p>Celebrities mostly still avoid talking about painful personal experiences. The fear of being stigmatized is still real. Campaigning for a problem and suffering from one are still distinguishable issues. Finnish model and mother Elina Nurmi, 23, formed an exception by recently giving interviews discussing her bipolar disorder and hypomania. The response on internet discussion boards has been very mixed, to say the least.<p><p>Shame: Do the expression and the T-shirt match?Photo: Mentalwear<p><p>Raising the issue of mental health and bringing it to the forefront is one thing. Taking action is another. Viskari commends the excellent quality of mental health care in Finland but stresses that there is still much to be done about the high threshold for receiving treatment and seeing to the needs of young people.<p><p>The concept of Mentalwear comes down to something most welfare state supporters should be proud of. It’s a private business venture that both supports and criticises Finnish society and the healthcare system. It is also about society adjusting to the problem, which in turn would make it easier for people with problems to readjust to society. Hopefully that dialogue will continue, and not just on T-shirts. <p><p>By Jens Alderin, June 2009<p><p>Healthy people are mere copies<p><p>Serious matters<p><p>No ordinary job<p><p>Action to follow words<p>", "time": "2013-12-04T12:23:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "’Twas the night before PISA in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/twas-the-night-before-pisa-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Guess what? Kids in Finland are no more enthusiastic about homework than children anywhere else in the world. However, Finland has something that most other countries lack – it’s just hard to define what that something is.<p><p>The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), conducted every three years, evaluates education systems worldwide by testing the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students.<p><p>The testing always assesses reading, science and mathematics, but spotlights one of them each time. Since the programme started in 2000, Finland has made a name for itself, achieving results that place it at or close to the top in all categories every time.<p><p>The country has seen an influx of educators from all over the world coming to observe, study and try to understand the secret of Finland’s success.<p><p>An education export organisation called Future Learning Finland has sprung up to facilitate transfer of knowledge to countries that see potential benefits in various Finnish practices and would like to localise them.<p><p>The run-up to each PISA announcement also sees some speculation about how Finland stacks up against the other elite-tier countries in the survey, the number of which has continued expanding since its inception in 2000.<p><p>Yet in Finland speculation is not as rampant as you might think.<p><p>One Finnish success factor is the system’s reliance on in-class evaluations by teachers instead of standardised testing. Photo: Riitta Supperi/Team Finland<p><p>In any case, there is not much point in constant conjecture about gold, silver and bronze – we’re talking about PISA, not the Olympics.<p><p>It’s far more fruitful to seek insight into what actually brought Finland to the top in the first place. With Finland’s excellent PISA rankings over the years, debate has blossomed. The success factors remain the same from PISA to PISA, and in Finland’s case they form part of a process that began decades ago when the country decided to invest in education.<p><p>Political, economic and social momentum coincided in Finland in the late 1960s to guarantee every child a nine-year education at comprehensive school. “A good education was seen as an essential human right,” says Erkki Aho, former director of the Finnish National Board of Education, in 100 Social Innovations from Finland, a collection of Finnish milestones (SKS, 2013). Education in Finland is also free, from preschool through university.<p><p>Aho also notes that teacher education was reformed at the same time the school system was redesigned. Since then, teachers have had to obtain a master’s degree in order to qualify. Competition for places in teacher-training programmes is tough, and the profession is highly respected.<p><p>All-inclusive system: Schools from all areas of Finland achieve similar, good results. Photo: Riitta Supperi/Team Finland<p><p>Pasi Sahlberg, director of the Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, has become a sort of travelling ambassador for the Finnish education system. In his book Finnish Lessons (Teachers College Press, 2011), he speaks of “equity of outcomes,” meaning “a socially fair and inclusive education system that is based on equality of educational opportunities.”<p><p>This refers to more than just free education. The practice of dividing students into different tracks based on ability was abolished in the 1980s, Sahlberg notes.

The challenges are great enough in top-level sport if you’re able-bodied. People with disabilities have to fight even harder if they have ambitions to be Paralympians – and it offers no advantage if, like Tähti, you have a surname that means “star.”<p><p>Leo-Pekka Tähti whoops it up after crossing the finish line in London at the 2012 ParalympicsPhoto: Maiju Torvinen/Lehtikuva<p><p>Tähti took the gold medal in the 100-metre T54-class wheelchair sprint at the 2012 London Paralympics, clocking a world-record time. He has become a standard bearer for “disabled sports” in Finland and offers inspiration for future Paralympians.<p><p>“Ever since I was a child, I have been interested in sports and competing,” he says. “Competition is in my blood. I started wheelchair racing when I was 15, when I got a racing chair for the first time and I was able to try the sport properly. I didn’t have any role models.” Membership of a club, Porin Tarmo, formed the next milestone. “Sponsors were really hard to find at a time when there hadn’t been any success or publicity. Disabled sports also involve big expenses, and this is one of the biggest problems for disabled sports.” Tähti remains a member of Porin Tarmo.<p><p>Finland’s Amanda Kotaja smiles after qualifying for the 100-metre sprint finals at the London Paralympics; she set a new European record and came in fourth. Photo: Maiju Torvinen/Lehtikuva<p><p>In Finland the situation is relatively good for would-be Paralympians compared with many other countries, says Tähti. “For example, top disabled athletes can get Ministry of Education tax-exempt sports grants. Also, many of the disabled sports are integrated into an association, which is heading in a good direction.”<p><p>Even so, he believes that more could and should be done. “For success in the future, it should be possible to invest more in the recruitment of young athletes. The main threats are that promising athletes stop competing when those who are currently the best and most experienced stop.”<p><p>The allocation of lottery funds, for example, could be increased to help the Paralympics in the same way as it supports the Olympics.<p><p>Just the same, and not least because of Tähti’s high-profile Paralympic success, disabled sports have gained momentum in recent years in Finland. In 2014, for example, the city of Espoo hosted the International Blind Sports Association Goalball World Championships.<p><p>At the International Paralympic Committee’s 2013 Athletics World Championships, Tähti (centre) got gold again, while the Netherlands’ Kenny van Weeghel (left) took silver and Germany’s Marc Schuh won bronze. Photo: Maiju Torvinen/Lehtikuva<p><p>“The attitude of the Paralympian must be that of the top sportsman,” says Tähti. “You’ve got to love training and learn from your mistakes. No single sportsman rises to the top alone. He or she also needs support from [friends and family], as well as others in the sport.”<p><p>Tähti’s ambition still burns fiercely. “My success at London was just one of the wonderful high points in my career,” he says.<p><p>“I also think of the 100-metre and 200-metre wins at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 and my first world championship in New Zealand in 2011.”<p><p>Täht also has his sights set on achieving a faster 100-metre world record at Rio de Janeiro in 2016 – and a fifth Paralympic gold medal!”<p><p>By Tim Bird, November 2013, updated August 2015<p><p>Naturally competitive<p><p>Investment needed<p><p>Fierce ambition<p>", "time": "2013-11-27T13:08:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Recovery rates are near 100 percent. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Finnish recycling figures are particularly praiseworthy when it comes to returnable bottles and cans within the nationwide deposit scheme. The return rate for refillable glass bottles is almost 100 percent. For recyclable aluminium beverage cans and plastic bottles, recovery rates are 96 percent and 94 percent. Finland also leads the way on paper recycling with a recycling rate of 93 percent in 2011, which is very high by European standards. This is largely because Finland has a well-established paper industry able to use the recovered paper. Used paper has been collected in Finland for almost a century, while in many other countries this is still a new green idea.<p><p>Paper recycling has a long history in Finland, where the large paper industry is able to re-use the material. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>“Our infrastructure for recycling household wastes is generally good, especially in towns and cities,” explains Stén. Apartment blocks and housing cooperatives have their own handy shared collection points for paper, organic waste and, increasingly, cardboard and cartons, making recycling easy. Supermarkets and shopping centres also have collection points for metals and glass. Used batteries and lamps can be returned to shops that sell those products, and the same will soon be true for all used electronic devices. Finnish homes generate about 340 kilos of household waste per person per year. About a third of this is compostable organic waste; nearly one-fifth is paper; plastics make up another fifth, and the rest mainly consists of textiles and packaging materials including glass, cartons and metals. Finland’s National Waste Plan aims to ensure that more than half of the material content of household waste is recycled by 2016. “Our target is achievable, though challenging,” says Stén. “In 2011 the figure was about 35 percent, but we want Finnish households to sort their waste even more effectively.” This recovered material content includes glass, paper, cardboard, cartons and metals, as well as organic waste, which is centrally composted for use in public parks and green spaces.<p><p>Shown here during construction and commencing operations in 2014, this incineration and power plant in Vantaa, north of Helsinki, can recover energy as waste is destroyed. Photo: Martti Kainulainen/Lehtikuva<p><p>Like many other countries, Finland is struggling to find ways to recycle problematic plastic wastes. Finnish shoppers have long had to pay for their plastic carrier bags, which are widely reused. “But the problem is there are so many other kinds of plastic packaging with different recycling properties,” says Stén. “We can’t expect householders to become plastic sorting experts, but there is scope for improving the recovery of reusable hard plastics.” The national plan envisages that after recovering all usable materials, the maximum possible amount of the remaining waste will be used to generate energy. This includes most plastics. “By 2016 we should have seven energy recovery plants around Finland where waste will be incinerated,” says Stén. “Here in Finland, by using combined heat and power technologies, we can maximise the amounts of energy obtained from waste for district heating systems as well as electricity. “Our municipal waste management companies reckon that with the help of these energy recovery plants by 2016 we could reduce the proportion of household waste ending up in landfill sites to perhaps as little as 5 percent, which would represent great progress.”<p><p>By Fran Weaver, November 2013<p><p>Handy collection points<p><p>Drastic solutions for plastic<p>", "time": "2013-11-15T14:13:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

For Swedish, the “other” language in this officially bilingual country, the generation now in school represents the future. Finnish Swedish Heritage Day is celebrated annually on November 6.<p><p>About 200 kids between the ages of 13 and 16 study at Sököviken School in Espoo, just west of Helsinki. At this public sector comprehensive school, all subjects are taught in Swedish, which is the first language of about 8 percent of Espoo’s residents.<p><p>Finland is officially bilingual, thanks to demographic history that stretches back about 1,000 years. Across the whole country, 5.4 percent of the population are registered as Swedish speakers. They’re known as Finland-Swedes, but don’t make the mistake of thinking they’re Swedish – they most definitely consider themselves Finns.<p><p>Sököviken deputy principal Henrica Donner explains that, outside school, the pupils live in a social environment where Finnish predominates. “About half come from families where both [Finnish and Swedish] are spoken at home,” she says. “We don’t worry about what language the pupils speak between classes or on the playground, but during the lessons the language is Swedish.<p><p>“Most of our pupils have a very strong Swedish-speaking identity, and the school system plays a big part in preserving this. They’ve typically been to kindergarten and primary school in Swedish, and nearly all go on to Swedish upper secondary schools.”<p><p>Elis Högnäs leads a lesson at Sököviken School. Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Ninth-grader John Nyholm, 15, speaks Finnish well, but feels that Swedish is definitely his first language and the best language for learning. “It’s very good that we have the chance to study in our home language all the way through school,” he says.<p><p>After attending kindergarten and primary school just a few hundred metres from his home, Nyholm travels about three kilometres (1.8 miles) to his present school by bike or bus. “I’ll probably go on to the nearest Swedish upper secondary school, just a bus ride away, though for university I might prefer to go abroad,” he says.<p><p>University-level tuition in Swedish is available in Finland at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki, at Åbo Akademi in the southwestern city of Turku, and in some subjects at the officially bilingual University of Helsinki. Swedish-speaking teachers are trained in Vaasa. This total provision of higher education is reasonable, considering that Finland’s total Swedish-speaking population only numbers some 290,000.<p><p>It doesn’t matter whether kids speak Finnish or Swedish while playing in the schoolyard, but inside the school, education takes place in Swedish. Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>“The right to choose to receive schooling in either Finnish or Swedish anywhere in Finland is enshrined in our legislation,” explains Anders Björklöf, the education spokesperson of Folktinget, an independent but officially recognised organisation. Known in English as the Swedish Assembly of Finland, the group lobbies for Swedish-speaking people’s rights across Finland.<p><p>Björklöf reckons that about 99 percent of those who want to study in Swedish can also do so through the state school system, especially if they live in officially bilingual municipalities where at least 3,000 residents or 8 percent of the population are registered as Swedish-speakers.<p><p>In rural regions of Finland, and especially farther away from the coastal regions where most Swedish-speakers live, pupils sometimes study in small, separate Swedish-language classes on the local Finnish school’s premises, or they may have to travel some distance from home to reach their school. “The municipality where you live may have to find you a place in the nearest municipality with a Swedish school, and also arrange for free transportation to and from school,” explains Björklöf.<p><p>Pupils at Finland’s Swedish-language schools all study Finnish, too. Most of them will later have to cope in predominantly Finnish-language working environments. More controversially, their counterparts in Finnish-speaking schools are likewise obliged to study some Swedish, even in regions where it is seldom spoken. Björklöf feels this is essential as a question of equality between the country’s two official languages, though he would like to see Swedish taught in more motivating ways to improve its popularity among Finnish-speaking schoolchildren.<p><p>Swedish-language schools such as Sököviken provide a vital social focus for their linguistic minority communities within the officially bilingual country of Finland. Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Sököviken School’s Swedish teacher Monique Hult feels that maintaining bilingual education in Finland is also essential to upholding a whole distinct culture with its own social, literary and artistic traditions. “Ending the Swedish-language school system would probably ultimately lead to the end of the language here,” she says.<p><p>The teachers from Sököviken point out that Swedish schools also provide a vital social focus for linguistic minority communities in towns like Espoo. “Parents’ meetings, sports clubs and other activities arranged at school are one of the most important ways that Swedish-speaking families keep in touch with each other,” adds Henrica Donner, the deputy principal.<p><p>Members of this well-served linguistic minority clearly value and resolutely defend their official right to receive public services like education and healthcare in Swedish. Statistics show that parents are keen to send their kids to Swedish-language schools.

Along the way minibuses may pick up or drop off other passengers whose departure points and destinations are logistically compatible.<p><p>The pilot scheme already has more than 4,300 registered users, who load funds into their personal virtual “trip wallets” to pay fares priced between taxi and bus fares. Fares are based on distances “as the crow flies,” not counting detours required by other passengers. “Feedback has been very positive,” says Rissanen, “though most of our initial users have been technophile ‘early adapters’ and we’re still trying to make the system more user-friendly for everyone.<p><p>“Resources are limited during this subsidised pilot phase, but the streamlined high-speed process enables scalability, and our aim is to expand into a viable service covering all of greater Helsinki. Such schemes require a critical mass of vehicles and users for cost-efficiency to take off as vehicle occupation rates increase,” says Rissanen, who hopes the Kutsuplus fleet will expand to 45 minibuses in 2014 and 100 by 2016.<p><p>HRT’s ground-breaking scheme has already attracted international interest across Scandinavia and in Russia, China, Singapore and Luxembourg. “We feel it’s a much more ecological mode of transport than private car use, but flexible enough to attract people who would otherwise travel by car,” adds Rissanen.<p><p>Great to be green: Oskar Räisänen, director of GreenRiders, plans to thin the number of vehicles in Helsinki’s rush hour.

The 10,000-square-metre building elicited an unlikely response: It has become the living room of the whole neighbourhood.<p><p>More than just a place to study art, math and literature: Saunalahti School is designed to serve schoolchildren and the surrounding community. Photo: Andreas Meichsner/Verstas<p><p>“The building is in maximum use almost around the clock,” says school principal Hanna Sarakorpi. “There is a lot of synergy all of us can benefit from.”<p><p>The school was built as more than just a place to study art, math and literature. It was meant to become a focal point for its corner of Espoo, according to Ilkka Salminen, who co-created the building with his partners at Verstas, Väinö Nikkilä, Jussi Palva and Riina Palva.<p><p>The school’s library is open to the public in the evening, while cooperation between the school, the daycare and the youth centre is constantly growing.<p><p>Parts of the school, such as Saunalahti Library, stay open to serve the public during the evening. Photo: Andreas Meichsner/Verstas<p><p>Consistently ranked as a top education leader by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Finnish school system offers more than just academic support: health, dental and counselling services are available through the schools and help ensure students’ wellbeing.<p><p>An OECD report notes that, since the first PISA in 2000, “Finnish schools have become a kind of tourist destination,” where educators and policymakers from around the world try to decipher “the secret of success.”<p><p>In the 2000, 2003 and 2006 PISA surveys, Finland took top honours in literacy, mathematics and science, and it remained in the top 10 in 2009 despite moving to sixth in mathematics, second in sciences and third in reading. (At the time of writing, the 2012 results have not yet been released – the release date is December 3, 2013.)<p><p>Qualifying as a teacher in Finland – even a primary school teacher – requires a university degree. Education degree programmes at Finnish universities enjoy a great deal of popularity, and admission is notoriously competitive.<p><p>The school is designed to encourage nontraditional classroom settings and various kinds of group learning. Photo: Andreas Meichsner/Verstas<p><p>Saunalahti School was designed to integrate a nontraditional classroom into the education experience for new ways of learning – with an emphasis on collaboration. For example, glass walls between classrooms allow students to work in groups and “were built primarily to support the pedagogical idea of the school,” says Salminen.<p><p>There’s room to get away, as well. Sarakorpi notes that the children love to explore the sprawling schoolyard or just sit and read on the windowsills.<p><p>“Some students don’t feel comfortable in a [traditional] classroom,” says Salminen. “Every interior and exterior space is a potential place for learning.”<p><p>The workshop-friendly classrooms have glass doors which open to neighbouring student groups, while there is enough open spaces in the broad hallways to sit, work and study. In other words, the design supports learning outside of the classrooms.<p><p>Saunalahti School’s huge windows let in as much light as possible. Photo: Andreas Meichsner/Verstas<p><p>It began in 2008, when 13 architects at Verstas started designing the school. Construction commenced in 2010 and was completed in 2012. Since then, the building has made an impact at the educational and community levels.<p><p>One side of the three-floor building incorporates a swooping glass wall with a curved wooden roof that looks a bit like a ski slope. The architects had to be careful that the building would not cast a shadow onto the schoolyard. The curvaceous glass structure contains a daycare, preschool, public library and youth club. Square windows of various sizes are scattered over one wavy wall, looking out onto the open school yard.<p><p>For the school, the biggest challenge was staying within the budget and the physical parameters, says Sarakorpi. As for the architects, they wanted to allow as much light as possible into the school so children could maximise their daylight hours during the dark Finnish winters, when the short days amount to the exact opposite of the Nordic summer’s white nights.<p><p>Apparently, it’s the inner light that matters. The central fireplace in the foyer acts as the heart of the school.<p><p>“We think that inspiring architecture may give a child a positive drive for growing up and learning things,” says Salminen, “and turn the learning moments into thrilling experiences.”<p><p>By Nadja Sayej, September 2013<p><p>Deciphering the secret of success<p><p>Nontraditional classrooms<p><p>Inspiring architecture encourages learning<p>", "time": "2013-10-07T08:16:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

The international Finlandia Trophy competition is held every autumn in the Helsinki area.<p><p>“Figure skating is a multifaceted sport, because it combines athletics and aesthetics,” says synchronised skating coach Katariina Luotonen. “You can express yourself through movement and music and practise skating along with dance, ballet and gymnastics to improve your body power and grace. The feeling when you are speeding across the ice is amazing.”<p><p>Luotonen began figure skating at five and participated in both single figure skating and synchronised skating with one of Finland’s top teams, Marigold Ice Unity. She later moved into coaching, and works with Tikkurila Figure Skating Club, located just north of Helsinki and known by its Finnish abbreviation, TTK.<p><p>Always popular in Finland, figure skating continues to grow, attracting people of all ages. Clubs throughout Finland offer training in single (individual) skating, synchronised (group) skating and ice dance in pairs.<p><p>Young girls of the Tikkurila Figure Skating Club train on ice four times a week.Photo: Susanna Alatalo<p><p>Synchronised skating, especially, has seen a rise in popularity since the 1990s. It’s a team sport in which eight to 20 skaters perform a programme together. It utilises the same judging system as other figure skating events, and is characterised by teamwork, speed, intricate formations and challenging step sequences.<p><p>“Being a single skater is very competitive, and most of the time you train by yourself,” Luotonen explains. “Synchronised skating is a team sport, which makes it more fun. As with all team sports, the team spirit comes from doing things together and working towards a common goal. The support from your team members while sharing success, failure, joy and sorrow are assets that will stay with you throughout your life.”<p><p><p><p> <p><p>Ice skating is regarded as a basic skill in Finland, comparable to swimming or riding a bike. Every child learns to skate at a young age. Because of the long winters, they also have ample opportunity to practice outdoors, as many soccer fields are transformed into ice rinks.<p><p>Children of all ages gather after school to play ice hockey or figure skate with their friends. Ice skating is also included in physical education lessons at school.In addition nearly every city has indoor skating rinks, many of which are in year-round use.<p><p>Luotonen believes several reasons exist for the growing popularity of synchronised skating: “The team spirit, the show element and the success of Finnish skating teams in competitions all over the world are drawing more and more children to this sport.”<p><p>In April 2013, Finland’s Team Unique won the world championship. In previous years, Finnish teams Marigold Ice Unity and Rockettes have taken turns winning the gold medal with Sweden and Canada. Meanwhile, the success of single figure skaters Kiira Korpi and Laura Lepistö has made them into idols for young skating enthusiasts.<p><p>“If you wish to be successful [at the top level], you need to start early,” Luotonen says, but adds that there is no age limit to when you can start a new hobby. You can start lessons as early as three years old, but skating lessons and teams for adult beginners are also available.<p><p>In team sports like synchronised skating, team members gain a lot of support from their peers.Photo:Joukkue Ice Melody<p><p>“Ice Melody, one of the teams I am coaching at TTK, consists of 23 energetic girls aged 8 to 12,” says Luotonen. “They are such a fun, spontaneous group of girls, who always make me laugh. They train on ice four times a week, in addition to dance classes and fitness training.<p><p>“My goal is to teach them to grow into young athletes, making healthy choices in all parts of life in order to achieve certain targets. At this age, targets are not measured in results or medals, but in growth on a personal and team level.”<p><p>By Catarina Stewen, September 2013<p><p>Every child learns to skate<p><p>No age limit for a new hobby<p>", "time": "2013-10-04T11:57:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Everyone has a story from their country and traditions that we speak about in class.”<p><p>Also in the same class, Indonesian Abdurrahman Tauhid appreciates the importance of communicating in the local language, having arrived in Finland eight months ago to live with his girlfriend.<p><p>“Most people here speak English, but you really need to speak Finnish to get a job,” he observes. “Finnish is a hard language, but I want to learn it and live here. Everything is possible, as long as you believe in yourself.”<p><p>Aside from acquiring a job here in their chosen profession, students at Työväenopisto have different motives for learning the language.<p><p>“I started to learn Finnish as I have a baby here,” explains Spaniard Julio Ortiz. “I want to help when he eventually goes to school and starts to do his homework.”<p><p>Italian Paolo Bucciarelli recently decided to learn Finnish, hoping to feel more a part of the community here. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>However, for some, their motivation is not a matter of the necessity of work or family commitments. After living here on and off for nearly seven years, Italian music producer Paolo Bucciarelli recently decided that the time is right to try his hand at the local language.<p><p>“There comes a point that if you want to be a part of the community you need to speak it,” he explains. “Especially as the old generation doesn’t really speak English.”<p><p>Given the wide array of choices for studying Finnish on offer at a variety of institutions, why would he then choose Työväenopisto?<p><p>“A friend of mine studied Italian here and recommended it, as he received good tuition and it is quite cheap. I thought, ‘okay, let’s give it a try’. The best way is to just jump in and stay afloat. I am taking it in a philosophical way: at least at the end of this course I will know more than when I started.”<p><p>Aside from Finnish language, courses at Työväenopisto community colleges encompass a diverse range of subjects. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Nowadays, one doesn’t actually need to participate in a classroom discussion in order to learn Finnish. While a quick Google search reveals a number of different avenues online, one of the most popular has been that of Kesäyliopisto (summer university).<p><p>“I started giving courses online three years ago,” explains Anne Palokangas, lecturer at the Summer University of Northern Ostrobothnia. “Many people who are living in smaller villages can’t find courses because if there are not enough foreigners living nearby, then courses won’t be organised in that area. Also some people have difficulty leaving home as they have babies, so they can also participate. Sometimes we have cats and dogs and babies crying in the classroom.”<p><p>With students scattered around the country, as well as such far flung regions as the USA, Russia and Asia, the convenience of the Internet is certainly put to good use.<p><p>“It’s so easy to come to class when it’s online,” Palokangas exclaims. “I never know where people are.

See our slideshow below.<p><p>The Finns have achieved international recognition in cross-country skiing, ice hockey, ski jumping, athletics, swimming and orienteering – many sports that could be described as traditional. However, Finland has not missed out on the rise of newer, urban sports – on the contrary. Many cities and towns have responded to young people’s requests by providing a place for them to practice new sports, and many skateparks, climbing walls and other recreation sites have sprung up.<p><p>Nonetheless, it is evidently more thrilling to hit the open city rather than an official practice spot. Rails and benches offer challenges to skateboarders, while glacial boulders beckon rock climbers. And urban sports aren’t limited to the capital, Helsinki. Further north, for instance, Jyväskylä and Lahti have gained a foothold as the most popular parkour cities in Finland. Don’t know what parkour is?

He also makes sure that his tricks do not damage the buildings. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Tuukka shows his parkour skills in Tampere at dusk. Parkour is easy to begin; all you need is a pair of good shoes, and suitable spots can be found in every town.

Maija says that bouldering is usually more about hanging out with friends than intensive training.

{"title": "Finnish autumn brings out the flavours - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-autumn-brings-out-the-flavours/", "review": "", "content": "<p>When autumn arrives, Finns cook up a feast using ingredients found above and below the ground. A Helsinki chef explains what’s so special about fall food in Finland, and even shares a few recipes.<p><p>As the long days of summer fade and autumn approaches, the Finns get back in the swing of working life or recommence their studies, and many people take up new hobbies. The autumn also influences the world of Finnish cuisine.<p><p>“Summer’s always hectic, everything happens really fast,” says Jukka Nykänen, head chef at Helsinki’s Juuri restaurant. “In the autumn everything starts to slow down a bit. I really like it, as the beginning of the season is pretty much the high time of the year in terms of food.”<p><p>The menu at Juuri is made up of “sapas” dishes, a Finnish take on “tapas” (the “s” comes from Suomi, the Finnish word for “Finland.”)Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>A typical Finnish autumn dining table offers an indulgence of delicious seasonal tastes that utilise the abundance of fresh ingredients on hand.<p><p>“It’s the ‘in’ season for almost everything,” Nykänen says enthusiastically. “We have fresh, good-quality vegetables, hunting season starts for different kinds of game and there are many things we can forage for at this time of the year.”<p><p>Indeed, after the summer months spent plucking nature’s goodies, such as berries, from the multitude of forests around the country, there are still plenty of mushrooms to be discovered during the autumn. In fact, the number of varieties on offer actually increases over the autumn, with the last mushrooms of the season eventually being picked from underneath the first blanket of winter snow.<p><p>Juuri serves a vegetarian sausage made with barley and five different kinds of root vegetables.Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>While many ingredients are found aboveground, autumn also sees numerous flavours and textures produced beneath the surface.<p><p>“As a chef, the main thing for me this time of year is that root vegetables are in their prime,” Nykänen explains. “The range of what Finns do with root vegetables these days is much wider than it used to be. They aren’t a necessity for each meal anymore.”<p><p>Given that the name of the restaurant, Juuri, is the Finnish word for “root,” it should come as no surprise that Nykänen’s kitchen concocts numerous combinations of root vegetables.<p><p>“I love to use them all, as they each have a different nature and texture,” he says. “We have a vegetarian sausage made with barley and five different kinds of root vegetables. We also make ketchup from beetroot, and use parsley root in desserts. Your imagination is the only limitation you have.”<p><p>As autumn begins, Finnish outdoor markets may still stock strawberries and blueberries, but the balance soon shifts to black currants (right) and lingonberries.Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Elsewhere around the country as autumn sets in, the northern region of Lapland in particular begins to experience ruska, the annual spectacular bloom of colours as leaves change colour. However, having grown up in Finland’s former capital city of Turku, in the southwest of the country, Nykänen has other memories of the season.<p><p>“When I look back on my childhood, it pretty much revolves around food,” he says, smiling. “My mother and my grandmothers were good cooks. We always ate a lot of cabbage during autumn: cabbage rolls, cabbage casseroles, cabbage stews. We used to fish a lot, catching plenty of pike and perch. Our neighbour was an enthusiastic hunter so we had wild game. I was really lucky.”<p><p>While such seasonal staples are still commonplace in Finnish homes, a lot has changed on the local foodie scene in recent years.<p><p>“Now is the time to build our food culture, as people don’t have preconceived notions of what Finnish dining culture consists of,” Nykänen observes. “We don’t have a long history of dining out. This is a really great time to be in the cuisine field in Finland.”<p><p>And with that, Nykänen is ready to disappear into the kitchen once again, to see what flavoursome innovations he can devise for his customers.<p><p>“With the more traditional dishes of Finnish autumn, such as venison meatballs and cabbage rolls,” says chef Jukka Nykänen of the restaurant Juuri, “the nature and the charm of these dishes is to make them by feel and intuition – therefore it’s more or less impossible to write an exact recipe for them. The following dishes are some that I have used at Juuri, with a focus on root vegetables and mushrooms.”<p><p>Wild mushroom brioche with roast onion cream cheese Brioche:<p><p>approximately 500 g (1 pound, 1.5 ounces) any wild mushrooms you prefer 1 large onion 1 clove of garlic A few sprigs of thyme Fine sea salt and black pepper Butter for frying<p><p>Chop the mushrooms a bit smaller and chop the onion, garlic and thyme finely.

Then I go for a swim in a cold lake and then back into a hot sauna. It’s very refreshing, fun, and feels good.”<p><p>Though not all traditional Finnish cottages have mod cons or are winterized, Lavonen’s cabin has both electricity and running water because she also goes there during the colder winter months.<p><p>Lavonen adds an extra twist to the traditional cottage experience by practicing yoga at her Hämeenkoski cottage. “Nature helps me relax and tune into myself.

On the one hand, it is the sound of growing things, of air through leaves and the flow of my own breath matching the sound of hiking boots swishing through the underbrush. It is echoes that ricochet from the rocks, and it is water gushing over boulders in a nearby stream.<p><p>But in the early morning hours, the silence is a lullaby to soothe the soul. Our adventure soundtrack also contains guest vocals by curious sheep in a nearby field and the strains of Sibelius’ Finlandia on a friend’s flute.<p><p>The rugged scenery around Hell’s Lake comes from deep fault lines. We descend from spacious ridge-top views through a rough, two-metre wide gorge that has attracted visitors since the 1800s.

{"title": "On safari to see rare Finnish lake seals - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/on-safari-to-see-rare-finnish-lake-seals/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finland’s largest lake, Saimaa, is home to the world’s rarest seal. Our reporter embarks on a seal safari to catch a glimpse of an animal that seems to be returning from the brink of extinction.<p><p>The Saimaa ringed seal forms the icon of Finland’s nature conservation movement, and has become an attraction for visitors to Finnish Lakeland. It has even inspired an opera at the famous Savonlinna Opera Festival (see box below).<p><p>As the 12-berth wooden cruise-boat Kaesa leaves Savonlinna in eastern Finland for an overnight seal-spotting voyage, Lake Saimaa’s forest-fringed waters are as calm as a millpond. Though conditions are good, sightings are far from certain, since only about 310 seals live in the 4,400 square kilometres of this vast, labyrinthine lake system. But just before sunset someone shouts “Seal!” and we rush to the railings to spy a dark, whiskered head bobbing in the water. We watch as the seal repeatedly dives for fish and returns to the surface.<p><p>Our guide, nature photographer and filmmaker Juha Taskinen, explains that Saimaa’s seals are a distinct inland variety of the ringed seal, a species found in arctic seas. They adapted to their freshwater habitat after the lake and its inhabitants became cut off from the Baltic Sea some 9,000 years ago.<p><p>Seal seeking: Guests on a Lake Saimaa seal safari search the surface of the water for signs of seals.Photo: Markku Tissarinen<p><p>Taskinen is a dedicated conservationist, but back in the 1940s his grandfather used to hunt lake seals, since fishermen saw them as competitors. “By the 1950s, when they first received protected status, there were probably fewer than 100 left,” he says. “Industrial pollution also affected the seals, but today the lake water is practically clean enough to drink.”<p><p>In recent years the seals’ numbers have risen, but they are still listed as critically endangered. “The greatest threat they face today is fishing nets, since their pups can easily get entangled in nets and drown,” says Taskinen. In recent years about 50 to 60 pups have been born each winter, but every year several perish in nets. A recent ban on the use of nets in some of Saimaa’s waters in springtime has helped, but Taskinen would like to see nets prohibited all year round in all of the seals’ waters.<p><p>Most of Saimaa’s commercial fishers use equipment that does not endanger the seals, but many local residents and holiday-home owners still put out nets. Taskinen explains that seal-friendly fish traps designed and distributed by conservationists can work just as well as nets, but some local fishers remain reluctant to change their tackle.<p><p>A seal pup (left), whom researchers have given the name “Kimmo,” basks in the sun beside its mother.Photo: Juha Taskinen<p><p>Climate change represents another potential threat. “Mother seals raise their pups in snow dens on the frozen lake. In winters in the early 2000s there was too little snow and many pups died. But researchers and volunteers have sometimes helped the seals by piling up man-made snowdrifts along the shores where they breed. The seals have happily used these snowdrifts to make breeding dens,” explains Taskinen.<p><p>A five-year, EU-funded programme called Safeguarding the Saimaa Ringed Seal launching in August 2013 intensifies such successful conservation actions, promotes research into seal behaviour and runs awareness-raising campaigns. Research findings will be used to plan further measures such as the protection of lakeshores against holiday home developments. Studies of radio-tagged seals have already proven that they range over surprisingly long distances searching for fish.<p><p>Conservationists hope the seals’ numbers will keep rising steadily to about 400 by 2025. “That should be enough to remove the imminent threat of extinction, though with such a small total population they will remain vulnerable to disease outbreaks,” says Taskinen.<p><p>“Since they are the only animal found only in Finland, the loss of Saimaa’s seals would be a national shame. Since it is the actions of people that have endangered them, we surely have a moral obligation to save them,” he adds. “I’m quite optimistic overall though, since people clearly want to see them survive, and a lot of good things have been done in recent years to help them.”<p><p>Norppaooppera – The SealIllustration: Kerttu Varis/SOF<p><p>The internationally renowned Savonlinna Opera Festival reverberates each summer in a splendid medieval castle in the heart of Finnish Lakeland.

But the fact that Räikkönen, 28, became champion after several years of trying probably did not surprise anyone who follows the sport.<p><p>Räikkönen’s exceptional talents became known as early as 2001 when he debuted in F1 after skipping over two formula racing series that drivers normally compete in before advancing to the pinnacle of car racing.<p><p>There may have been more confidence in Räikkönen because he’s a Finn. Over the decades Finnish drivers have snapped up Formula One and World Rally Championship titles, as well as winning championships in Grand Prix motorcycle racing,, Motocross, Trial, Enduro, Ice Speedway and Snowcross.<p><p>For years, the directors of rally teams have known the sure-fire recipe for success: “If you want to win, you need a Finn.”<p><p>Relative to its population, Finland has been the number one country in the world in motorsports, measured by international success.<p><p>But what is it that makes Finns so successful?<p><p>Kari O. Sohlberg, Chairman of AKK-Motorsport (AKK), believes that car racing became ingrained in the Finnish psyche back in the days of the Eläintarha Race, which was held in Helsinki from 1932 to 1963.<p><p>In the 1950s, Curt Lincoln (1918-2005) was Finland’s leading racing driver and is regarded as the forefather of the present champions.

Rally drivers have sped on Finnish dirt roads since their teenage years, while all Finnish F1 drivers have started their racing careers in the karting series.<p><p>Professor Matti Urrila, who specialises in the psychological coaching of athletes, believes that it was Rosberg who left Finns with an important cultural legacy a quarter of a century ago.<p><p>“At first, people made fun of him but, in the end, he proved that anything is possible. The victory boosted the confidence of our increasingly motorising nation. No-one’s chances were doubted anymore,” says Urrila, who has long co-operated with Marcus Grönholm and earlier with Mika Häkkinen.<p><p>Matti Urrila stresses that in rally and Formula One circles, personal connections are also important.<p><p>“As a result of our drivers’ success, Finland has an abundance of expertise in how to become a World Champion in Formula One, for instance. Beginning with sponsorship and connections, there is a very realistic understanding of what it takes. And that puts Finland in quite a unique situation,” believes Urrila.<p><p><p><p>Mika Häkkinen celebrates on the podium after winning the 2001 British Grand Prix at Silverstone in 2001.Photo: Lehtikuva<p><p>For example, Keke Rosberg has managed Mika Häkkinen and Jyrki Järvilehto (J. J. Lehto), whilst in rally racing, businessman Timo Jouhki has worked as the manager for Juha Kankkunen, Tommi Mäkinen and Mikko Hirvonen.<p><p>The success of present Finnish (car) racing drivers owes a great deal to AKK’s coaching programme which prepares young, promising karting and rally drivers for an international career. In addition to driver training, the programme includes training camps, psychological coaching, rehearsal in public performance, teamwork and career planning. Kimi Räikkönen and Heikki Kovalainen are examples of drivers who have gone through this coaching programme.<p><p>“We employ coaches from each sport who systematically scout for talents. Three to four prospects are taken into coaching. We also have our own TV productions with which we aim to guarantee publicity for our young talents and their partners in co-operation. We even had motorsport professionals from the UK a few years ago who wanted to share our expertise and get acquainted with our system,” says AKK’s Sohlberg.<p><p>But all of this would not be possible without the special character of the Finnish nation.<p><p>Finnish drivers took the first three places at the Rally of New Zealand in October 2002.

War reparations that had to be paid to the Soviet Union after the Second World War could not have been taken care of with agriculture alone, so we started developing our engineering industry. As a result, our society became mechanised,” Urrila explains.<p><p>It is hardly a coincidence that Kimi Räikkönen has studied as a car mechanic at a vocational college, Mika Häkkinen studied plating and welding and Mika Salo was an electrical fitter.<p><p>The job of a mechanic is also familiar to Juha Kankkunen, Tommi Mäkinen and Marcus Grönholm who have wrestled with tractors while working as farmers in their spare time.<p><p>But the final truth about Finland’s success may be summed up by this:<p><p>“Finns are crazy,” said World Rally Champion Sébastian Loeb in the summer at the Neste Oil Rally Finland, in Jyväskylä, after losing to Marcus Grönholm.<p><p> This article was originally published in Finnish in the weekly news magazine Suomen Kuvalehti, issue 43/2007.<p><p> <p><p> <p><p>By Pekka Anttila of the weekly news magazine Suomen Kuvalehti, November 2007<p><p>Reasons behind the success<p><p>Finnish know-how<p><p>Finnish World Champions<p><p><p><p><p>", "time": "2013-07-16T12:04:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

These days the renovated space is full of light and colour and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.<p><p>Johan &amp; Nyström’s popular raw food brunches, held every second Sunday, sell out well in advance. “We have all been surprised by the positive raw reception,” says Kokko, who credits his yoga instructor Magnus Appelberg with introducing him to the world of raw food.<p><p>Zucchini pasta, avocado tahini, hummus, coleslaw, vegetable-and-herb salad, seed crackers, raw blueberry pie and chocolate brownies are some of the items on the brunch menu.<p><p>Johan &amp; Nyström is housed in a 19th-century brick warehouse that is now full of light, colour and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.Photo: Susanna Alatalo<p><p>In summer, an outdoor waterfront patio overlooks the boats moored in the Baltic, with chairs and tables in bright pinks, yellows and greens. The patio furniture, like much of the interior, has been locally sourced. Kokko is a believer in working with independent local firms, whether he’s ordering interior design elements or desserts. The latter come from gourmet cake maker Suvi Tikamo.<p><p>“Small things become big things when people choose what they consume and where or whom they purchase it from,” says Kokko.<p><p>He officially took over as the café’s owner in December 2012. Previously, the establishment was the Swedish roastery firm’s Helsinki office and occasionally open on Saturdays as a café. The roastery still provides coffee for many other Finnish cafés and restaurants.<p><p>Formerly a professional photographer, Kokko is enjoying his second career as a barista and entrepreneur. The café has also become a family business as Kokko’s wife, Liisa, a stylist and journalist, helps out on the weekends, and the couple’s grown-up children also work there.<p><p>Their clientele is a mix of regulars, both locals and tourists, many of whom request something distinctively Finnish.

It’s important for everyone to learn how they work, including new generations of urban children, as well as immigrants and tourists who may not be used to such rights.”<p><p>Places where rights of access are limited include the gardens of private homes, fields where crops are growing, some nature reserves, industrial areas, military areas and a narrow zone along the Finnish-Russian frontier. Everyman’s Right does not allow the use of motor vehicles off road. It only covers fishing with a simple rod and line (to fish with nets, traps or a reel and lure, you need permits). For some activities, such as hunting or lighting campfires, the landowners’ permission is always required.<p><p>A campfire warms hikers on the banks of Kitkajoki, a river near Kuusamo in northeastern Finland.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>On some issues, the legal definitions related to Everyman’s Right are purposefully unclear. Hikers can freely camp out “temporarily” in unprotected natural areas. On someone else’s land you may not cause “unreasonable disturbance” or “significant damage.”<p><p>Rautiainen explains that this is to allow for common sense and flexibility in the application of the rules. “Considering how near you may go to someone’s home, for instance, no specific distance is defined, because circumstances differ in remote or more built-up areas,” she says. “This usually works well in practice, since Finnish people generally have a good instinctive sense of what will disturb someone else.”<p><p>Anne Rautiainen recently led a team of experts commissioned to compile a weighty official handbook explaining the scope of Everyman’s Right in exhaustive detail. “We hope this new handbook will clarify issues and prevent possible conflicts. But compiling it was much more complicated than we’d expected. We had to consult many lawyers; national and local authorities; and organisations including nature conservationists and landowners’ interest groups,” she says.<p><p>Summer nights: Hikers can freely pitch their tents in unprotected natural areas across Finland.Photo: Elina Sirparanta/Visit Finland<p><p>The thinking behind Everyman’s Right means that across Finland outdoor recreational activities are essentially allowed wherever they are not specifically prohibited – whereas in most countries they are prohibited wherever they are not explicitly allowed.<p><p>Finland’s Everyman’s Right and similar rights enjoyed in Norway and Sweden are so unique globally that they have been suggested for inclusion in UNESCO’s World Intangible Cultural Heritage List. This eclectic list includes such cultural treasures as French cuisine, Argentinean tango and traditional Persian carpet-weaving.<p><p>“Here in Finland we sometimes take Everyman’s Right for granted,” says Rautiainen. “This international publicity could increase our appreciation of these freedoms.

You will not want to miss the Lutheran Cathedral, located on Senate Square.<p><p>(Temppeliaukio Church, in the district of Töölö, is another favourite, but since this article was originally published, it has introduced an admission charge of three euros per person. That hasn’t stopped people from visiting, though. It’s called the rock church – you’ll see why when you get there.)<p><p>Helsinkians in their native environment, hanging out in Esplanade Park.Photo: Jiang Ping/FTB<p><p>The best thing about the city is its friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Its parks are excellent for eating a picnic lunch and listening to music. The Esplanade, in the very centre of the city, is favoured by tourists and locals alike, and the Esplanade bandstand at the eastern end of the park features every imaginable kind of concert and performance on a daily basis during the summer months. Alppi Park, right next to Linnanmäki Amusement Park, is also a recommended venue for music, dance and theatre at weekends. Linnanmäki, on the other hand, is a great locale for snapping a few photos of the Helsinki skyline, as admission to the park and its 53-metre (174-foot) Panoraama viewing tower are free.<p><p>Suomenlinna, a Unesco World Heritage Site located on a group of islands off Helsinki, forms one of the largest sea fortresses in the world. Take the ferry to this wonderful medley of seascapes, terraces and restaurants. (OK, you got us – the ferry to Suomenlinna is not free. But the Helsinki City Transport boat is not expensive.) Wander along twisting cobblestone paths and venture into the tunnels under the fortress walls.<p><p>Seurasaari Open-Air Museum also provides a great setting for an evening stroll through history.

Most clubs require an entrance fee, but there are places with free entry too, especially on weekday nights. Pubs generally do not have entry fees. Stand-up comedy is featured at Teerenpeli, a pub next to Kamppi shopping centre.<p><p>You might also consider a moonlight swim at Hietaniemi Beach – or perhaps a sunlight swim would be a more appropriate term, since it never really gets dark at night during summer in Finland.<p><p>Helsinki is a beautiful city with influences from several different cultures. Cultural history and architecture buffs will find it worthwhile to look around neighbourhoods with very different characters. Kallio is a favourite with artists and students. The lovely villas by the sea around the waterside park Kaivopuisto are also worth a visit, as are the walking paths around Töölö Bay. Every tourist coach makes a mandatory stop at Sibelius Park, where visitors can admire the sprawling metallic monument dedicated to Finland’s most famous composer.<p><p>On top of all this, Helsinki has a reputation as a prestigious design city.

{"title": "Finnish Nature Centre offers walk on the wild side - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-nature-centre-offers-walk-on-the-wild-side/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The Finnish Nature Centre Haltia, on the fringes of beautiful Nuuksio National Park, showcases modern ecological wooden construction techniques as well as Finland’s natural treasures.<p><p>Opened in summer 2013, the Finnish Nature Centre Haltia provides an attractive window into wild Finland just 25 kilometres (15 miles) from downtown Helsinki. The centre’s main exhibition features superb images of wildlife, landscapes and natural phenomena from around the country – and especially from Finland’s 37 national parks. Haltia managing director Timo Kukko explains that the centre seeks to awaken visitors’ interest in nature by presenting the kinds of sights, sounds and feelings they can enjoy in Finland’s great outdoors. The exhibition uses modern experiential audiovisual techniques instead of dusty stuffed animals or dry lists of facts. Haltia is expected to become a major attraction for nature-loving tourists visiting the Finnish capital. “We think about half of our 150,000 to 200,000 visitors a year will be foreigners,” says Kukko. “The exhibits have been planned to provide them with a memorable introduction to our natural treasures.”<p><p>A balcony of the ecologically constructed Haltia Finnish Nature Centre offers a view of the surrounding forest and a lake.Photo: Paavo Lehtonen/Haltia<p><p>As befits a building that showcases nature and is located in a splendid setting on a rocky slope overlooking a lake, Haltia utilises the ecological benefits of innovative timber construction techniques. “Solar panels, ground-source heat, waste-heat reclamation systems and modern energy-saving technologies make the building 75 percent energy-self-sufficient,” says Kukko. Haltia is the first major public building in Finland to be constructed completely from cross-laminated timber elements. These robust elements are largely clad with Finnish spruce wood – dark brown on the exterior but light inside, just like a tree. Strategically sited windows and balconies offer enticing views of the lake and the surrounding pinewoods and birch groves from the centre’s exhibition rooms, restaurant, meeting spaces and nature classrooms. The roof of the building is literally green, covered with plants that will soak up carbon, sunlight and rainwater. Swallows are already preparing to nest in Haltia’s wooden observation tower – as if to show that nature approves of its own celebratory monument.<p><p>A wooden structure shaped like an egg, shown here during construction, houses unique artwork in one of Haltia’s exhibition spaces.Photo: Aura Piha/Metsähallitus<p><p>The oval shape of the building and its top-heavy viewing tower make it resemble a duck sitting on her nest and looking towards the lake. “One theme we wanted for the combined design of the building and its main exhibition is a link to Finnish mythology,” says architect Rainer Mahlamäki. “People have always loved stories, and we want to retell the creation myth from our national folk epic Kalevala, where the whole universe hatches from the egg of a goldeneye duck.” <p><p>In one corner of the main exhibition space stands a huge, wooden, latticed structure shaped like an egg. This giant egg houses a unique artwork, The Game of Life, created by Finnish artist Osmo Rauhala, in which two swans play chess surrounded by ever-changing kaleidoscopic images reflected in mobile mirrors. <p><p>Another permanent exhibition at Haltia features wild attractions within easy reach of Helsinki, aiming to encourage city-dwellers and Helsinki’s foreign visitors to get out and explore. The centre’s staff can provide plenty of tips about what to see and do, both in the immediate surroundings and across the country. <p><p>After absorbing Haltia’s exhibitions, adventurous visitors can head straight down to the lakeshore to rent rowboats or canoes, or follow tempting trails leading towards the deep green forests and secluded lakes of nearby Nuuksio National Park. The park is home to woodland wildlife, from owls, woodpeckers and hawks to mighty moose, elusive lynxes and the rare flying squirrel.<p><p>By Fran Weaver, May 2013<p><p>Green building in a green setting<p><p>Sitting duck design<p>", "time": "2013-08-27T07:58:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Dive fearlessly into declensions and traverse verb conjugations valiantly, and you’ll emerge with newfound confidence. One classic grammar book and two newer volumes help pave your way.<p><p>When speaking, you can effortlessly substitute the informal sä for sinä (you) and use onks instead of onko (meaning “is it?”). All well and good, but to reach the essence of the Finnish language you have to know your endings. You’ve probably built up a great deal of passive knowledge – now you just have to solidify it.<p><p>Trampoline grammar: It seems extremely unlikely that this Finnish person will ever have use for the negative participle of the verb “hypellä” (to jump around). Photo: Rodeo<p><p>Verbs show how streamlined Finnish is: The future tense doesn’t exist – Finns just use the present tense, none of that future indicative you struggled with in French class. However, Finnish verbs do contain certain twists and turns, so a conjugation table is in order. Guide to Finnish Verbs: 120 Finnish verbs fully conjugated (Finnlibri) offers help.<p><p>Strangely, part of the fun is reading all the forms you’ll probably never have any occasion to utter. Even Finnish speakers might have a difficult time using some of them in a sentence: When are you going to need the negative form of the agent participle of the verb hypellä (to jump around) – hyppelemätön (roughly “not having been jumped around”)? How about the first-person plural imperative present negative form of kammata (to comb) – Älkäämme kammatko (Let us not comb)?<p><p>Still, it’s reassuring to know it’s all there, in case you someday have to express en liene ymmärtänyt (I may possibly not have understood) or en liene saartanut (I may possibly not have blockaded) or en liene kylpenyt (I may possibly not have bathed).<p><p>Finnish noun and adjective endings represent at least 15 different grammatical cases. It’s a great party trick to be able to recite them all – and it’s extremely rare to meet a Finn who can: nominative, accusative, genitive, partitive, inessive, elative, illative, adessive, ablative, allative, essive, translative, abessive, comitative and instructive.<p><p>Despite the large number of cases, Finnish is actually a lot simpler than German or Russian in this respect. Both Russian (six cases) and German (four cases) utilise three grammatical genders, each with its own set of endings, compounding the amount of memorisation. Also, adjectives may use different endings than the nouns they modify, exponentially confusing things. Finnish has no grammatical genders, and adjectives always take the same endings as their associated nouns.<p><p>Guide to Finnish Declension (Finnlibri), a slim volume of diagrams, tables and listings, groups Finnish nouns and adjectives into 42 different patterns (words ending in a double vowel, words ending in “a” or “ä,” and so on). To check a declension, just scan the table of contents for a word that is similar to the one you’re looking for. Does it end in “-nen” like ihminen (person), “-tus” like ajatus (thought) or “-tön” like työtön (unemployed)?<p><p>Dive into declensions: “Uiminen on hauskaa!” (Swimming is fun!) Here we see the Finnish language’s partitive complement in action.Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>In Guide to Finnish Declension and Guide to Finnish Verbs, you’ll run into accounts of consonant gradation, spelling changes that may alter the stem of a word before endings can be added. Kaunis (beautiful) doubles the “i” and drops the “s” in order to add “-lle” and become kauniille (for the beautiful one).<p><p>Consonant gradation forms a sticking point for many non-native Finnish speakers, but rest assured that it’s all very logical and learnable. If three-year-old Finnish kids can master it, so can you. The clearest explanation we know of can be found in Fred Karlsson’s classic Finnish: An Essential Grammar (Routledge), first published in 1983 and still going strong. One of our favourite reference books, it reveals the secrets behind consonant gradation and many other mysteries.<p><p>It systematically covers the language from history to grammar to colloquial speech, categorising and illuminating as it goes. Frequent example sentences show how points of grammar play out in practical usage:<p><p>Uiminen on hauskaa (Swimming is fun) demonstrates a partitive complement in action. Onko sinulla hattu päässä? means “Do you have a hat on your head?” and not “in the head.” If you come to Helsinki yhtenä päivänä viikossa, you’re there one day a week.<p><p>We’ll leave you with a typical Finnish view about a favourite beverage, handily expressed using the past participle passive of juoda (to drink): Monet ihmiset ajattelevat paremmin juotuaan kahvia (Many people think better when they have had some coffee).

In agricultural areas, woodchips are also increasingly used to heat energy-hungry greenhouses and grain-drying silos. Publicity campaigns have meanwhile helped residents find many ways to reduce emissions from their homes. “We’ve found that households can curb their emissions by 20 percent or more by following such advice,” says Seppälä.<p><p>Public funding has been provided to kick-start many of the project’s emission inventories, studies and measures designed to cost-effectively enhance energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. But Seppälä emphasises that local commitment and creativity are crucial.<p><p>Initial estimates suggest that the largest Canemu town, Uusikaupunki on the west coast, may have already curbed its emissions by as much as 20 percent. In one imaginative scheme, local firm Sybimar set up an integrated system combining waste-to-energy, greenhouse cultivation, fish farming and the production of biodiesel fuel. Within this closed system wastes, energy and nutrients are all recycled so as to minimise total material use and emissions.<p><p>Burning small, pellet-shaped woodchips puts a smaller burden on the environment than using fossil fuels.Photo: Pekka Sakki/Lehtikuva<p><p>Seppälä is pleased that other Finnish municipalities have quickly cottoned on to the five pioneer towns’ achievements. “We’re really seeing a snowball effect now!” he says. Five new municipalities have just signed up to join Canemu’s next phase, including Lohja, Raasepori, Hanko and Siuntio – four neighbours with a combined population of almost 100,000 just west of Helsinki. “This will provide a fine showcase for Finnish cleantech expertise,” says Seppälä.<p><p>Municipal measures designed to curb local emissions in the transport, building, farming and food sectors are also likely to snowball. New holiday homes and homes outside built-up areas will be fitted with more solar collectors and air- or ground-source heat pumps. The local authorities will promote remote working (telecommuting), and find ways to save energy and reduce waste in municipal kitchens that cater for schools and hospitals. Wind parks are planned in several locations. Projected electrified rail links will also reduce emissions.<p><p>“It’s vital to remember that most emission-saving schemes also make sense economically,” adds Seppälä. “No miraculous new technologies are needed – there just has to be the will to see climate-friendly actions through.”<p><p>We may soon see more windmills like these, which are located on the Finnish west coast.Photo: Jukka Palm/Vastavalo<p><p>Finland’s environment minister Ville Niinistö praises the Canemu Project as an exemplary form of cooperation between the local authorities, private enterprise and citizens.<p><p>“This model for reducing emissions should be adopted elsewhere, too, since municipalities and their residents make choices every day that can help us build a green economy,” he says.<p><p>Niinistö also emphasises the positive social and economic impacts of such climate-friendly actions: “Through this project municipalities are creating jobs for the future while reducing their emissions.”<p><p>“We’re also now expanding the project’s networking forum and open databank to spread good, practical, climate-friendly ideas within Finland and later internationally,” adds Seppälä. “It helps to take a positive approach, seeing the need to mitigate climate change as an opportunity rather than a problem.”<p><p>By Fran Weaver, April 2013<p><p>Local commitment and creativity<p><p>Snowball effect<p><p>Opportunities from problems<p>", "time": "2015-01-16T08:40:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Companies are also involved, particularly from educational and ICT fields, and EduCluster Finland, an organisation specialised in creating educational excellence, has a significant role.<p><p>Education ambassadors: Project manager Niko Lindholm (left) and project director Eeva Nuutinen of Finpro are involved in exporting educational expertise.Photo: Susanna Alatalo<p><p>“Future Learning Finland was born when a Finnish education export strategy was laid out in 2010,” says Eeva Nuutinen, project director at Finpro. “Finland had done well in PISA, and the objective was to figure out how to commercialise this success. It became evident how much of Finland’s expertise has a lot of market potential.”<p><p>“Three years ago education export as an industry did not exist in Finland. It has been established along with this programme.” Nuutinen points out that while education export is mostly associated with degree sales, this does not apply to Finland, so it has had to take a different approach to education export.<p><p>So what is this expertise, and more importantly, how can it be exported to other countries? Teacher training, and especially vocational education development, form important aspects, along with ICT and public and private degrees. “We don’t exactly export degrees, but we build and tailor educational entities according to different needs,” says Nuutinen. “Educational consulting also takes place. The educational level and needs of a country or region are evaluated, along with how they could be developed.” Physical and virtual learning environments both enter the picture.<p><p>ICT forms one sector that Future Learning Finland seeks to reach when promoting Finnish educational expertise.Photo: Riitta Supperi/Team Finland<p><p>FLF is involved in events including forums, seminars and roadshows. They’re important for identifying and reaching certain segments, such as ICT. Local media helps increase visibility. The traffic is two-way: there are delegations visiting Finland as well as Finnish export promotion trips.<p><p>Nuutinen describes Saudi Arabia as the most important market region for FLF at the moment. A massive reform taking place there comprises significant investments in education. Finland can have a role to play in sharing expertise in education, but also in educational infrastructure. “They want whole schools, for example,” says Nuutinen. “We have architect agencies in Finland that plan schools and construction companies [to build them]. FLF also has member companies that can provide proper furniture and equipment.”<p><p>In addition to the Persian Gulf, Russia, China and possibly Hong Kong are among the regions that interest Finnish education professionals. In February 2013, the annual International Exhibition and Forum for Education (IEFE) took place in Saudi Arabia. It is described by Finpro project manager Niko Lindholm as highly significant in terms of Finnish educational promotion on a large scale. A number of commercial deals were sealed, and Finland enjoyed a highly visible role at the event.<p><p>“When the Saudi Arabians began researching where to seek educational expertise as they began their reform, Finland, Singapore and South Korea turned out to be societies that have most rapidly transformed from manufacturing societies into information societies,” Lindholm says.<p><p>One of the many FLF member companies that took part in IEFE is 10monkeys.com, an e-company in the field of mathematics. Managing director Katri Björklund describes the event as highly successful on their behalf, as they sealed a deal of with a local agent in Saudi Arabia. “As a small company it was great to have the support an organisation like Future Learning Finland, and to have credibility on our side,” Björklund says.<p><p>FLF is set up for three years, after which an evaluation determines whether it continues. “We are in the process of reviewing what Finnish education will look like in 2018,” Nuutinen says. “The industry will hardly have run its course [by then], even if this programme has.” It seems fitting that Future Learning Finland has picked as its motto, “We see brilliant futures.”<p><p>By Annika Rautakoura, April 2013<p><p>Physical and virtual learning<p><p>Rapidly transforming societies<p>", "time": "2013-04-24T08:32:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

There is especially great international interest in the forthcoming dramatisation of Sofi Oksanen’s latest book, When the Doves Disappeared, which runs at the Finnish National Theatre with surtitles from autumn 2013. Oksanen’s previous novel Purge, which started out as a play and was also made into a film, won multiple awards and became one of Finland’s most translated books.<p><p>The iconic National Theatre building was in a New Year’s light show. Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>Eurydice forms the Finnish National Theatre’s first surtitled performance. This popular play by one of America’s leading contemporary playwrights, Sarah Ruhl, gives a modern twist to classical drama by retelling the Greek myth of Orpheus’s journey into the underworld – from his wife’s viewpoint.<p><p>“We’re proud that our production has a great, international team with Russian-American director Yana Ross, who is very well known in Europe; young American designer Zane Pihlstrom creating costumes and set; and Lithuanian composer Antanas Jasenka creating the soundscapes,” says Buchwald, as well as a strong Finnish cast.<p><p>With so much surreal, surprising and sensual action happening on the stage, non-Finnish-speakers watching Eurydice may have trouble keeping one eye on the bilingual surtitles beamed up on the back of the set.

The Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment, a ten-year programme known by its Finnish abbreviation, VELMU, aims to survey marine waters off Finland’s long and intricate coastline all the way from the Gulf of Finland through the beautiful island-dotted Archipelago Sea to the Bothnian Bay in the north.<p><p>Excess nutrients from agricultural fertilisers and other sources form the Baltic Sea’s largest problem, but hazardous chemicals can also be found. It is a shallow sea with a slow rate of water replacement via its one entrance to the Atlantic, the strait between Denmark and Sweden. Accurate information about marine life and seabed conditions in the Baltic Sea is urgently needed to ensure that its natural treasures can be protected.<p><p>“At the moment big gaps still exist in our maps of the ecology and geology of the Finnish waters of the Baltic,” says marine biologist Essi Keskinen, an experienced diver who is currently working on VELMU for Metsähallitus Natural Heritage Services.<p><p>An eelpout seems to make eye contact with the camera. Photo: Mats Westerbom/Metsähallitus<p><p>“Diving for long periods in the Baltic can be hard physical work, especially with lots of heavy breathing gear and sampling equipment,” she says. “When we start diving in the spring after the sea-ice melts, the water temperature’s just two degrees Celsius. But I really love doing fieldwork at sea with other enthusiastic biologists and students. We usually make a base on a remote island where we might camp out for a week while diving in nearby waters.”<p><p>Beneath the waves the divers use pencils and plastic paper pads to note information on water depth, marine life and the ecological and geological features of the sea bed, which might be rocky, sandy, muddy, or covered with lush seaweed growth.<p><p>“We note marine plants, algae and any fish or smaller sea creatures that we see – as well as any pollution we might notice,” Keskinen says. “Unfortunately we find all kinds of rubbish underwater, from vodka bottles to car batteries, and even fridges. But it’s always exciting to explore new waters, and sometimes we find very beautiful underwater ecosystems with clear water and many colourful marine plants.”<p><p>Although some parts of the Baltic can be clouded with algae, there are also areas of clear water and colourful plants.Photo: Mats Westerbom/Metsähallitus<p><p>Finland’s marine waters cover more than 50,000 square kilometres, and are up to 100 metres deep. “We can dive down to about 30 metres, but there isn’t much vegetation below ten or 20 metres because so little light penetrates,” says Keskinen. “Though we make wide use of drop videos and aerial surveys, we can’t possibly survey everywhere, so we use modelling to extrapolate data for areas we can’t visit.”<p><p>The inventory’s findings have resulted in detailed ecological maps of marine habitats in all Finnish waters. This information can be used to designate areas for conservation, or to control fishing, dredging and the locations of marine infrastructure such as pipelines and wind turbines.<p><p>The shallow and sensitive waters of the Baltic Sea have long suffered from pollution. But Keskinen, who has been diving in the Baltic for more than 20 years, is optimistic about the sea’s future prospects: “The situation’s still not good, but I think we’re past the worst of it,” she says. “In the late 1990s and early 2000s, some waters were like a thick porridge of blue-green algae. Measures like the new sewage treatment plants in St Petersburg and a ban on sewage releases from big passenger cruisers are slowly beginning to work.”<p><p>Members of the VELMU team get ready to take the plunge.

We check in on the project.<p><p>It’s eight in the morning at Kannel Daycare in northern Helsinki and the children are lining up for a nutritious breakfast that includes some organic ingredients. Bread, cold cuts, fruit, milk and porridge are on the menu; today the porridge – the all-important mainstay of Finnish children’s breakfast – is organic. The meal forms part of a City of Helsinki initiative, introduced in 2011, that maintains an ambitious target of ensuring that 50 percent of the food served in city preschools and daycares is organic by 2015.<p><p>The project aims to improve public health by encouraging sustainable consumption habits at an early age and creating awareness among children about the source of their food. The teachers make a point of discussing this with the kids. “We always go through the menu with them before breakfast and lunch. If it includes organic macaroni or organic milk, they are aware of that,” says Outi Anttonen-Abdalla, a preschool teacher at Kannel.<p><p>A child at Kannel Daycare drew this picture to thank the cook for a good breakfast.Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>As people become increasingly conscious about the environment and observe various food-sourcing scandals in Europe, most parents are concerned about the nutrition of their kids’ meals.<p><p>Tuuli Rossi, mother of a six-year-old, considers organic and local food the safest bet: “It is usually produced on a smaller scale, probably on a farm close to your home, unlike packaged food, which passes through five or six middlemen before it reaches you. You don’t know what could be in it, and eating organic is one way to prevent that.” The popular sentiment is to find the shortest route from farm to fork. This becomes a matter of finding the right balance between supply and demand.<p><p>In the past two years, Helsinki City Council granted 400,000 euros to preschools to include organic ingredients in their meals. Today the meals include 12 to 15 percent organic ingredients, a proportion that is expected to rise further. But shortage of organic raw materials, inadequate supply chain linkages and rising costs are slowing down the organic food consumption’s pace of growth.<p><p>The teachers go through the menu with the kids to increase awareness about the source of their food.Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>While organic grains, wheat, oats, porridges and pastas are available in abundance, meat, poultry, dairy products, seasonal vegetables and fruits are not. Also, the small package sizes that are available can make organic catering a difficult proposition. “We need large packages of organic ingredients, as we provide food to daycare units with 100 kids or more,” says Aulikki Johansson, director of catering services at Palmia, a company that serves more than 300 daycares and preschools in Helsinki.<p><p>According to Finnish food safety agency Evira, 365 new farms were registered in the organic production control system last year, a massive jump from the previous three years. Organic farming currently accounts for nine percent of the total cultivated area in Finland, and the government intends to push that number to 20 percent by 2020, in a project nicknamed Organic 20/2020.<p><p>This bodes well for the City of Helsinki and its targets – and also for the children in the Finnish capital’s preschools and daycares.<p><p>By Asha Gopalkrishnan, March 2013<p><p>From farm to fork<p><p>Organic farming taking large steps<p>", "time": "2013-03-28T12:48:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Spanish nurses bridge the gap in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/spanish-nurses-bridge-the-gap-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>A number of Spanish nurses, affected by their country’s financial woes, are choosing to apply for positions at Finnish healthcare services. They’re settling in well and are proving adept at bridging the language gap.<p><p>“The problem is not the language,” explains Irene Trigo, a qualified nurse from Haro, Spain. “If you really want to communicate with someone, you do!” In autumn 2012, she moved to Finland from her town in the Rioja region, known for its fine red wine.<p><p>Her colleague Ander Velado, also a qualified nurse, arrived with her and doesn’t think Finnish is such a difficult language. His mother tongue is Basque, spoken in the northern region of Spain.<p><p>“The Basque language also has declensions, like Finnish does,” says Velado. “So in that way, Finnish grammar is actually quite familiar to me.” Northern Spain was the focus for recruiting nurses, since it and Finland share significant aspects related to cultural adjustment: bilingualism and cold winter weather, though the latter is not on the same scale as in Finland.<p><p>Nurses Ander Velado (left) and Irene Trigo were in a celebratory mood after receiving job offers from Finland. Photo courtesy of A. Velado and I. Trigo<p><p>After a long period of unemployment and temporary contracts, Trigo and Velado sent their job applications to Finland, which is experiencing a shortage of qualified nursing staff. They were two of the lucky ones – out of about 2,000 applicants, only around 60 were accepted.<p><p>Before their arrival to Finland they underwent a four-month crash course in Finnish language and culture. “I was studying Finnish 12 hours a week,” says Trigo. “It was quite intense. But the truth is that I didn’t use to know anything about Finland, except that it always achieves high scores in the PISA tests [the global Programme for International Student Assessment].”<p><p>The decision about how to travel to Finland was taken after a couple of beers. “One night at a bar in Bilbao, Irene told me that she was planning to go to Finland by car, and I just said ‘I’ll join you!’” Three thousand kilometres and two ferries later, they were in Finland.<p><p>“The trip was special,” Velado says. “We had four days to think about this big step we were taking. Going to an unknown country makes you think. We felt happy and a bit nervous at the same time.”<p><p>Trigo (left) and Velado are clearly enjoying life in Finland. Photo courtesy of A. Velado and I. Trigo<p><p>Trigo was assigned to work as an auxiliary nurse in an old people’s home in the community of Honkajoki. “Since the very beginning, I was excited about coming to Finland,” Trigo says. “Now I have my own apartment and a job that I enjoy! It’s great!”<p><p>Velado was assigned to the city of Pori, about 60 kilometres from Honkajoki, where he is also working with the elderly. “We are scattered around the country, but I try to keep in contact with the others that live nearby,” Velado explains.<p><p>Initially, all the Spanish nurses are working as auxiliary nurses until they are able to master the language. “We try to speak Finnish to the patients, and if we can’t manage we ask one of the employees for help,” Trigo says. “Both staff and patients are always willing to help – to start with they are shy, but in the end they are very friendly. Obviously we cannot work as nurses yet. I guess it’ll take a year or so.”<p><p>Velado, Trigo and their colleagues continue studying Finnish every week. The idea behind the recruitment of Spanish nurses is to try to ease the shortage of nurses in Finland, especially within elderly care. At the same time it may help alleviate Spain’s pervasive unemployment problem.<p><p>Velado explains that with Spain’s current economic crisis, Finland offers better living conditions, and that salaries for both qualified nurses and auxiliary nurses are higher than in Spain. However, no matter where you come from or where you travel, it always seems like some things are better back home. “I definitely prefer Mediterranean food to Finnish food,” Velado says.<p><p>By Carina Chela, February 2013<p><p>Big step<p><p>Getting settled<p>", "time": "2013-03-01T14:19:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Travelling Finland with a Victorian view - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/travelling-finland-with-a-victorian-view/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Nowadays almost everyone knows something about Finland: Finnish games (Angry Birds, Clash of Clans), ice hockey players (Mikael Granlund, Teemu Selänne), design brands (Marimekko, Iittala) and high-tech companies (Nokia, F-Secure). However, back in the late 1800s, things were quite different.<p><p>Tourism in Finland was very rare indeed, until British author Mrs Alec Tweedie visited the country with her sister. She wrote about their experiences in 1897 in a book called Through Finland in Carts, with a revised edition in 1913.<p><p>When preparing for her northern adventure, Tweedie was not even able to obtain a suitable guidebook or map of Finland. She did hear plenty of inaccurate rumours about the country, including that it was inhabited by barbarians, that polar bears roamed the streets and that people got around in the summer on sledges pulled by reindeer.<p><p>The sisters arrived by steamship in the port of Helsingfors – that’s the name of Helsinki in Finland’s other official language, Swedish, which was more prominent in those days. They found it a charming little town, but were surprised by the heat. They were also impressed that Helsinki was so advanced in using electricity, telephones and bicycles compared to London at that time. They roamed the city and made lots of observations. One of the restaurants Tweedie called delightful, Kapellet, is still popular today, and is now known as Kappeli.<p><p>Mrs Alec Tweedie got the tourism ball rolling in Finland with her 1897 book “Through Finland in Carts.” Photo: Gutenberg Project/TM<p><p>Some things have certainly changed. Modern Finns have a reputation for being on time, but Tweedie stated, “No Finn ever hurried himself for anybody or anything.” She mentioned that Finns were not attractive, small, thickset, had high cheekbones and eyes inherited from their Tartar-Mongolian ancestors (a misconception of that time).<p><p>On the positive side, she said, “they read much and think deeply,” and “both rich and poor are wonderfully well educated.” She also described them as hospitable, generous, honest and kind. Furthermore, women’s rights in Finland, she observed, were more advanced compared to other countries.<p><p>The sisters voyaged by boat to Wiborg (now Vyborg, located in the slice of eastern Finland that was ceded to the Soviet Union during the Second World War) to stay at a country mansion where they discovered the Finnish smorgåsbord and brännvinn (local schnapps).<p><p>Also in the area that now forms part of Russia, they travelled to the original Valamo, located on an island in Lake Ladoga, to see the simple and ascetic life of the Orthodox monks. They attended the Sortavala Festival, in the village of the same name, to learn about Finnish music, especially folk music. They were intrigued by the Finnish national instrument, the kantele. At the same festival they attended a play written by famous playwright Minna Canth, who now has a street named after her in the Helsinki neighbourhood of Töölö.<p><p>Akseli Gallen-Kallela, Finland’s most famous artist, painted this winter view of the magnificent Imatra Rapids around the same time that Mrs Alec Tweedie wrote about them for British readers. Photo: Sari Gustafsson/Lehtikuva<p><p>As for the concept of Finnishness, Tweedie devotes a chapter to the significance and intricacies of the sauna, describing her own experiences with Finnish bathing rituals. Another chapter is dedicated to the national epic, Kalevala. Tweedie not only recounts its history, meaning and societal value, but also quotes several translated sections of the work.<p><p>Perhaps the most entertaining component of the book is the sisters’ journey through the Finnish countryside in uncomfortable, horse-drawn carts. They stayed in peasant lodging, farmhouses, manor houses and even spent nights in Olavinlinna, a castle that is now the home of the renowned Savonlinna Opera Festival. They encountered the wildness of Midsummer’s Eve, viewed the unique beauty of Punkaharju, learned about forestry and tar making, admired the magnificent power of the Imatra Rapids and descended other frightening rapids in a tar transport boat.<p><p>Throughout the journey, they met friendly people who were fascinated by these strange foreign ladies. They sampled the local food – not always enjoyable – endured extremely long hours of primitive travel, encountered strange customs, and yet seemed to keep a good sense of humour throughout the journey.<p><p>Through Finland in Carts does not represent a flawless study of Finnish life at the turn of the century, but rather one writer’s discoveries in a strange, little-known land. An appendix goes into great detail describing Finnish politics at the time.<p><p>So, if you’d like to escape the pressures of modern life for a while, get hold of this book (online booksellers list several modern reprints, and a Project Gutenberg ebook is available free) and return to a simpler, quainter Finland.<p><p>By Russell Snyder, February 2013<p><p>Finland now and then<p><p>An outside view of Finnish culture<p>", "time": "2013-02-18T15:23:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Sledding the city slopes in style - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/sledding-the-city-slopes-in-style/", "review": "", "content": "<p>An unusually snowy winter in Helsinki sets the stage for a favourite winter pastime: sledding. Here’s how to get the most out of your journey down the urban slopes.<p><p>Helsinki inhabitants, who usually spend much of their winters shaking their heads at forecasts of slush and sleet, have recently seen their hometown cast into a tourist-brochure winter. During what has been the snowiest Helsinki winter in 27 years, newspapers have run photos of locals skiing next to trams in the city centre and the Rescue Department has asked citizens to provide plowing help.<p><p>The seemingly endless heaps of snow are a source of stress during morning commutes, but they also turn the city into a downy, almost surreal playground on weekends: Dog-walkers, cross-country skiers and ice fishing enthusiasts take to the frozen sea and many others visit the city’s parks, whose snow-covered hills serve as perfect sledding slopes.<p><p>Keep your feet off the ground as you slide on the slope. Photo: Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva<p><p>The hills of parks such as Kaivopuisto, Central Park, Sinebrychoff Park and Kaisaniemi Park become speckled with sleds ranging from red to neon green. You can see everything from steerable Stigas to small, round, one-person sleds that are little more than small sheets of plastic with single handles – known as liukurit, sliders, in Finnish).<p><p>Shrovetide (Laskiainen in Finnish), a February holiday signifying the start of Lent in the Christian tradition, is connected with Shrove Tuesday, which – curiously enough – is devoted to sledding in Finland. And while many of us might deem sliding down a hill on a plastic tray an activity best practiced by children, the weather hasn’t been this conducive to a traditional, sledding-oriented Shrove Tuesday in years.<p><p>If sales figures offer any indication, people are heading to the hills in throngs: Finnish plastic products manufacturer Orthex, for example, has sold 50 percent more sleds this year than last.<p><p>Whether you’re a first-timer or you’re making a long-awaited return to the city slopes, here are a few things to keep in mind.<p><p>Wear the right clothes: Even if your pea coat is able to withstand a few trips down the hill, your jeans won’t. Dress for sledding like you would dress for the ski slopes, prepared to have snow push its way into your gloves and up your legs.<p><p>Sledding will give you an adrenaline rush, even if it doesn’t match winning gold in Vancouver like Felix Loch. Photo: Clive Mason/AFP/LK<p><p>Test out different models: A bulky, square-shaped plastic sled (ahkio) offers a steadier experience than a liukuri, which requires the user to hold his or her legs up in order to avoid a violent spray of snow in the face. A steerable Stiga sled, meanwhile, offers a larger degree of control (it even has brakes), but isn’t built for an adult frame and can easily tip over.<p><p>Practice your technique: Although sledding is pretty self-explanatory, maintaining balance at high speeds can be more difficult than it looks. Don’t let your feet dangle; keep them inside the sled or lifted off the ground. Cramming two passengers into one sled can actually ease the process, evening the weight of the sled and grounding it.<p><p>Prepare to get wet and tired: It may seem obvious, but for every breezy ride down the hill, there is also the mandatory climb up in deep, slippery snow. Also, keep in mind the first rule of sliding etiquette, if only to not look foolish in front of the kids: Go off to the side before climbing back up the hill, rather than ascending through the middle where you are in danger from sleds travelling at high speeds.<p><p>Treat yourself: Since sledding tends to result in soggy clothes and physical weariness, you’ll appreciate a close proximity to a café where you can warm up afterwards. At Sinebrychoff Park, for example, you can slide almost right up to the entrance of Fanny Café, while the slopes at Kaivopuisto are only a stone’s throw away from seaside Café Ursula. And after a few treks up the hill, a laskiaispulla (a Shrovetide pastry filled with marzipan or jam and whipped cream) will hardly feel like a vice.<p><p>By Laura Palotie, February 2010<p><p>Shrovetide tradition<p><p>Practical tips<p>", "time": "2013-02-07T14:25:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

I’m convinced that the Sámi have a lot to learn from indigenous peoples in North America, New Zealand and elsewhere.<p><p>One of the few times the Sámi have enjoyed success in the Finnish courts was when Utsjoki municipality in northern Finland abandoned its plan for a plant that would bottle water from the sacred Sámi spring of Suttesája (Sulaoja in Finnish) about six years ago.<p><p><p><p>What does “decolonisation” of Sámi society mean?<p><p>One thing it refers to is the creation of institutions and services that better reflect Sámi values within education, healthcare, social services and politics. If possible, they can be grounded on principles derived from Sámi institutions that may have existed previously, usually informal ones.<p><p>This is not a “return to the past”. It’s about finding ways to employ “traditional” principles and values when establishing present-day institutions. In some areas, such as Sámi education and social services, this is already happening.<p><p><p><p>What’s at the top of your concerns about relations between Finland and the Sámi?<p><p>Finnish human rights policy has been characterised by double standards for the past two decades. Despite maintaining an international image as a defender of human rights, Finland has been deploying delay tactics and unfounded promises since at least 1990 when the Committee on Sámi Issues submitted a proposal for the Sámi Act to the government.<p><p>The Finnish Constitution has recognised the Sámi as an indigenous people and confirmed the Sámi linguistic and cultural rights. Finland was one of 142 countries to adopt the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. When will this translate into political will and legal measures?<p><p><p><p>What improvements have you seen in the situation of Sámi people in recent years?<p><p>Norway has been most progressive and active in recognising and promoting Sámi rights since the 1980s. For instance, the Finnmark Act of 2005 recognises Sámi land and water rights and ensures comanagement of resources.<p><p>When I was going to school in Utsjoki, the Sámi identity and language were still stigmatised. Thanks to the long-term efforts of Sámi cultural workers, writers, politicians and others, young parents realised that it’s up to them to ensure the survival of the Sámi language by speaking it to their children. The status of the Northern Sámi language, spoken in northern Finland, Norway and Sweden, is stronger than it used to be – though still not secure.<p><p>By Peter Marten, February 2009, updated February 2013<p>", "time": "2013-02-04T13:10:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Chef Sami Tallberg urges people to fearlessly season their everyday lives with the tastes of the wild.<p><p>On a brisk, breezy subzero day at Helsinki’s Market Square, wild food chef Sami Tallberg admires a big burbot from the Porvoo Archipelago.<p><p>He points to its frosty innards and says: “Who needs foie gras? You can make great paté in the same way from this fat liver.”<p><p>As Finland’s best-known champion of wild food, Tallberg has been urging people to taste off-the-beaten track foods from nature. In books, TV shows and world travels with government ministers, he’s been sharing his enthusiasm for nature’s powerful superfoods. Rich in flavours, nutrition and colour, these free foods rate highly in any ecological or ethical comparison.<p><p>Wood sorrel is one edible plant that can be foraged in the forests of Finland.Photo: Jouko Lehmuskallio/NatureGate<p><p>“Whenever possible, I use sustainably harvested wild foods and always try to use as many parts of the plant or animal as possible,” says Tallberg. “If there’s something that’s not available domestically, like shellfish, I prefer to use Nordic stuff to limit the carbon ‘foodprint.’ I’m a bit idealistic about this.”<p><p>Tallberg was bitten by the wild-food bug a decade ago while working at a restaurant in London:<p><p>“One day this forager, Miles Irving, came in to offer us some sea kale, which is kind of like broccoli, an extremely delicious and noble plant. He kept bringing me other plants and herbs. They were challenging – I didn’t know what to do with them at first. He asked me and some other chefs for ideas for his book, and took me foraging in Kent. I began to realise the possibilities of things like wild fennel and watercress. It really broadened my spectrum.”<p><p>After returning to Finland five years ago, Tallberg began tasting plants, mushrooms, berries, mosses and lichens in the forest. Soon he was replacing parsley with ground elder and Italian arugula with wild yellow rocketcress, and inventing uses for nettles and spruce shoots.<p><p>Sami Tallberg has written or contributed to a number of books about wild food, including “Koivunmahlaa &amp; Kaviaaria” (Birch Sap and Caviar). Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>He stresses the importance of carefully identifying everything, recommending the NatureGate website and app, which include clear photos of Finnish species with their names in eight languages. This is especially important with mushrooms, of course.<p><p>Teaming up with hunters and fishermen, he began exploring elk, venison, fowl and fish: “Sea pike is so beautiful, clean and versatile. Most people prefer small ones, but the big ones taste great and are easier to bone. You can eat them raw as sashimi or as ceviche with vinegar.”<p><p>Tallberg has spread the gospel of wild food at Helsinki’s prestigious Carelia and Kämp restaurants and in his books: the bilingual Wild Herb Cookbook and Koivunmahlaa &amp; Kaviaaria (Birch Sap and Caviar). He also supplied recipes for another book, Mäti (Roe). In spring 2013 he was on Finland’s Top Chef TV show judging wild food dishes.<p><p>Tallberg’s books are available at the Eat &amp; Joy Farmers’ Market in Helsinki, which sells berries, mushrooms and herbs all year round, dried, frozen or in jams, juices and teas. In summer and autumn, traditional Finnish markets sell a wealth of berries and mushrooms, with fish available all year round.<p><p>What about wild food pharmacy? The chaga mushroom can be dried, ground and used to brew a tea that some believe has medicinal properties. Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>At Finnish markets, you can buy boletus mushrooms, which are popular with Italians, who import them and come to Finland on mushroom-picking trips. Meanwhile wild lingonberries and blueberries – which help prevent cardiovascular disease and yield other health benefits – have proven a hit with visitors from Japan and China.<p><p>Finnish wild foods have been boosted by high-profile events such as the Cook it Raw gathering of top chefs, held in Lapland in 2010, and by active support from Alexander Stubb, who was Minister for Foreign Trade between 2011 to 2014 and took Tallberg along to showcase wild food in countries all over the world.<p><p>“We hope [promotional efforts] will help advance the growing interest in Finnish wild food, sparked by our four distinct seasons that offer very special growing conditions,” says Sari Mattila, executive director of the Foundation for the Promotion of Finnish Food Culture.<p><p>She was part of the team behind chef Mika Palonen, who represented Finland with a Finnish wild food theme at the world chefs’ competition Bocuse d’Or in January 2013 in France. Palonen conjures up dishes featuring deep-fried lichen, lingonberries, juniper, boletus mushrooms – and some wild rose petals donated by Tallberg.<p><p>“It’s great to see this spreading,” says Tallberg. “It’s becoming a national movement.”<p><p>By Wif Stenger, January 2013, updated November 2017<p><p>Carbon foodprint<p><p>Wild food gospel<p><p>Growing into a movement<p>", "time": "2013-02-01T07:31:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

You might just end up working in Finland’s cutting-edge mobile game industry.<p><p>When Wensi Zhai got hold of her first book about Finland, she was an undergraduate student at China Central Academy of Fine Art. At that moment she knew exactly where she wanted to go.<p><p>“The book impressed me,” explains Zhai. After reading the book, she began hunting for possibilities to move to Finland. “The pictures showed designs that I felt attracted to. I wanted to know more about Finnish design, and about the country’s lifestyle and natural environment. When I like something I can be blind to other things.”<p><p>Zhai’s friend and colleague, Miguel Moreno from Spain, tells a different story that is nonetheless familiar. Moreno’s first visits to Finland involved “a blonde lady with green eyes,” but he soon fell in love with the minimalistic shapes of Finnish design and art, too.<p><p>“I can’t understand how designers like Eero Aarnio or architects like Alvar Aalto or Eero Saarinen aren’t better known outside of Finland,” says Moreno. He soon started sending CVs to Finland and eventually closed the doors of his animation company in Barcelona.<p><p>Pigs will get up to mischief. The game Bad Piggies developed as an offshoot of Angry Birds. Photo: © Rovio<p><p>Zhai achieved her goal in 2008 when she was accepted as an exchange student at Helsinki University of Art and Design, currently part of Aalto University. Today both Zhai and Moreno work at Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish mobile game developer and entertainment company responsible for Angry Birds and Bad Piggies. Zhai holds the position of junior graphic designer and Moreno works as lead character designer.<p><p>“Finland is an ideal country for professionals, especially within the fields of new technology and image,” explains Moreno, who started working at Rovio before the birds hit the big time and the company became a feathery franchise. “It’s a country for enterprising.”<p><p>As a company, Rovio is known for its high employee satisfaction, which they endorse by offering their employees freedom to be innovative. “The fact that I’m offered the possibility to work in different fields – from designing new characters to marketing and also creating ideas for new games – is fantastic,” Moreno says. “And on top of that, I get paid for it!”<p><p>For Zhai, the key is the working environment and the fact that in Finland “designers are really well respected by both clients and colleagues, and design in general is of a very high quality.” In a field where the designer has to “please the client,” respect plays a vital role. Currently Zhai is designing a book for Rovio.<p><p>Movie-themed games are sometimes shunned by gamers, but if you’re playing the wildly popular Angry Birds Star Wars, may the Birds be with you. Photo: © Rovio<p><p>Zhai explains how important design is for her and where she gets her inspiration: “In Finland design is embedded in almost every object – a coffee cup in a cafeteria, a lamp in a restaurant. I can see this and it inspires me. Because of this I feel I can be more creative, outside the office as well as at work.”<p><p>In some Finnish brands, Zhai says, colour design “is not only colourful but at the same time very calm.” Marimekko has kept its Finnishness while also attracting international followers. “That’s good design.”<p><p>She is also inspired by the Finns themselves: “In Finland there is a sense of reliability. Most people are quite serious about their work and about responsibility. I like the straightforwardness of Finns – it makes work easier.”<p><p>The equally enthusiastic Moreno relies on the inspiration he gets from his colleagues: “At Rovio I have the luxury of working with fantastic artists and that nurtures me every day!<p><p>What else is expected in a company infused with talented animation and game designers, all excited about what they are doing? Even their movie-related games – a genre sometimes shunned by gamers – continue the success story, as seen by the way Angry Birds Star Wars has taken off.<p><p>With pigs and birds popping up at an astonishing speed, it’ll be interesting to see what Rovio’s employee count totals a year into the future. The company is on its way to becoming a real empire, and recently announced its first 3D feature film, to be released in summer 2016. It will be produced by John Cohen, whose previous productions include Despicable Me.<p><p>All we’ve got to say is: May the Birds be with you.<p><p>By Carina Chela, December 2012<p><p>Working with piggies and birdies<p><p>Inspired by people<p>", "time": "2013-01-23T06:53:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Finnish rye-bread revolution hits the US - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-rye-bread-revolution-hits-the-us/", "review": "", "content": "<p>At barely 19 years of age, Simo Kuusisto left his home in the northern Finnish town of Oulu to explore the world. He never imagined he would end up baking rye bread for New Yorkers and carrying out a “ryevolution” in the US.<p><p>Kuusisto started baking rye bread purely out of self-interest. “I got rye bread only when my friends and family visited me, I had to satisfy my own needs! So I started baking,” explains Kuusisto while he shoves bread into the oven at Long Island City’s Artisan Baking Centre, a community kitchen for baking entrepreneurs in Queens, New York.<p><p>After moving to New York, Kuusisto attended the renowned French Culinary Institute. Shortly thereafter, he began baking and selling his bread at a weekend farmer’s market. Word spread and people started inquiring about the “dark and chewy bread.” When he realised nobody else was selling rye bread, Kuusisto’s idea for a business plan was obvious.<p><p>Kuusisto is currently the executive chef at the Canadian permanent mission to the UN. He and his brother Tuomas run the family company Nordic Breads on the side, and the baking happens mainly at night. Nordic Breads bakes an average of 10,000 loaves of rye bread every week. Kuusisto has become a rye-bread ambassador, and has managed to convert numerous New Yorkers.<p><p>Mouthwatering organic loaves await customers. Finnish Ruis Bread/flickr, cc by 2.0<p><p>Nordic Breads uses 100% percent organic rye flour from Farmer Ground Flour, a farmer’s cooperative that produces “just the right type of rye flour.” But it wasn’t just the flour; he also needed the right type of sourdough starter. So he flew to Finland and brought back a container of the traditional Finnish sourdough starter needed for the preparation method of rye bread.<p><p>Perhaps the biggest applause goes to Kuusisto’s grandmother. “The recipe I use is based on my grandmother’s own recipe,” Kuusisto says proudly. “She was from Tornio [even farther north than Oulu]. So thanks to my grandma, New Yorkers are eating healthier bread!”<p><p>The label Nordic Breads markets its organic Finnish Ruis Bread (ruis is the Finnish word for “rye”) by emphasising that the product is a superfood: its high fibre content, antioxidants and essential nutrients such as magnesium all convey health benefits.<p><p>“When people realise it’s not just healthy bread but it’s also delicious, they go ballistic and just want more!” According to Kuusisto people immediately taste the difference between his bread and other local rye bread in which “wheat flour is often mixed in or the bread is coloured with molasses or caramel colouring.” For Kuusisto feelings also form a vital ingredient in perfect bread: “I’m baking with my heart; I like to see people happy when they taste my bread.”<p><p>Simo Kuusisto (right) and a helper transfer a fresh batch of rye bread to trays at the Artisan Baking Centre in Queens, New York. Photo: Finnish Ruis Bread/flickr, cc by 2.0<p><p>Finns have always loved their rye bread, and rye represents one of the cores of Finnish culinary culture. The grain is easy to grow, since it tolerates both droughts and cold, and the bread has always been easy to store, even in the olden days. The flat, round loaves, each with a hole in the middle, used to be hung on a stick for storage, and the shape persists to this day.<p><p>“For me rye bread brings back memories from my childhood. I think I’ve been eating rye bread since the age of three!” concludes Kuusisto, whose slogan for Nordic Breads is “Start your ryevolution today!”<p><p>Organic Finnish Ruis Bread can be found in places such as New Amsterdam Market or Whole Foods in New York, or it can be ordered directly from Nordic Breads.<p><p>By Carina Chela, December 2012<p><p>Rye flour power<p><p>The Finnish rye affair<p>", "time": "2014-01-07T14:16:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "How to survive winter in Finland and enjoy it - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/how-to-survive-winter-in-finland-and-enjoy-it/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The arrival of the cold, dark, snowy winter doesn’t mean life stops. On the contrary, discover how Finns not only survive it, but enjoy it!<p><p>Finland is one of the northernmost areas in the world with a permanent population. Winter in Finland varies in duration from about three to seven months, depending on the part of the country, but regardless of location, it’s cold, dark and snowy. But those features don’t disrupt life. Finns will get to work or school in the morning no matter how cold it is or how much snow has fallen.<p><p>They know how to make the most of the winter months. The following Winter Top 8 will give you a glimpse of what keeps Finns going during the coldest months of the year.<p><p>A cinnamon-sprinkled cappuccino chases the winter chill away.Photo: Rodeo.fi/Juha Tuomi<p><p>Coffee gets you moving on cold, dark winter mornings. It provides strength to last the day, and some people even say it helps them get to sleep, believe it or not. Statistics show that coffee consumption per capita in Finland was 11.92 kilograms (in 2009), approximately 3.8 cups of coffee a day (compare to 4.09 kilograms per person in the USA, or 7.35 kilograms in Sweden). The brew that most Finns drink is light-roasted and slightly bitterer than that coffee on the Continent.<p><p>Serving coffee is an important Finnish custom. Most family celebrations, special occasions at the workplace, receptions for sports personalities and visits by friends include a table set with beautiful coffee cups and pastries. But Finns drink coffee anywhere and everywhere – any excuse will do to get their hands on that coffee cup. A fairly recent addition to the urban scene are American-style coffee chains that have quickly attracted a broad clientele.<p><p>Other hot drinks, tea, cocoa, hot blackcurrant juice and ‘glögi’, a Nordic version of mulled wine, are also popular with Finns in the winter.<p><p>Nothing makes you feel more alive or refreshed than a dip in icy waters after roasting in the sauna!© Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Sauna (or the sauna) is an icon of Finnishness, and no wonder. There are at least two million saunas in this country of approximately 5.4 million people and 2.6 million residential properties. The number is rising as most new apartments have an electric sauna adjacent to the bathroom.<p><p>Finns have a sauna to round off an evening, after sports, after sweaty work, in the name of friendship and togetherness, to mark the end of negotiations or just because it’s sauna day, if nothing else. The sauna is a natural part of big days such as Christmas and Midsummer. Contrary to foreign belief, people don’t compete about who can stand the heat of the sauna best, or who can stay in the hot room the longest. They consider a temperature of approximately 80 degrees Celsius to be sensible.<p><p>In winter, the sauna is a great place for warming up frozen fingers and toes. It is a place for relaxation, tranquillity and deep thought. The sauna experience includes escape from the tensions of everyday life to another reality, towards calm and contentment. Some say that having a dip in a hole in the ice of a lake or the sea is one of the joys of a waterside sauna in winter. It will certainly improve your circulation, and at the very least, make you feel refreshingly alive!<p><p>Triple-glazed windows ensure that temperatures inside remain warm even when temperatures outside plummet.Photo: Rodeo.fi/Tuomas Marttila<p><p>A warm house makes all the difference when it is -20 degrees outside. The development of building technology that saves energy and makes use of renewable natural resources has been emphasised in Finland. Building regulations state that windows in new buildings must be triple-glazed, and the latest technology enables window panes to function as solar panels. Draught-proofing and a layer of insulation material at least ten centimetres thick are incorporated into the external walls of houses.<p><p>Various heating options are available, but district heating is an effective, economical and environmentally friendly way to heat a large number of properties. It saves about 30 percent of energy compared with separate production of heat and electricity. This form of heating is produced in power stations which cogenerate heat and electricity. This heat is transferred to water, which then circulates through a network of pipes to radiators in homes before returning to the power station for reheating and recycling.<p><p>Engine-block heaters help cars start smoothly and quickly even in the worst winter chill.Photo: Rodeo.fi/Tero Sivula<p><p>Finns drive in winter almost as much as they do in summer, but special accessories are required when driving in low temperatures and on icy roads.<p><p>All Finnish car owners are required by law to equip their cars with winter tyres, which can either be all-weather tyres, or studded tyres. Drivers have to be on the alert as soon as the weather turns wintry. Visibility deteriorates, roads are slippery, braking distances are longer and driving in deep snow gives drivers less control over their vehicle.<p><p>An engine-block electric heater makes cars easier to start and reduces fuel consumption, and is a great boon for winter drivers who do not have a garage and leave their cars outside overnight. It is a common sight to see drivers plugging their cars into electric sockets in the parking areas outside their homes when they come home from work. Built-in seat heaters are standard in cars manufactured for the Nordic countries and are a feature that drivers in these latitudes really appreciate.<p><p>It’s heavier than it looks, but he’s still smiling!Photo: Rodeo.fi/Juha Tuomi<p><p>The northern parts of Finland are, on average, covered with snow as early as the end of October, while the southern parts are covered starting sometime between December and January. The snow usually doesn’t melt until well into March in the south, and in the northernmost parts of Lapland it can still be lying around in June. Finland knows how to cope with snowstorms and low temperatures.<p><p>Road maintenance is regulated by law in Finland. Individual landowners and local authorities share responsibility for the upkeep of roads. Local authorities make sure that snowploughs are at the ready when roads need to be cleared and when salt and grit spreaders have to be called out to tackle slippery roads.<p><p>Rural Finland is sparsely populated and there are long stretches of road maintained by private individuals who own the adjoining land, or by cooperatives that are responsible for sections of the road. Reflector poles serve as markers that indicate to snowplough drivers and other road users where the edge of the road is even in the heaviest of snowstorms.<p><p>Sledding is a matter of attitude, just like winter! You’d best sit back and enjoy the ride!Photo: Rodeo.fi/Juha Tuomi<p><p>What a fantastic feeling to wake up one morning in the late autumn and look out of the window to see that the first snow has fallen! Children waste no time rushing outside to make their first snowmen and find the nearest sledging hill, while adults dig out their winter sports equipment.<p><p>Cross-country skiing is a national pastime and nearly all municipalities maintain ski tracks that are lit at night. The yearly Finlandia skiing marathon attracts more than 5,000 participants for its 60-kilometre course. Also, schools close for a one-week ski holiday in February or March and many parents take time off then so that families can enjoy outdoor winter pursuits together.<p><p>Other key sports are the various branches of alpine skiing, snowboarding and freestyle skiing. The latter are relatively new sports but they have rapidly become big favourites among the young and daring. Ice skating is another national pastime, like cross-country skiing. Local authorities maintain outdoor skating rinks on school sports fields and other suitably large, flat areas. Indoor ice rinks all over the country serve individual skaters and clubs, but also hockey teams – ice hockey is the biggest spectator sport.<p><p>Messing around in the snow is no problem in coveralls!Photo: Rodeo.fi/Mika Heittola<p><p>The secret to spending time outdoors in the winter is to make sure you are dressed properly. First of all, you must have a comfortable under-layer that draws perspiration away from the skin. Materials that transfer moisture to the outer layers of clothing but keep the warmth in and the skin dry are available in sports shops and department stores. Put another layer of warm clothing on top of this: fleece, cotton or wool is good material for this. The third or outer layer should be a garment that is windproof and waterproof but breathable, and, depending on the degree of cold, padded or quilted.<p><p>Special attention must be paid to protecting the feet, hands and head from the cold. First put on socks which draw moisture away from the skin and do not chafe, then some wool socks and finally comfortable, properly insulated winter footwear with non-slip soles. Nothing will ruin the fun of outdoor activities faster than frozen feet. Gloves should be roomy with a warm lining. Headgear should protect the ears properly, and in very cold weather a silk balaclava is excellent for protecting the face.<p><p>Remember the Finnish saying: “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.”<p><p>Contrary to what foreigners may imagine about dark winter evenings, there is an array of activity options when the work day is over. For avid learners, the extensive library network supports the national reading habit. There are also 250 publicly owned community colleges and adult education centres across the country that offer all kinds of courses at a reasonable price: languages, handicraft, social studies, art, sports – anything that is popular or relevant and interests people. These voluntary educational centres have long traditions and attract approximately 800,000 participants every year.<p><p>Winter’s most popular spectator sport is full of action and close calls.Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>Finns join associations that improve the quality of life in their home district and in the world in numerous ways: through sporting activities, learning about other cultures, dealing with local issues, carrying out international development projects, bringing the interests of children, the elderly and the disabled to the fore and, most importantly, mixing with like-minded people. There are about 123,000 registered associations and statistically every Finn is a member of more than one of them.<p><p>Cultural pursuits and sports have a big following. Every self-respecting town has a theatre and a significant number also have their own orchestra, and waiting lists for the most popular performances are often months long. The menu of indoor sports is long and varied, but ice hockey attracts the biggest crowds on winter evenings. So whether it is staying home with a good book, learning Portuguese or supporting their favourite hockey team, Finns have plenty of ways to enjoy the winter season.<p><p>By Salla Korpela<p><p>Coffee<p><p>Sauna<p><p>Warm housing<p><p>Driving in winter<p><p>Snow: How to get rid of it<p><p>Snow: How to enjoy it<p><p>Proper attire<p><p>Joys of winter evenings<p>", "time": "2014-12-15T08:10:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

According to Sirpa Jalkanen, headmistress of Itäkeskus Upper Secondary School in eastern Helsinki, peace education and conflict prevention are core ideas that define the school’s entire operational culture.<p><p>“The good atmosphere here is based on the principle that every pupil in our school has equal worth,” Jalkanen says.<p><p>There are some 580 students between the ages of 15 and 19 at the school. This city-run school teaches a general academic curriculum as well as one with a focus on languages. Youngsters apply to attend based on their comprehensive school diploma. As at all Finnish secondary schools, tuition is free.<p><p>Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari (right) shares a laugh with fellow Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and philosopher Pekka Himanen at a recent conference in Finland.Photo: Sari Gustafsson/Lehtikuva<p><p>The school aims to prevent conflicts by ensuring equal, safe conditions for all members of the school community. Students and teachers relate to each other in a warm, open manner, evaluation of schoolwork and success is transparent, and established procedures exist for cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents. Education is discussion-based, with pupils encouraged to express themselves. The staff helps youngsters discover and develop their own talents, but also supports those who have trouble learning.<p><p>“This kind of basic attitude curtails tensions and competition between pupils, which in turn helps to prevent conflict-prone situations,” says Jalkanen.<p><p>The school looks after the pupils’ overall wellbeing and balanced growth, with support from the school psychologist, a social worker and a committee of support personnel, teachers and administrators that meets regularly. The school has also drawn up an equality plan.<p><p>“On a regular basis, we carry out an anonymous survey directed at every member of the school community to find out how well we’ve succeeded in executing our plan,” she explains.<p><p>The school community has also agreed on a bullying-prevention model and a crisis management plan, which is discussed annually by pupils in groups. There is immediate intervention when bullying is reported. Conscious attention is also paid to equal treatment regardless of gender or sexual orientation.<p><p>The teenagers we talked to at Itäkeskus Upper Secondary School, like many of their peers across Finland, aim to ace the matriculation exams and gain the honour of wearing the traditional white-and-black Finnish graduation cap.Photo: Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva<p><p>About 20 percent of the school’s students are not native-born Finns. Along with Finnish, they speak 26 other native languages. Regardless of their backgrounds and native tongues, these youngsters have the same goal: to ace the matriculation examination and graduate as university-bound students.<p><p>The pupils’ multiculturalism and variety of backgrounds are considered a source of enrichment here. Around the time of Ahtisaari Day in November, the school observes Language Week, when the students introduce others to their native languages and cultures.<p><p>“As the pupils experience different cultures in their own day-to-day surroundings, this leads to amusing and useful discussions in our language classes, for instance, about national stereotypes,” says Heidi Kohi, who teaches Italian and English. History and social studies classes are also enriched by pupils’ experiences.<p><p>“Internationalism has become such a part of everyday life in Helsinki that young people nowadays don’t even worry about [issues of race],” Jalkanen notes.<p><p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has gained a global reputation as a mediator in conflicts between peoples. As he sees it, peace is a process that requires the broadest possible participation among all parties involved.<p><p>“Mediation does not take place at a state-leader level alone,” says Ahtisaari. “The execution of peace solutions requires contribution of entire societies and cooperation and partnership between various actors.”<p><p>This is the basic idea behind Ahtisaari Day observations at schools. Crisis Management Initiative, the nongovernmental organisation established by the former president, offers schools Ahtisaari Day materials, including mediation exercises, videos and guest speakers, depending on the schools’ wishes. Schools and classes can choose mediators from among their own ranks. Ahtisaari himself always visits several Finnish schools.<p><p>Ahtisaari Day is also celebrated at internet-based schools around the world during the first week of November. Environment Online (ENO) is a global, web-based school system that advances the teaching of sustainable development. ENO, which is based in Joensuu, has had a project lasting more than five years that aims to plant 100 million trees by the year 2017, when Finland celebrates 100 years of independence. More than 10,000 schools in 150 countries take part in ENO activities.<p><p>By Salla Korpela, November 2012, updated November 2016<p><p> <p><p>Spirit of fair play<p><p>International education in the corridors<p><p>Ahtisaari as a role model<p>", "time": "2012-11-08T09:46:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

This culinary centre for Åland has an idyllic setting beside the medieval Kastelholm Castle and the picturesque outdoor museum Jan Karlsgården, which celebrates local rural building styles.<p><p>“At Smakby we want to celebrate Åland’s culinary traditions, which are a bit different from elsewhere in Finland, with more influences from Sweden and from Russia,” Björklund says. “I want my kids and their generation to learn the old ways to make food, so they can enjoy the tastes and smells I remember from my childhood.”<p><p>Photo courtesy of mickesmat.ax<p><p>“Åland has fertile soils that formed on the sea bottom,” Björklund continues. “Our climate is also a bit different, with a cool spring but a long mild autumn, so vegetables like potatoes and asparagus and fruits like apples, strawberries and buckthorn grow slowly, concentrating the taste wonderfully!”<p><p>The restaurant at Jan Karlsgården already serves home cooking featuring taste-packed local ingredients, but Björklund enthusiastically explains his ambitious plans to expand Smakby into an artisanal complex that will be both a tourist attraction and an educational facility – with a seasonal hotel doubling as accommodation for student chefs.<p><p>“We already have plans to start making honey and producing the local apple brandy Ålvados here,” says Björklund. He is also collaborating with the local cooperative dairy ÅCA in order to produce specialist cheeses, butter and ice cream at Smakby. “We’ll then start making organic Åland sausages and traditional smoked ham – and revive local fish dishes like golden smoked Baltic herring and locally caught zander.”<p><p>Björklund is pleased that Åland farmers are increasingly going organic: “There are many small producers here – which is great for chefs like me interested in quality more than quantity. Small is beautiful!”<p><p>Åland provides many food and drink products to mainland Finland – including tangy cheeses, creamy butter, potato snacks, dark Åland malt-bread, and scrumptious cloudy apple juice.<p><p>Photo: Maria Häggblom/Visit Åland<p><p>Åland microbrewery Stallhagen is also increasingly exporting a range of tasty ales produced applying Czech and German techniques in a charming country location 15 kilometres north of Åland’s capital Mariehamn.<p><p>“We’re proud of our concept of ‘slow beer,’ which involves giving fermenting beer much more time to develop its taste, unlike most of today’s industrially mass-produced beers,” says Christian Ekström, who manages Stallhagen brewery’s gastropub.<p><p>“We’re more interested in quality than volume, and we also want people to take time to savour our beer, together with good food and the cultural events we organise here,” adds Ekström. Local fish, game and lamb dishes feature on the menu of the rustic Pub Stallhagen, which is becoming increasingly popular among islanders and tourists.<p><p>Ekström’s own favourite brews include Stallhagen’s Czech-style pilsner and a smoky Baltic porter produced according to an old local recipe. A diver in his free time, Ekström recently recovered several bottles of nearly 200-year-old beer and champagne from a Baltic shipwreck. Experts are currently analysing the bottles’ contents, and Ekström hopes to recreate the tastes that people around the Baltic enjoyed in the early 19th century.<p><p>His dream very much reflects the Åland islanders’ rediscovery of the joys of local food and drink.<p><p>This deliciously filling local snack and dessert is popular in homes and cafés throughout the Åland Islands – especially with cycling tourists keen to recharge their calorie count.

The Finnish multipurpose pollution response vessel Louhi practises firefighting by spraying water over a target boat, as a Finnish Air Force helicopter buzzes past above them, overseeing the action.<p><p>The annual Balex Delta oil-spill response exercises, coordinated by HELCOM (the Helsinki-based international Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission) are among the largest worldwide.<p><p>“About 250 million tonnes of oil are transported through the Baltic every year, mainly from the Russian end of the Gulf of Finland, and these figures are rising fast,” says Bernt Stedt of HELCOM. “It’s vital for the coastal countries to maintain a joint rapid oil-spill response capacity, so we run exercises for our international HELCOM fleet of 70 response vessels to test procedures and identify scope for improvement.”<p><p>In addition to booms that can be lowered into the water, the Finnish vessel “Louhi” contains brush-rollers and other specialised equipment for containing and removing oil spills.Photo: Kati Tahvonen/SYKE<p><p>Each year one of the members of HELCOM – the countries around the Baltic Sea – host the Balex Delta exercise. When Finland last hosted the exercise involved a simulated 15,000-tonne oil spill in a high-risk zone in the Gulf of Finland, where passenger ferries and freighters shuttling between Helsinki and Tallinn cross the courses of oil tankers heading west from Russian ports. In parts of the exercise peat was spilt into the sea to simulate oil slicks. Popcorn was previously used in such trials, but it tended to be gobbled up too quickly by hungry seagulls.<p><p>Finland’s participation is led by the Finnish Environment Institute, the national pollution control authority (known by its Finnish abbreviation SYKE).<p><p>“SYKE runs a 24–7 hotline for oil-spill alerts. One of our three main vessels is always ready to respond to a spill within four hours,” says SYKE response commander Kalervo Jolma. “Cleanup efforts on the first day are vital. We reckon on a maximum of three days to act before oil becomes too dispersed to recover.”<p><p>Closing the loop: Boats tow oil-containment equipment in HELCOM’s oil-spill readiness drill on the Baltic Sea.Photo: Finnish Boarder Guard<p><p>“Finland’s national response fleet of oil-recovery vessels is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies,” says Jolma. “Our strengths include the ability to recover oil even in problematic icy conditions. The completion of a brand new multipurpose pollution control vessel will further improve our response capacity.”<p><p>Many of the vessels practising cleanup procedures in the gulf use booms, skimmers and brushes bearing the logos of the Finnish company Lamor, a leading global producer of oil-spill recovery equipment.<p><p>With a veterinarian present to supervise and instruct them, WWF volunteers increase their oil-spill readiness by practising tubefeeding a bird. (No wildlife was harmed during the exercise.)Photo: Alexandra Antell/WWF<p><p>Baltic marine and coastal ecosystems are highly sensitive to oil pollution. SYKE’s expertise on environmental protection is vital during oil-spill emergencies. The aim is always to recover as much oil as possible offshore, to minimise cleanup costs and ecological damage.<p><p>The Balex exercise also rehearses responses to ecological impacts. “It takes many pairs of hands to collect oil from polluted shores and to clean oiled birds,” says Jari Luukkonen of WWF Finland. “WWF have a network of more than 6,000 volunteers prepared to help, including hundreds trained to clean beaches or oiled birds.”<p><p>In addition to Finland, other members of HELCOM include Denmark, Estonia, the EU, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden.

You could say that the goal has been achieved, since today the Finns form one of the world’s most literate nations. Library services are municipally maintained, free of charge and guaranteed by law.<p><p>The average Finn makes ten visits to library per year and borrows 18 items, according to statistics from 2011.

Check out our slideshow below to see how, after decades of neglect, these remote islands and their rich cultural heritage and wildlife now face a brighter future.<p><p>Seabirds cry overhead as we sail through a splendid, island-dotted seascape towards the low rocky island of Söderskär and its looming lighthouse. Though we are just 30 kilometres east of Helsinki as the seagull flies, these windswept, wave-washed islands feel wild and remote.<p><p>The last lighthouse-keepers and their families left this lonely spot when the lighthouse lantern was automated more than 50 years ago, and their wooden houses soon fell into disrepair. For decades, this part of the Gulf of Finland was only occasionally visited by fishermen and birdwatchers, and many islands remained the preserve of the military and coastguard services. But responsibility for the archipelago is now shifting to Metsähallitus Natural Heritage Services – the organisation that manages Finland’s national parks.<p><p>“We feel the best way to preserve the rich cultural and natural heritage of these islands is to keep them alive and in use,” says senior advisor Tiina Niikkonen from Metsähallitus. “Through two EU-funded projects we are restoring Söderskär’s wooden buildings, and networking with local firms and organisations to build up sustainable tourism and enable people to come here and enjoy the islands.”<p><p>“The 150-year-old lighthouse and the old lighthouse-keepers’ and pilots’ homes are listed as a nationally important cultural setting,” adds cultural heritage expert Minttu Perttula, also a senior advisor at Metsähallitus. “Finland’s National Board of Antiquities is overseeing restoration work that will show visitors what life was like in this isolated community.” Söderskär also has historical military defence structures dating back to the Second World War.<p><p>The islands around Söderskär are rich in birdlife, providing refuge for many breeding sea ducks, shore birds, and rare gulls and terns. The old pilot’s house at Söderskär has long been used by ornithologists to monitor numbers of breeding and migrating birds. In spring 2012, as many as a million arctic geese, divers, waders and sea ducks were counted passing through.<p><p>“In future we hope the pilot’s house will continue to be used by ornithologists from Birdlife Finland so this valuable work can be continued,” says Niikkonen. “Söderskär forms part of Baltic-wide, EU-wide and worldwide nature conservation networks, so everything we do here must be planned carefully to protect the islands’ wildlife.”<p><p>During the seabird nesting season in spring and early summer, visitors can only come to Söderskär with organised tour groups. Many parts of the island are roped off to protect well-camouflaged mother eider ducks sitting on their nests. Later in summer more independent visits and overnight stays are also possible.<p><p>Guided daytrips to Söderskär run three or four times a week during the summer from harbours in Helsinki. Island guides provide visitors with coffee, pancakes and stories about Söderskär’s history and former inhabitants. The lighthouse also houses exhibitions of local artists’ nature-themed works.<p><p>To cap it all, visitors can climb 40 metres up to the top of the lighthouse and enjoy magnificent views over the archipelago from the lantern room.

{"title": "Åland treasures maritime memories - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/aland-treasures-maritime-memories/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The greatly expanded Maritime Museum of Åland can be found in the town of Mariehamn. It represents a must-see for anyone interested in sea travel or the unique history of Finland’s autonomous Åland Islands.<p><p>Seafaring has naturally been central to the lives of the Åland islanders in their labyrinthine Baltic archipelago, located between mainland Finland and Sweden. “To understand Åland and its people you really have to look into our maritime history,” says museum director Hanna Hagmark-Cooper.<p><p>In the middle ages, islanders used to sail to Stockholm, Turku and Tallinn to sell surplus fish and buy goods they could not produce themselves. As the Baltic region industrialised, several major shipping companies grew up and thrived in Åland. “Mariehamn was the last port in the world to continue running a large fleet of sailing ships, even into the 1940s,” says Hagmark-Cooper. Åland’s maritime museum was first founded when local people realised that the great age of sail was coming to an end.<p><p>Old favourites such as well-preserved figureheads are still on display.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>“Over the decades people kindly brought more and more objects in, which were put on display with little planning,” says Hagmark-Cooper. “The museum became so cluttered that we clearly needed to expand and redesign the whole exhibition. “During reconstruction lasting more than two years, the museum has doubled in size and its exhibits have for the first time been systematically organised and labelled– in Finnish and English, as well as Swedish (Åland’s main language).<p><p>Hagmark-Cooper is particularly proud of the museum’s new interactive exhibits. Visitors can learn the ropes, climb replicated rigging, stand on a stern deck, lift dockside loads and use simulators to steer vessels into port. Kids clearly enjoy spying on the antics of Ruby the ship rat through peepholes around the museum.<p><p>“But our local visitors have been relieved to find old favourites such as model ships, our well-preserved figureheads and the beautiful captain’s saloon from the old sailing ship Herzogin Cecilie, all still here – and placed better in context,” says Hagmark-Cooper. “Nautical enthusiasts can also find a wealth of information using our library and e-info points.”<p><p>Moored by the quayside outside the museum is the Pommern, a splendid four-masted sailing barque built in 1903.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Moored by the quayside outside the museum is the Pommern, a splendid four-masted sailing barque built in 1903. Owned by Mariehamn-based shipping company Erikson in the 1930s, the Pommern twice won the annual Great Grain Races sailed by ships bringing wheat from Australia to Europe. Onboard exhibits and films give visitors a salty taste of a sailor’s life in bygone days.<p><p>Another striking part of the museum is a Cabinet of Curiosities containing exotic souvenirs brought by seafarers from distant ports. Exhibits include aboriginal boomerangs, an enormous stuffed albatross and a genuine skull-and-crossbones flag that flew over a fearsome pirate ship off the Barbary Coast in the 1700s.<p><p>A genuine skull-and-crossbones pirate ship flag from the 1700s.Photo: Maritime Museum of Åland<p><p>The museum also spotlights modern aspects of nautical life including maritime safety, war at sea and shipbuilding methods. In recent years sailing enthusiasts in Åland have built several wooden vessels using traditional local designs. Examples can be seen in Mariehamn’s Maritime Quarter by the town’s eastern harbour.<p><p>“In the museum we also want to show how the shipping industry is still vital for Åland’s economy today,” says Hagmark-Cooper. The huge cruise ferries that call at Mariehamn en route between Finland and Sweden combine necessity and luxury: giving Åland a vital link to the outside world, while also bringing in tourists on scenic archipelago cruises. Hagmark-Cooper hopes that up to 50,000 visitors a year will discover Åland’s colourful history and thriving nautical traditions in the newly opened museum<p><p> <p><p>By Fran Weaver, June 2012, updated July 2014<p><p>Putting the museum in ship shape<p><p>Eye-catching exhibits<p>", "time": "2014-07-10T13:14:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

More and more citizens and visitors in the Finnish capital are discovering the benefits of a two-wheel run-around, especially with a new crosstown bike path opening.<p><p>Summer in Helsinki is always a heady time for cyclists. The city offers some exquisite rides, out into the thickly forested Central Park, for instance, across the string of islands of Lehtisaari and Kaskisaari to the west, or following the banks of the Vantaa River.<p><p>June 12, 2012 marks the annual Helsinki Day celebrations, but also the opening of a new crosstown bike path nicknamed Baana. Built over the old freight rail connecting the Töölö Bay area and the suburb of Ruoholahti, it forms a source of excitement for cyclists and further raises the profile of cycling culture.<p><p>As cycling cities go, Helsinki scores reasonably highly. “Good things are happening,” says Petteri Nisula of HePo, an acronym for Helsingin Polkupyöräilijät (Helsinki Cyclists). “We have the go-ahead for the first advance cycle stop lines, where cyclists can go ahead of cars in traffic at crossroads.<p><p>“Within a couple of years there will be one-direction cycling lanes along the central part of Mannerheimintie, running from the Swedish Theatre to the main post office and Kiasma [the museum of contemporary art]. And another new route will open across the new Aurora Bridge linking the Olympic Stadium with Central Park.”<p><p>Even so, says Nisula, a few challenges remain to be tackled before Helsinki can claim to be a truly great cycling city, on a par with the likes of Amsterdam and Copenhagen.<p><p>“Most of our cycle paths in the city run alongside pedestrian paths,” he says. “At the moment this leads to problems for both cyclists and walkers. A different kind of traffic system is needed.” Another typical hazard, he says, occurs when a car is turning at crossroads and the motorist may not always see cyclists about to cross or pass.<p><p>HePo, which represents Finland in the European Cyclists Federation, does all it can to promote the cycling cause, holding breakfasts for people riding to work and organising regular group ride events.<p><p>Cycling is healthy, cheap and environmentally friendly.

Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>On the face of it, cycling might seem to be exclusively a summer pastime, but Nisula sees no reason why more people should not consider cycling in the winter, although this too requires a mindset shift.<p><p>“There are more winter cyclists in other Finnish cities like Oulu and Jyväskylä, where the winters are much longer and more severe than in Helsinki,” he says. “It’s a bit of a paradox. But if the roads are managed well, if you wear the right clothes and if you look after your bicycle, it’s not so hard to cycle in winter.”<p><p>He welcomes the fact that more central Helsinki hotels are loaning out bicycles, although bike rental is still limited to a few outlets. A common summer sight downtown these days is the convoys of cruise ship passengers on cycling excursions – a function that the classic gearless Finnish Jopo city bike serves perfectly.<p><p>In summers past, Helsinki had a “deposit only” city bike loan scheme. It may start up again in a summer or two using credit card deposits or some other system, a move that Nisula would welcome.<p><p>HePo is involved in lobbying for better cycling facilities. Although Helsinki installs a number of new bike paths each year, there’s always room for improvement.<p><p>“We have good ideas but we need money to make them happen,” says Nisula. “In Finland we have been concentrating much of our investment in car lanes and motor traffic, and now for climate reasons we have to change our attitudes and recognise that cycling can form an important part of our traffic system and invest in it.”<p><p>Nisula takes an optimistic view of the future of cycling in the capital and in Finland as a whole. “Attitudes are changing and the statistics show it, too.

A Finnish interdisciplinary virtual school named Environment Online (ENO) continues its speedy growth, now recruiting Israeli education authorities for the cause.<p><p>Just over a decade ago in the promised land of technology and forestry known as Finland, in the eastern town of Joensuu, a relatively ordinary teacher began asking himself a question: How can we get teachers and pupils around the world to talk, share and work together against the notion that “sustainability” is nothing but a popular-science buzzword?<p><p>Mika Vanhanen’s previously utopian idea of a global school became possible as the breadth and reach of the internet increased.<p><p>He teamed up with like-minded people to create an online space for educators to communicate with one another across borders and subject areas, gain accessibility to high-quality material and tools to help them speak a language that young people can understand. ENO was the name of Vanhanen’s brainchild – short for Environment Online, but also the name of a Joensuu suburb.<p><p>Coincidentally eno is the Finnish word for “uncle” – an image that actually describes the organisation pretty well. A bit like an uncle, ENO oversees and guides but does not command. Programs are adapted by regional representatives to suit the needs of individual areas and further developed based on the feedback.<p><p>So too in Israel, one of 150 ENO countries and its longest-standing partner in the Middle East. \"Participating schools become providers of local knowledge about flora, fauna, soil, agriculture, urban aspects, arts and crafts and youth movement, based on students’ research,\" says Carmella Baranga, ENO’s coordinator for Israel.<p><p>The current total of 5,000 ENO schools globally is best explained by ENO’s diverse regional recipes, which are, as Baranga puts it, homemade.<p><p>Behind the pedagogical process is an old truth: You learn by doing. For this reason, ENO’s core activity is not located in cyberspace, but is literally as down-to-earth as you can get: The children plant their own trees.<p><p>Photo: ENO<p><p>ENO’s goals, which include “concrete deeds against climate change,” possess the power to engage and create genuine interest and commitment among young participants.<p><p>Planting activity forms a monitored, integrated part of the ENO programme. Suitable indigenous tree species are picked for each region and planting is intensified in areas suffering from deforestation.<p><p>Official tree-planting days are held twice a year, and 2011 is the UN International Year of Forests – an added incentive for schools to get their kids planting.<p><p>A specific goal has been set for schools worldwide: to plant 100 million trees by the 100th anniversary of Finland in 2017. Never mind the fact that they are still 95 million short of their target. Aim high and you’ll reach high – isn’t that what teachers always say?<p><p>A breakthrough occurred in November 2010 when a decision by the Israeli Ministry of Education made Israel the first country to grant the ENO program official status in the national education system.<p><p>Photo: ENO<p><p>Top-down approval has meant a massive step forward for sustainable education in Israel. A separate subdivision was created within the ministry for sustainable teaching and learning. Whereas previously schools taking part in the ENO programme were found only in the south, they now exist all over the country.<p><p>Tree planting is what kids seem to love most about ENO, and Israeli children are no exception. The global planting days in May and September are so popular that Israel also created a tree planting day of its own, held on the Jewish holiday known as the New Year of the Trees, which takes place in January or February (January 20 in 2011, February 8 in 2012).<p><p>In some settings, peace and tolerance might seem very abstract when named as aims or results of ENO’s activities. This can hardly be said about the Middle East. Baranga notes that the programme promotes “ethical values such as respect for other people, customs and religions, preservation of local culture and personal responsibility.”<p><p>Since ENO became officially recognised in Israel, children in all schools, regardless of religion or ethnicity, have been helping enlarge the ENO forest. Ethnic differences tend to fade into the background when you see the sprouts you planted together become thriving trees.

Afterwards, he logs on to his school account on his laptop and checks his Learning Diary, looking over the presentations he submitted yesterday. For one of his physics assignments, he and two friends decided to answer the questions by creating a short film, which they then filed in their Learning Diary. Other students chose various formats: One used a slide presentation, a few others handed in word processing documents.<p><p>Jussi’s teacher, Mrs B., has reviewed the submission, and left annotations and comments for Jussi and his partners to read.

Using a multitude of net-based tools and the need to incorporate video, pictures, and sound files made it necessary to create a place that could display and store work produced in various file formats and with a multitude of tools.<p><p>Nothing else quite like it exists in education – in Finland or elsewhere. The Learning Diary itself is a consequence, not the source of change. The actual source of change is a remarkable inversion in education, envisioned by the community and the school together. <p><p>Kauniainen is a small town west of Helsinki, with a well-educated population. At the heart of the development process is a realisation that the good education of today would not be good enough for tomorrow. There was a conviction that schooling today was not sufficiently preparing their kids for a world that will change even more rapidly than it does today. We needed to evolve and change – not just improve existing processes.<p><p>In 2006 the local school authority brought in leading thinkers from outside to brainstorm with the community and the school to help define a progressive pathway to reinvent what was already an excellent school system. This was the new covenant between the community and the school – to do everything possible to encourage all students to learn. Consistent with the ambitions and results, the local school authority named it the Dream School.<p><p>The goal is to defragment and unify the process of learning. The Learning Diary represents one of our enabling tools. This student-centric pedagogy strives to recognise and harness the rapidly evolving real-world knowledge our students possess. Instead of the curriculum being a distribution mechanism for fixed knowledge, it incorporates the knowledge students themselves create and have to share. In this rethink, the teacher is not the only source of knowledge. The student is also invested in the knowledge development and sharing process.<p><p>The Dream School ambition required rethinking the use of IT to address simultaneous but opposite needs: to increase efficient and creative IT use, and to cut costs. The most important communication takes place face to face, and the aim was to create good tools, practises and savings that could be reinvested in greater teacher involvement and easier ways to tailor the learning process.<p><p>To support their goals, the parties involved opted for an open source, cloud-based technology model. Closed models are more expensive, and they do not harness the necessary innovation. For example, the Learning Diary is an open source application, developed in collaboration with a supplier within the framework of a public–private partnership.<p><p>Photo: Dream School<p><p>The Linux-based Dream School service platform utilises open source products that are cost-effective and easy to use. The users are also active participants in the development of tools that meet their demands. This is a marked contrast to the model with which the education sector is familiar: software purchasing.<p><p>Within the framework of the public–private partnership, renowned companies provide services to the school, such as educational software, communication tools and administrative tools. The school participates in product development. Importantly, the partner companies can market these services on an open source basis to other schools.<p><p>The focal point is the empowered user. With a single sign-in, a user can access all services and communication. The aim is to shorten the distance between the user and what he or she wants to accomplish. All parts of the system are economical, energy efficient and environmentally sound. The ease and reliability of the system form motivating factors for the users.<p><p>Innovation and development is ongoing. The initiatives to further develop the Dream School concept in the areas of school administration, decision-making, assessment, pedagogy and IT are continuously being developed and improved. The Dream School has several other initiatives and ongoing public–private partnership projects with universities, researchers and developers of learning materials – including games. <p><p>Dream School info and news Dream School animation<p><p> <p><p>By Sirkku Nikamaa, February 2011<p><p>Remarkable inversion in education <p><p>Students as knowledge providers<p><p>Open source empowers users<p><p>Links:<p>", "time": "2011-02-18T14:42:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "The key to the nation’s success - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/the-key-to-the-nations-success/", "review": "", "content": "<p>A great deal of international attention has been attracted by the repeated success of Finnish 15-year-old pupils and their level of ability as measured in the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) studies organised by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development).<p><p>Thumbs up for education: This Finnish language and literature textbook is named after famous author Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872).Photo: Lehtikuva <p><p>One of the Finnish education system’s major strengths is its ability to guarantee the same educational opportunities for everyone, regardless of social or economic background. Instead of competition and comparison, comprehensive school focuses on support and guidance for the students as individuals.<p><p>Teachers are highly trained; teaching at all levels of education requires a master’s degree, including extensive studies in educational science and in school subjects. The teaching profession is held in high regard.<p><p><p><p>Finnish schools encourage pupils to be independent when thinking, studying and doing research.Photo: Ministry of Education and Culture/L.Takala<p><p>Young pupils have the same teacher for all or most of the subjects, which supports them emotionally and provides a sense of security. The same teacher also makes sure the class atmosphere remains free of discrimination and harassment. Graded evaluation of learning performance usually starts only once students reach the fifth year. Relations between the students and teachers are friendly and relaxed, and motivation is based on encouragement rather than punishment.<p><p>After comprehensive school, all students have the opportunity to focus their attention on general and professional education according to their inclinations. People can continue to study in various forms throughout their lives. Twenty-five percent of all Finns hold a degree from a university or polytechnic; the figure is 36 percent for the 25–34 age group.<p><p>Education is free from preschool through university. Using tax revenues to finance education ensures high quality and equal opportunities for all.<p><p>Finland’s rankings<p><p>2012<p><p>2009<p><p>2006<p><p>2003<p><p>Finland ranks at or near the top in all the PISA studies, organised every three years since the year 2000 by OECD. PISA measures the competence of 15-year-old pupils in mathematics, science and reading literacy. It is particularly noteworthy that among Finnish schoolchildren the difference between top-scorers and low-scorers is small, and that ability levels are strong in all types of schools.<p><p>* J.V. Snellman (1806–1881), a philosopher, scholar, journalist and politician who played a unique, important role in forming the Finnish national identity<p><p>Finnish children start school the autumn of the calendar year that they turn seven. This gives them a longer time to play, use their imaginations and develop secure attachment before attending school.Photo: Amanda Soila<p><p>In the modern world, a well-educated, skilful population forms the key to a country’s success.The rise of Finnish society to the ranks of the world’s richest countries in the second half of the 1900s stemmed largely from the population’s demand for public education and the country’s investment in it.<p><p>As early as the 1800s, major decisions sowed the seeds for the continuing success of the education system. Finland decided on education for the entire nation. In this way, the country avoided social inequality between an educated elite and an uneducated lower class. The population’s desire to learn has also contributed to a general faith in education. People are expected to stay informed about a wide range of issues and societal concerns.<p><p>Finding solutions to the challenges facing society – climate change, global economic fluctuations, an ageing population, risks connected with modern technology, pandemics and mass migration – calls for lifestyle changes and new kinds of activism. In Finland and everywhere else in the world, a growing flood of information and the movement of people are now creating new challenges for traditional education. No matter how strong an education system is, it needs constant development and renewal to maintain its success. The better educated a nation is, the better it will be equipped to face the complex challenges of today’s world.<p><p>“The high level of the Finnish school system is backed by a clear national ethos that says the people are the nation’s most important resource and they have a right to a quality education,” says the director of general education Jorma Kauppinen of the Finnish National Board of Education.<p><p>School days in Finland are shorter than in most OECD countries, but the time spent at school is used effectively.Photo: Ministry of Education and Culture/Liisa Takala<p><p>Between 11 and 12 percent of the Finnish state and municipal budget is spent on education. This pays for free preschool, basic education, upper-secondary school, vocational training, higher education and continuing and post-graduate studies, and partially funds liberal adult education. This, in turn, forms the backbone of lifelong learning, available to everyone who lives in Finland.<p><p>“The establishment of the primary school system was linked to the awakening of a strong national consciousness,” Kauppinen says. “The nation needed literate, educated citizens and a literary culture.”<p><p>The majority of Finnish municipalities had primary schools by the early 1900s. The Compulsory School Attendance Act came into force in 1921, requiring all children to complete at least six years of primary school.<p><p>A major turning point came about in the 1970s, when primary and secondary schools were replaced by mainly municipal nine-year comprehensive schools compulsory school attendance was lengthened to nine years. The comprehensive school reform aimed to guarantee equal and free basic education for all children, regardless of the family’s place of residence and socio-economic status.<p><p>Play and nurture prepare kids for school<p><p>School starts comparatively late in Finland, at the age of seven. According to Finnish educational practice, children need time and space to grow and develop. Learning utilises a sensitive period in children’s lives and encourages their thinking and creativity. During the early school years, families receive verbal feedback on the child’s schoolwork.<p><p>In early childhood years, children enjoy the care and nurture of their parents. Kids also participate in group activities at daycare: play, sports and outdoor activities. Parents of young children are ensured long periods of maternity and parental leave. Families can also choose between municipal and private daycare centres, or opt for small group daycare in a child carer’s home.<p><p>Six-year-old children have access to free preschool education, either at a school or at their daycare. Nearly all six-year-olds participate in preschool.<p><p>If necessary, a child may start school a year earlier or later after an evaluation assesses their school readiness.<p><p>Finland contains approximately 3,000 comprehensive schools with a total of 550,000 students. In practice, the municipalities are responsible for organising the teaching. In one of its most significant findings, the PISA study concluded that out of all the participants, Finland has the smallest differences between schools.<p><p>“This result stems from the local-schools principle, highly educated teachers and a culture of trust,” summarises Mr. Kauppinen.<p><p>The local-schools principle means that almost all children and young adults attend the school closest to their homes, pre-empting divisions according to family social status. Since schools maintain a reliably high standard, parents are generally satisfied with their local schools, and elite private schools have not emerged alongside local comprehensive schools. Subject to licensing, private schools exist to some extent, but they also receive state funding and follow the national curriculum, and are obliged to include pupils from the local district.<p><p>Municipalities fund school transport for children who live too far away to walk or to use public transport.<p><p>Teacher training includes both pedagogical skills and in-depth knowledge of curricular subjects. Although the curriculum and the learning objectives are decided at the national level, teachers can choose their methods freely in the classroom.<p><p>Students receive support and guidance in small groups as necessary.Photo: Amanda Soila<p><p>“Power is delegated to municipalities, schools and ultimately individual teachers, with all levels of educational administration interacting and sharing notes,” explains Kauppinen. “This culture of trust produces teachers who are independent experts.” On one hand, they are familiar with their own students’ needs and opportunities, and on the other hand, they respect national curricular objectives.<p><p>High-quality teaching materials hold great importance. Large investments support the production of school books and other learning materials in Finnish as well as Swedish, Finland’s other official language. Materials are increasingly available in electronic form and online.<p><p>Kauppinen believes that the future challenge for schools will be in developing cooperation between home and school, and in advancing dialogue between schools and the surrounding society.<p><p>Teacher education ensures quality teaching<p><p>All comprehensive school teachers with a permanent full-time post hold a university degree.<p><p>In primary school (grades 1–6), teachers usually teach all subjects. They hold a master’s degree in education with an emphasis on pedagogical skills. In both lower secondary school and upper-secondary school, subject-specific teaching is provided by teachers who have completed a master’s degree in their respective fields and have completed studies in educational science.<p><p>Daycare and preschool teachers are also university graduates.<p><p>Teacher education is a very popular field, and enjoys high esteem in spite of the relatively modest level of pay. There are five times as many applicants for teacher education as there are places.<p><p>Young pupils spend recess playing outside, rain or shine.Photo: Amanda Soila <p><p>Finns are offered free education throughout their lives, from nursery school to the highest academic degrees.<p><p>Young Finns complete their compulsory education in comprehensive secondary school. Their compulsory education ends when they have either completed the entire 9-year basic education curriculum or, at the latest, by the age of 16 years old.<p><p>After comprehensive school, half of all pupils go on to upper-secondary school – approximately 60 percent of the girls and approximately 42 percent of the boys. Upper-secondary school studies last two to four years, culminating in the matriculation examination.<p><p>The other half of the same age group goes into vocational studies. Approximately 5 percent of those who complete comprehensive school do not continue studying. The goal, however, is that everyone completes at least upper-secondary education, i.e. the matriculation examination or a basic vocational qualification.<p><p>After upper-secondary school, students can decide whether they will go on to higher education at a university or polytechnic. The selection process takes into account the matriculation examination results and upper-secondary grades, and most departments also require an entrance examination. Students may also apply to university or polytechnic institutes if they have completed a three-year professional degree or the equivalent, so they may seek higher education even after vocational school. The system aims to prevent dead ends in all areas of education, including vocational education, so that it is always possible to progress to higher studies.<p><p>Those who have graduated and worked in a profession can access further vocational training or study an entirely new profession. In many fields, studies can be completed as on-the-job training under an apprenticeship scheme. People who have practised a profession may also prove their skills by taking a competence examination.<p><p>Central and local government broadly support basic education directed at creative hobbies and arts for children and youth, as well as liberal adult education that offers all-round education and classes based on hobbies and social interests.<p><p>School days start at 8:30 am and end no later than 3:30 pm. Photo: Ministry of Education and Culture/Liisa Takala<p><p>An ordinary school day at Meilahti Comprehensive School in western Helsinki is about to begin. Pupils hurry to their lockers and classrooms. There are merry greetings as pupils pass by each other; some of the greetings are also directed towards the principal, Riitta Erkinjuntti, whose door onto the main hall is open.<p><p>“Teachers and pupils are always welcome to come and see me when the door is open, and it is nearly always open,” says Erkinjuntti.<p><p>The school atmosphere is relaxed and tolerant, as it is in most Finnish schools. The pupils relate to each other respectfully but casually. Students call teachers by their first names and classes are taught in a very conversational manner.<p><p>Principal Riitta Erkinjuntti of the Meilahti Comprehensive SchoolPhoto: Amanda Soila<p><p>“Teaching is based on support, participation and interaction. The pupils work hard, but are not forced to do so by demands, intimidation or pressure,” says Erkinjuntti.<p><p>Her school has about 350 pupils in secondary school, classes 7 to 9. The pupils are from 13 to 16 years old. In addition to regular secondary school classes, the school also has art and music programmes. A bilingual Chinese-Finnish study group also exists, as well as a language immersion class where Finnish-speaking pupils study part of the day in Swedish, effortlessly learning the country’s second official language. There are special preparatory classes for immigrants and training classes for pupils with mild mental disabilities. Children in the special classes may come from outside the local school area.<p><p>“For pupils, it is good that they encounter all kinds of learners in their school environment, representing different cultures and different sorts of young people,” says Erkinjuntti. Many other Finnish schools use the same approach.<p><p>School days start at 8:30 am and end no later than 3:30 pm. The secondary school curriculum includes a lot of mathematics, Finnish, at least two foreign languages, humanities, natural sciences and art, as well as two hours of physical education every week.<p><p>Special support for pupils with learning difficulties<p><p>According to international assessments, one of the special strengths of Finnish schools is the way the schools support students who are struggling with learning difficulties or need other support. You cannot get through Finnish school without developing basic skills in reading, maths and other areas. Every child and young person has the right to a quality education, regardless of his or her personal conditions or limitations.<p><p>Pupils are entitled to special assistance as soon as the need arises. Common forms of support include remedial teaching in small groups, individual counselling and teaching pupils in accordance with individual conditions, even when they are studying in the same class as others. Most schools have special teachers and nearly all have visiting teaching assistants to help with needy pupils. If a child is found to have a wide-ranging, permanent learning difficulty, a personal learning plan is formulated for the pupil. Pupils with mild to moderate learning difficulties study in the same schools and classrooms as everyone else, but the schools receive additional resources in these cases.<p><p>Pupils with mental disabilities and children with severe sensory or physical disabilities or special health or mental health problems study in special classes or schools, and for some of them compulsory education lasts 11 years.<p><p>Children of immigrants receive many kinds of support at school. Those who do not speak Finnish or Swedish well are offered preparatory education in small groups where they get to learn the Finnish language with an adapted syllabus. In major cities, children from immigrant backgrounds have access to language lessons in their own mother tongue.<p><p>The enthusiasm of the students and teachers at Meilahti Comprehensive is enhanced by cooperation with various organisations, including art institutes, sports clubs and the local church. A variety of projects help the school keep up with developments in computer technology and other areas. Meilahti produces good learning results, and has been selected once as a PISA school.<p><p>“Our school system makes it possible for schools to avoid constantly competing against each other,” says Erkinjuntti. “We focus on supporting pupils based on their own unique situation.”<p><p>Arts and practical subjects are particularly important in this respect.<p><p>Student wellbeing and interaction between students are two areas that receive special attention.Photo: Ministry of Education and Culture/Liisa Takala<p><p>“Subjects where you can express yourself support a balanced, growing personality. Gifted students have the opportunity to go deeper into these subjects in special classes. This helps improve motivation and provides an additional challenge.”<p><p>Principal Erkinjuntti believes that the success of Finnish schools is largely due to the values and human image of the school community. A young person can acquire knowledge and skills more readily when she or he feels accepted, respected and trusted. Bullying and other issues harmful to wellbeing are addressed without delay.<p><p>In Erkinjuntti’s experience, some of the most significant challenges connected with childhood education are parents’ lack of time and young adults’ need for more attention from the grown-ups in their lives. In modern society children often have to grow up too fast. They have to become independent and resilient early on.<p><p>Another challenge is the flood of information. “We live in a world of unlimited information, and this also affects schools,” says Erkinjuntti. “How will the schools of the future determine what to focus on? Where do you draw the line?”<p><p>Ensuring student wellbeing<p><p>Each school has a student welfare unit and school health services. Student welfare has to do with the school’s responsibility for social, mental and physical wellbeing. The school may act if pupils shirk school, are chronically late, become marginalised from the class community, use drugs or alcohol, or suffer from an unstable family situation. In these cases, the adults in the school have a right and a duty to work towards a solution together with the parents, and, if necessary, to turn to municipal healthcare, child welfare or social services for advice.<p><p>Schoolchildren receive regular health and dental check-ups and, if necessary, are sent for further examination to the municipal health services. School health services are free of charge.<p><p>Oona Niemelä (centre) checking graphic prints with her classmates.Photo: Amanda Soila<p><p>Ninth-grader Oona Niemelä’s day at school<p><p>Fifteen-year-old Oona Niemelä wakes up before seven and eats breakfast with her family. Then she takes a half-hour bus ride to school. She studies in the ninth grade at Meilahti Comprehensive School with an emphasis on visual arts.<p><p>Meilahti is not the closest school to Oona’s home, but she applied there specifically for the visual arts programme.<p><p>“For the entry test, I had to do a pencil drawing and a watercolour painting,” Oona says. “I was nervous, but luckily I passed.” In her opinion, the best thing about Meilahti Comprehensive is a positive environment that encourages students to stay active. You do not have to be worried about being bullied at school.<p><p>Oona’s favourite subjects are the visual arts and languages. She likes physics and religion less.<p><p>“Homework takes about an hour and half a day, but before tests I study longer. I don’t usually need my parents’ help to do my homework.”<p><p>Oona’s school days last five to seven hours. Each morning and afternoon includes a 15-minute recess, and halfway through the day there is a half-hour lunch break. During the breaks, she mingles with her friends; in good weather they are outside in the schoolyard.<p><p>After school, Oona keeps busy with her hobbies. She takes piano lessons at a music school and goes horseback riding once a week. Oona gets to her hobbies independently on public transport, just as most young people do in Helsinki.<p><p>Evenings include homework and piano practice. Oona also spends time chatting with friends online, talking on the phone and watching television. With so many activities during the week, she hangs out with her friends mostly on weekends.<p><p>The lights go out in Oona’s room at about 10:00 pm.<p><p>After comprehensive school, Oona is planning to go to upper-secondary school. She would like to attend Sibelius High School, where they offer a special music programme.<p><p>“I’m not really planning a career in the arts, but I think it would be nice to get more into music and art, just for my own sake,” Oona says.<p><p>The Finnish educational system<p><p>Source: Ministry of Education and Culture<p><p>The government decides on the general objectives and the division of hours between comprehensive and upper-secondary school subjects. This is based on the national curriculum, which is decided on by the Finnish National Board of Education under the Ministry of Education and Culture. Education providers, most of which are the municipalities, then develop their own curricula and school-specific plans based on this foundation. In this way, all pupils across the country receive the same subjects at the same level and quality. At the same time, the system also allows for local emphasis and enhancement.<p><p>Students’ learning outcomes in comprehensive school are monitored by national assessments, involving a random sampling of about 5 percent. Additionally, those responsible for organising the teaching are required to perform evaluations on a regular basis.<p><p>Upper-secondary school studies culminate in the national matriculation examination, assessed by the National Matriculation Examinations Board.<p><p>Photo: Amanda Soila<p><p>by Minna Kantén<p><p>Every child in a Finnish daycare centre, elementary or secondary school or vocational college is provided with a hot, healthy lunch including salad, milk and bread.<p><p>The free lunch served at school forms a component of the official curriculum. The idea is that a meal break at school refreshes the children and helps them through the remainder of the day. At the same time it is a lesson in health, nutrition and customs.<p><p>In some pioneering schools, the students are offered climate-friendly meals such as vegetarian and organic lunches.<p><p>Schoolchildren’s favourite lunch menus<p><p>Photo: A.

The territory of the Sámi, Europe’s only indigenous people, also stretches through northern Norway and Sweden and into a corner of Russia.<p><p>Sajos (which means “base camp” in Sámi) also houses the new Sámi Cultural Centre, encompassing a 430-seat auditorium that can be used as a theatre or concert hall; meeting rooms for local associations; classrooms for adult education; a Sámi social services centre; the Sámi archives; a library; and a shop specialising in Sámi books and handicrafts.<p><p>“The opening of Sajos represents a great new opportunity for us Sámi, providing an ideal venue for all kinds of cultural events,” says Sámi singer Anna Näkkäläjärvi, whose band Ánnámáret Ensemble performed at the building’s official opening ceremony on April 3, 2012. The event was timed to coincide with the inauguration by Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö of the newly elected 21-member Sámi Parliament, which will serve for four years.<p><p>Näkkäläjärvi manages the Sámi Music Centre, which is also based at Sajos. Like other Sámi musicians, Ánnámáret Ensemble are proud of their roots and the haunting sounds of traditional Sámi singing styles, but not afraid to mix in influences from other musical cultures. “It’s important to do this to keep our own culture truly alive,” explains Näkkäläjärvi.<p><p>The Northern Lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, sway above Sajos, the new Sámi cultural and political centre in Inari, Finnish Lapland. Video: Andy Keen<p><p>“This is the first time that Finland’s Sámi have really had our own house where we can gather under one roof,” says Sajos’s manager Marja Männistö.<p><p>“It felt wonderful when we had 450 Sámi children singing together here in March for a children’s arts event – and I’m really looking forward to the music festival of indigenous peoples, Ijahis idja (Nightless Night) which we host in August, welcoming guest performers from other indigenous peoples as well as Sámi musicians.” It is hoped that Sajos will also reactivate a Sámi theatre tradition that has recently suffered due to the lack of a suitable arena.<p><p>“We’re also producing school books here in all three of the distinct Sámi languages spoken in Finland,” adds Männistö, who is a member of the Skolt Sámi – a minority within a minority. Skolt Sámi is today spoken by only about 300 people in Finnish Lapland, while Inari Sámi has some 300 speakers and about 2,000 people speak Northern Sámi. The municipality of Inari uniquely has four official languages – the three Sámi languages and Finnish.<p><p>Anna Näkkäläjärvi sings with her band Ánnámáret Ensemble at the Sajos opening festivities.Photo: Tea Karvinen<p><p>Sajos is a truly eye-catching work of architecture, clearly influenced by northern natural scenery.

A generation ago, 90 percent of the Finnish population held membership in the Evangelical Lutheran Church, whereas now the number has shrunk to about 75 percent and is falling by about one percentage point annually. Ties between Church and State have also decreased.<p><p>“Church membership no longer forms a social norm,” says Irja Askola, bishop of Helsinki. “Nowadays it’s more of a personal choice. Nor does the Church wield unquestioned authority anymore. This gives rise to a challenge – the institution must become a living community – and that’s a good development.”<p><p>While the role of the Church as an institution has weakened, its social role has grown. This becomes apparent in the reinforcement and expansion of diaconical work. For instance, the Church represents one of the most important providers of family counselling, and plays a central role in professional crisis work.<p><p>A typical interior of a Finnish Evangelical Lutheran church (Joensuu, eastern Finland).Photo: Jorma Pesonen<p><p>The Church gets involved in societal issues. “Our job is not to express opinions about the political questions of the day, but rather to get decision-makers to notice the plight of the weakest members of society,” says Askola.<p><p>“We build bridges in the midst of disagreements, and help construct a civilised, safe society. We convey the message that every person has inherent value, even if he or she is unproductive or unsuccessful or has done wrong.”<p><p>One topic of conversation in modern Finnish society is that of immigration and xenophobic statements. Askola says that for the Church, multiculturalism doesn’t raise any eyebrows.<p><p>“Ecumenically, Finland is a model country, and our dialogue has grown to encompass interfaith aspects.

Female priests were first allowed in the Church of Finland in 1986 after a long, drawn-out struggle, and the position of bishop was opened to women five years later.<p><p>Forty percent of all priests are currently women, and female priests are accepted by all except a small – though loud and tenacious – minority.<p><p>“I think that the rise of women within the Church has made the Church a topic of increased conversation,” says Askola. “The fact that there is a female bishop has made people curious and given the Church visibility in all kinds of media. It helps make spiritual questions a part of everyday life.”<p><p>In recent years the Church has had to grapple with the issue of sexual minorities. In 2002 Finland passed a law allowing same-sex couples to officially register their relationships. The conversation flared up again in the autumn of 2010 on primetime television, when a talkshow guest who was against homosexual relationships based her rigid beliefs on the Bible. In the following weeks a fervent public conversation raged and tens of thousands of people renounced their church memberships.<p><p>“This event showed the Church the power of the media and of social media, and we learned a lot,” says Askola. The bishop, who is known for her liberal views, believes that despite the loss of members, the conversation made the topic more natural, even commonplace.<p><p>Church leaders have since decided that priests were allowed to pray with and on behalf of same-sex couples in registered relationships. Askola said that she would like to welcome more same-sex couples for Church blessings, although she would not force any pastor to do so.<p><p>A bill legalising same-sex marriage passed the Finnish Parliament in late 2014 and was signed by the President early in 2015.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, April 2012, updated 2015<p><p>Building bridges<p><p>The Church’s First Lady<p><p>Talking about relationships<p><p>Religion in Finland<p>", "time": "2012-04-16T07:29:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

This proved true one day during a lunch stop at Wellamo, a small restaurant tucked into a corner of the peninsular Helsinki neighbourhood of Katajanokka.<p><p>Wellamo is not far from the water and a shoreline park. In this case, though, “nature” meant nature photos, hung on the restaurant walls for an exhibition called The crow and his friends – Nature photos both urban and other.<p><p>It was the show’s opening day and photographer Jukka Wuolijoki happened to be on hand to describe the stories behind the pictures. Click open the slideshow below to find out more, especially if you don’t live within easy reach of Wellamo – or Helsinki or Finnish Lapland – or if you’re reading this after the exhibition ends on March 18, 2012.<p><p>The first sunset: “In the far north of Finland, the sun may disappear under the horizon for more than seven weeks, depending on how far north you are,” says photographer Jukka Wuolijoki. “Where this was taken, the first sunrise comes on January 5. The sun comes up for just half an hour, then sets again, hence the red pillar of light.” Photo: Jukka Wuolijoki<p><p>A crow teacher at jackdaw school: “This crow (right) is teaching a class of jackdaws – a smaller bird related to the crow,” says Wuolijoki. “It’s teaching them the ways of the crows.” Photo: Jukka Wuolijoki<p><p>The crow and his friend: “In Otaniemi [just west of Helsinki], there’s a bench by the shore and this guy arrives each morning on his bike to feed the birds. As soon as he gets there, this crow, which has been sitting up in a tree somewhere, comes straight down and perches on the bench. They talk to each other in crow language, ‘Caw, caw.’” The painteresque background shows autumn reeds at the water’s edge.

{"title": "Your honeymoon with the Finnish language - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/your-honeymoon-with-the-finnish-language/", "review": "", "content": "<p>So you’re still thirsting to unlock more mysteries of the Finnish language and understand how the Finnish brain works? Check out these three dictionaries – the next level is always just a page turn away.<p><p>Alright, so you know the Finnish nicknames for red wine (punkku), white wine (valkkari) and that liquorice-flavoured vodka stuff (salmiakkikossu), and your array of weather-related expressions grows larger with each passing season. But you sense that there must be more than that to speaking Finnish, and indeed, more than that to life in Finland.<p><p>Happily, there is. This article will help you enrich your vocabulary and get on the path from intermediate to advanced with three little dictionaries. You’ll understand more of what’s going on around you, and you’ll be able to say what you mean – and mean what you say.<p><p>“Rytmitaju” (sense of rhythm) is exemplified by the Finnish cult band Leningrad Cowboys, who released a new album at the end of 2011.Photo: Dirk Behlau<p><p>Finnish Dictionary for the Language Learner (published by Finnlibri) offers Finnish-English wordlists under 150 different subject headings covering a broad range of situations, concepts and ideas. In the “Music” section you’ll gain rytmitaju (a sense of rhythm), and you’ll finally figure out all those S-words: sovittaa (arrange), sanoittaa (write lyrics), soittaa (play), säestää (accompany) and säveltää (compose).<p><p>Each section unfurls in alphabetical order, and this can yield a strange effect: “Family occasions” starts with avioero (divorce) and ends with vihkiäiset (marriage ceremony). However, somewhere in between you’ll also find häämatka (honeymoon) and kastetilaisuus (christening ceremony).<p><p>The strength of this dictionary lies in its format. Rather than looking up individual words, readers can review whole topics at a glance. How about “Feelings and moods,” “Location and direction” or “Hiding, losing and finding”? Get into “Society” and “School and education” – or skip straight to “Reptiles, lizards and amphibians.”<p><p>The unilingual Suomen sanakirja opiskelijoille ja ulkomaalaisille (Finnish Dictionary for Students and Foreign Learners, Gummerus) embodies another learning strategy. There comes a time when you need to branch out from bilingual dictionaries and go native.<p><p>Reading definitions of Finnish words in Finnish can increase your learning exponentially, if you take the plunge. With every entry, you pick up synonyms, and example sentences show you how the term is used. Viulu (violin) means nelikielinen jousisoitin, joka soitettaessa tuetaan leuan alle, “a four-stringed, bowed instrument supported under the jaw while playing.” At the same time you learn that Saat maksaa viulut, literally “You pay for the violins,” means “You cover the cost.”<p><p>As the title indicates, if you use this dictionary, you’re approaching the level of native Finnish-speaking students. An earlier edition was named Nykysuomen keskeinen sanasto (Essential vocabulary of modern Finnish) – another sign that you’re on the right track.<p><p>Duck! Finnish hockey star Teemu Selänne of the NHL team Anaheim Ducks finishes a “lämäri” (slapshot).Photo: Phillip MacCallum/AFP/Lehtikuva<p><p>Remember that sunny day long ago, when you came out of your first Finnish course ready to test your new-found knowledge? Chances are that you quickly realised spoken Finnish differs from the written Finnish in your lesson book. Something as simple as minä, meaning “I,” regularly changes to mä, or mie or mää in certain regions.<p><p>That’s just the beginning – Finnish contains just as many slang expressions as any other language, and has also borrowed words from English, Swedish and Russian. Oikeeta suomee: Suomen puhekielen sanakirja (Dictionary of Spoken Finnish, Gummerus) appears on the horizon to rescue you from Finnish-language oblivion. Its 7,000 entries show you how people really speak – this is where the secrets are revealed – and each one contains an English translation of the main word for good measure.<p><p>Opening at random, we find pearls such as lafka (store, enterprise), laiha lohtu (cold comfort), laiskamato (“lazy worm,” lazy person), lande (countryside), lälly (lame, dull), lämäri (slapshot) and lörpötellä (talk rubbish). The example sentences are even written in colloquial Finnish – picture an English dictionary full of “gonna” and “wanna.”<p><p>Learning Finnish can seem like a big job, but it’s perfectly doable. Let’s give the last word on the subject to the Oikeeta suomee dictionary. Under lunki (cool, calm, easy), you’ll find this: Ajattele sitä asiaa vaan ihan lunkisti äläkä hermoile. “Just consider things calmly – and take it easy!” <p><p>By Peter Marten, January 2012<p><p>A sense of rhythm<p><p>Going native<p><p>The unbearable lightness of speaking<p>", "time": "2013-05-23T07:25:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

In fact, some time ago you stopped considering yourself a beginner and promoted yourself to intermediate. Your vocabulary is growing stronger all the time and you know how to do more than just order beer and buy tram tickets.<p><p>However, how do you make the transition to that elusive next stage – the one where you truly grasp what people around you are talking about and really express yourself in conversation?

Ever decode a Finnish phrase but still fail to understand what it means? This book can help.<p><p>For example, you may realise that vetää nenästä translates directly to “pull by the nose,” but you might not comprehend unless you have Kielikuvia to tell you that it’s the equivalent of pulling someone’s leg in English. And if a Finn laittaa kaikki yhden kortin varaan (puts everything on one card), that person is putting all his or her eggs in one basket.<p><p>Amazingly, something that is täyttä hepreaa (complete Hebrew) in Finnish can simultaneously be all Greek to English speakers. And if something maksaa mansikoita (costs strawberries) for the Finns, that’s a bargain compared to what it costs for English speakers: an arm and a leg. Similarly, in Finnish you may joutua ojasta allikkoon (go from the ditch into the puddle), whereas English speakers must jump straight from the frying pan into the fire.<p><p>For systematically improving your vocabulary, a better bet may be Suomen kielen sanakirja maahanmuuttajille (Finnish Dictionary for Immigrants, Gummerus). It’s all in Finnish, so it doesn’t matter what your first language is.<p><p>Each entry contains a clearly written definition, followed by example sentences to show you how the word is used in context. Many entries include synonyms, antonyms and sayings.<p><p>If you look up rehkiä (toil), you’ll see the following (the English translations are ours): Kun joku rehkii, hän tekee liikaa töitä. (When someone toils, he or she does too much work.) We like the example sentence: Toimittaja rehkii pitkiä päiviä. (A journalist puts in long days.) And for good measure they add a synonym, raataa (drudge), and an antonym, laiskotella (laze around).<p><p>The authors admit in the foreword that “using a unilingual dictionary may seem strange to the reader at first, but it is worth it.” They continue, “The more students use the Finnish language, the more knowledgeable they become about the language and the better they can express themselves in Finnish.”<p><p>All “in the same boat”: This is one expression that is exactly the same in English and Finnish.Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>If you’re still thirsting for more definitions and figures of speech, take it to the next level with Suurella sydämellä ihan sikana – Suomen kielen kuvaileva fraasisanakirja (roughly: With Your Heart in It like Crazy: Dictionary of Finnish Figurative Phrases, Gummerus).<p><p>The foreword of this unilingual dictionary astutely notes that expressions “don’t just convey information, but also provide insights into a culture.” They also indicate feelings and moods. The definitions and example sentences help readers understand what the phrases mean and when they are used.<p><p>How about the verb mennä (to go)? In Finnish, things don’t “go to the dogs,” but something can mennä poskelleen (go on its cheek), mennä aivan penkin alle (go completely under the bench) or mennä puihin (go to the trees), all of which mean “to fail.” However, if things mennä putkeen (go into the pipe) or mennä nappiin (go to the button), then you’ve succeeded.<p><p>You need look only as far as the first letter of the alphabet to find your first ahaa-elämys (“aha experience,” meaning a flash of realisation) – and the rest of the book is full of them. <p><p>By Peter Marten, November 2011<p><p>Multilingual metaphors<p><p>Express yourself<p><p>Thirst for success<p>", "time": "2013-05-23T07:22:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Surname stories: Land of the –nens - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/surname-stories-land-of-the-nens/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The most common Finnish-language surnames include Korhonen, Virtanen, Nieminen, Mäkinen, Hämäläinen, Koskinen, Heikkinen and Järvinen. Yes, this land loves its –nen suffix, a sure way to recognise a Finnish surname.<p><p>More than a third of all Finns have surnames ending in -nen. Though the Finnish suffix –nen is normally a diminutive, in surnames it more often signifies belonging to a place where a family lived. Virtanen could literally mean “small stream,” but the surname was devised to mean a family living near a stream. Mäkinen, literally “small hill,” correspondingly meant the family from the hill.<p><p>“Many families chose this kind of surname made of a natural feature with the suffix –nen in the Finnish national romantic period of the 19th century,” explains Sirkka Paikkala, who studies Finnish surnames at the Research Institute for Languages of Finland.<p><p>“The –nen suffix was originally from Finland’s Eastern surname tradition, but in the 1800s such surnames were also adopted in the West and that’s why they are now so widespread,” she says.<p><p>There has recently been extremely tight competition for top ranking between the two most common Finnish surnames, Virtanen and Korhonen (the equivalents to Smith and Jones). But the Korhonens now seem to be taking a lead, by either breeding faster or living longer. In July 2014 the Finnish Population Register Centre announced that there are 23,380 Korhonens, compared to 23,141 Virtanens.<p><p>In third place we find Mäkinen with 21,113, and quickly catching up are the Nieminens in fourth place with 21,054. The obscure origins of the top surname Korhonen may be related to deafness or a word meaning “old man.”<p><p>Many surnames reflect the Finns’ close relationship to nature, for example a popular surname Kanerva (heather).Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>But it’s not all about the –nens. Many western Finnish surnames end in the suffix –la or –lä, which indicated association with a place (for example Mäkelä is connected to a hill) or a farmstead (Juhani Mattila indicates “Juhani from Matti’s farm”). “Some surnames also relate to a profession, like Seppälä for someone from a smithy,” Paikkala adds.<p><p>Many surnames reflect the Finns’ close relationship to nature. Examples include Kanerva (heather), Nummi (moor), Kivi (stone), Niemi (peninsula) and Halla (frost). In one Helsinki suburb a Mr Susi (wolf) lives next door to the Sikanen family, whose name can be understood as meaning “little pigs.”<p><p>During early 20th century many Finns translated their former Swedish-language names into Finnish; for example writer Alexis Stenvall changed his name to Aleksis Kivi (Aleksis Rock).Photo: Kimmo Mäntylä/Lehtikuva<p><p>Paikkala’s book Se tavallinen Virtanen (which translates roughly to “The Average Smith”) is an extensive study of Finnish surnames in the period 1850–1921 when many families first officially adopted hereditary surnames. During the Fennicisation movement of the early 20th century many Finns translated their former Swedish-language names into Finnish. Writer Alexis Stenvall changed his name to Aleksis Kivi, and the renowned painter Axel Waldemar Gallén became Akseli Gallen-Kallela.<p><p>But Paikkala enthusiastically explains that her work is not all about digging into dusty archives: “I often have to deal with email or phone enquiries when people are looking for the etymology of a surname, or feel they need a completely new surname.”<p><p>Some unusual surnames with obscure origins have strange meanings in modern Finnish, including Kiimamaa (land in heat), Patja (mattress), Makkara (sausage), Kaalinpää (cabbage head), Punkki (mite), Romu (junk), and Hikipää (sweaty head).<p><p>Some unusual surnames with obscure origins have strange meanings in modern Finnish, including Kaalinpää (cabbage head).Photo: Kimmo Mäntylä/Lehtikuva<p><p>According to Paikkala, a new trend is discernible among newlyweds. “Couples planning marriage look for a totally new surname to indicate the beginning of a new life. This phenomenon started in the 1990s after Finnish laws were changed to allow both women and men to choose their surname.”<p><p>However, upon marriage about 80 percent of Finnish women still assume their husband’s surname or combine their maiden name and their husband’s name. Combining Finnish surnames in this way opens up amusing possibilities. If Mr Pulska (fat) marries Miss Orava (squirrel), he might become Pulska-Orava (fat squirrel). And if Miss Nälkäinen (hungry), marries Mr Karhu (bear), she could become Nälkäinen-Karhu (hungry bear). <p><p>By Carina Chela and Fran Weaver, June 2011; updated July 2014<p><p>The rivals: Virtanen and Korhonen<p><p>The non-nen surnames<p><p>Past and present trends<p>", "time": "2014-07-21T08:28:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

The results of the 2009 PISA are announced in December 2010.<p><p>In 2006, when Finland hosted the EU presidency, Economist magazine described Finland as being “first in the World Economic Forum’s list of most competitive countries, second in its business-competitiveness index, first in the OECD’s world ranking of education performance; [and having the] second-highest share of R&amp;D spending in the European Union,” while pointing out that the Nordic nation is reversing its demographic decline with one of the highest fertility rates in Europe.<p><p>Finns are known for their honesty, and the country always places at or close to the top of the list of the world’s least corrupt countries, published annually by the Berlin-based organisation Transparency International.<p><p>Another strong point is technology. Finland’s mobile phone market is one of the world’s most developed. Ninety-eight percent of households have mobile phones. There are more mobile phones than fixed network subscriptions. It’s no surprise, then, that the world’s leading manufacturer of mobile devices, Nokia, was founded and is still headquartered in Finland. It’s estimated that 11 to 12 Nokia devices are sold every second.<p><p>Photo: Tekes/Pasi Hytti<p><p>Seventy-five percent of Finnish households own a personal computer, 70 percent have an internet connection and 62 percent broadband; 78 percent own a digital television.<p><p>Not only is Finland one of the leading countries in internet use, the Los Angeles Times wrote in June 2008 that Finland is the world’s safest internet country. Based on a study by anti-virus company McAfee, domains ending in “.fi” are the least likely to cause security problems for users.<p><p>Finland has also received accolades for its innovative use of the world wide web in its public library system, yet another area in which Finland holds world records. Finland has a literacy rate of 100 percent and the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita.<p><p>Finland has a high standard of living and one of the world’s best functioning welfare systems. Education and healthcare are virtually free and equality is not just a buzzword: Finland’s president (Tarja Halonen) and prime minister (Mari Kiviniemi) are women, and women ministers outnumber men in government, making Finland the most female-dominated government in the world.<p><p>Photo: Centre Party<p><p>Babies are well taken care of. In 2007, Finland’s infant mortality rate of 3.52 deaths for every 1,000 births was one of the lowest in the world according to the World Health Organisation. Paid maternity and paternity leaves are standard benefits, and organised childcare is largely paid for by the state.<p><p>On average, Finns are entitled to five weeks of paid holidays a year. And while they are avid travelers, many enjoy spending their holiday time in the Finnish archipelago, which is considered the biggest in the world when measured by the number of islands in it – more than 20,000. Finland is also known as “the land of a thousand lakes.” Actually, there are 187,888 lakes. The 338,000-square-kilometre country also has more islands than any other country in the world.<p><p>Forest covers 70 percent of Finland’s land area, the highest proportion in the world. It is not surprising that the country is one of the top exporters of forest products. In exports of paper and paperboard Finland is second in the world, after Canada. Many of the world’s eminent newspapers and magazines are produced on Finnish paper.<p><p>Finns have long excelled at sports, and set many world records in areas such as running, skiing and race car driving. In proportion to its population, Finland is the world’s second-most successful country in the Olympic medal statistics: from the Summer Olympics, Finland has taken home the most medals per capita. In motor racing, Kimi Räikkönen was the Formula One World Champion in 2007.<p><p>The arts scene is also generously represented by Finns. Among those well-known internationally are composer and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, currently the principal conductor and artistic advisor of the London’s Philharmonia Orchestra, and opera singers Monica Groop and Karita Mattila. Mattila’s appearance in Salome at New York’s Metropolitan Opera in 2004 caused a sensation and her subsequent performance in Katya Kabanova garnered the following praise in the New York press: “When the history of the Metropolitan Opera….is written, Karita Mattila will deserve her own chapter.”<p><p>And that’s just the tip of the Finnish achievement iceberg. The list goes on, but naturally, as Finns, we’re too modest to continue.<p><p>By Katja Pantzar, June 2008, updated September 2010<p><p>World-class achievements<p><p>You have our word<p><p>A leader in internet use<p><p>Quality of life<p><p>A few famous Finns<p>", "time": "2013-06-04T11:14:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

We talk to a couple who lived in New York’s Finntown in the 1950s.<p><p>In the late 1800s, Finns found their place in the world’s most famous collective of expatriates: New York. Driven to the US by job opportunities and the image of America as a cornucopia of wealth, they established working-class communities in Harlem and Brooklyn’s Sunset Park.<p><p>Finns constructed co-op buildings, opened Finnish-speaking businesses and established community centres, churches, newspapers and political groups. By the 1920s, New York was home to roughly 20,000 people who identified themselves as having Finnish heritage. Now the number has dwindled to 3,500.<p><p>The street sign on the corner of 40th Street and 8th Avenue in Brooklyn reads “Finlandia Street.”Photo: Laura Palotie<p><p>The first of New York’s two Finntowns was in East Harlem, where a stretch of 125th Street between Fifth Avenue and Harlem River was dotted with Finnish businesses during the first half of the 20th century. There were jewellery shops, clothing stores and restaurants as well as a bakery and a beauty parlour.<p><p>Several Finnish clubs and associations were established; the most notable was Fifth Avenue Hall on the corner of 127th Street and Fifth Avenue. Starting in 1917, it formed the headquarters of a local Finnish Socialist party, but many without political affiliation used its billiards room, library, restaurant and dance hall. Expats mingled here on weekends, and romances sparked; many met their future partners at community gatherings.<p><p>Among these couples were Anja and Mauno Laurila, who both moved to the US in the 1950s and met at a party organised by a mutual friend in Harlem. By the time Anja moved to New York, Fifth Avenue Hall had already closed, immigration was slowing down and Sunset Park had taken over as New York’s remaining Finntown; when the couple got married in 1958, they too relocated to Brooklyn.<p><p>In 2011, aided by the last remaining funds of Brooklyn-based Imatra Foundation, the couple chronicled Harlem’s Finnish history in a book entitled Memories of Finnish Harlem: 1888–1955.<p><p>Compiled from interviews with about ten former inhabitants of Finnish Harlem, the 48-page book forms a portrait of a self-sustaining community that assisted new arrivals in finding employment, was active in entrepreneurship and sustained a lively social scene with athletics, theatre activities and a church.<p><p>Finnish men worked in construction, in the military or on merchant ships, while women often found a career niche as housekeepers at wealthy local families. Anja, for example, worked for John D. Rockefeller, Jr.<p><p>Almost no visible traces of Harlem’s Finnish past remain, but many of the buildings that housed shops and community centres are still standing.<p><p>The building named Alku Toinen (Beginning II) dates back to 1916 and forms an emblem of immigration history.Photo: Laura Palotie<p><p>More obvious, if small, signs of a Finnish past are found in Brooklyn, where Finns built about 25 cooperative (resident-owned) housing complexes. The first Finnish-built co-ops in Sunset Park, named Alku I (Beginning I) and Alku Toinen (Beginning II), date back to 1916 and are the oldest nonprofit co-ops in New York. The entrance of Alku Toinen on 43rd Street has become an emblem of immigration history, mentioned in local newspapers.<p><p>The street sign on the corner of 40th Street and 8th Avenue reads “Finlandia Street,” but no Finnish businesses or organisations remain in the neighbourhood.<p><p>According to Mika Roinila, a US-based geography professor who specialises in Finnish migration, Finnish cultural communities in New York have dwindled because of a cultural tendency for assimilation.<p><p>“There are a lot more Polish and Russian Americans than Finnish Americans, and they are able to hold on to their identities better,” he says. “However, there are also a lot more Americans with German ancestry, but you don’t see a lot of German neighbourhoods out there. They have assimilated, like the Finns.”<p><p>These days, many Finns who come to the US participate in high-tech fields rather than blue-collar jobs. According to sociologists, white working-class communities are more likely than middle-class communities to retain connections to their cultural roots. Roinila adds that in many Finnish immigrant families, parents encouraged their American-born children to speak English from a young age in order to assimilate better.<p><p>“These days it’s very difficult to get young people involved, and us older Finns are starting to get tired,” says Anja Laurila. “The big difference is that young people have their own lives and little interest in being involved. Part of the reason is that in America you have to work very hard and the commutes are long, and those things eat into your personal time.” <p><p>By Laura Palotie, November 2011<p><p>A home in Harlem<p><p>Brooklyn sunset<p>", "time": "2011-11-24T12:33:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Taking place in Oulu in 2011, the event forms a unique opportunity to hear Ahtisaari’s insights into peace mediation and participate in an open discussion on current societal challenges and conflict solving.<p><p>The special day aims to increase awareness about peace mediation throughout society and encourage Finns to recognise the usefulness of a Finnish style of communication, emphasising negotiation and mediation. For Ahtisaari, visits to two Oulu schools precede the afternoon discussion at Oulu University.<p><p>At the CMI tenth anniversary event, former President Ahtisaari, current President Tarja Halonen and the other dignitaries danced in the name of peace.Photo: Tuomo Manninen/graalfoto<p><p>In spring 2011, the Ahtisaari Day concept kicked off when big names such as Kofi Annan gathered in Helsinki for a seminar that marked the tenth anniversary of Crisis Management Initiative (CMI), the nongovernmental organisation Ahtisaari founded for peace mediation. The date for the first national Ahtisaari Day was set for November, the month that includes the name day for Martti in the Finnish calendar.<p><p>Under the auspices of CMI, Ahtisaari and his colleagues participate in conflict resolution all over the world. “When the announcement was made [that Ahtisaari had won the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize], we began receiving 30 requests a day for my time, from Finland and abroad,” says the former president.<p><p>CMI carefully reviews each request. “It’s totally impossible to say yes to everything, because there’s hardly any conflict area where somebody is not knocking on CMI’s door,” he says. His reputation, meanwhile, helps open doors for CMI: “Because of my background, I think that in many cases we can count on support which other organisations don’t necessarily have. It’s easier for us to talk to governments – and it’s not only me; my colleagues have established those relationships.”<p><p>On a trip for a project called “Dialogue on possibilities for conflict resolution in Afghanistan,” several CMI representatives had the chance to see local kite flying traditions during a free moment in Kabul, Afghanistan Photo: Meeri-Maria Jaarva<p><p>In interviews, Ahtisaari often refers to the peace process he oversaw in 2005 in the Indonesian province of Aceh, halting some 30 years of hostilities between the Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian government. He notes that, before the solution, “If the government and the people hadn’t both wanted to make peace, nobody could have facilitated the process.”<p><p>The deal itself was achieved in record time – six months – but CMI continues to participate in follow-up work to this day. The final handshake is actually more of a beginning than an end: “You have to try to create the framework for a new society,” Ahtisaari says, “which would make it possible to avoid all the atrocities that have taken place over the years – a totally new setting.”<p><p>Just a few of the other areas where Ahtisaari has been active include the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s, and Namibia, for which he was UN commissioner and then UN special representative from the late 1970s until 1990. In 1989 and ’90 he headed the UN operation when the country achieved independence.<p><p>Emmanuel Jal, a South Sudanese rapper who used to be a child soldier, chats with Ahtisaari prior to performing at CMI’s tenth anniversary. Photo: Cornelis van Voorthuizen/photocornelis.com<p><p>“In negotiations, it has been rather easy to sense what people are actually thinking,” says Ahtisaari. He attributes this to his background: Vyborg, where he was born in 1937, is located in eastern Karelia. Much of the region became part of the Soviet Union during the Second World War and remains Russian today. “It was a disaster because 400,000 of us had to flee Karelia to the rest of Finland.”<p><p>Ahtisaari’s family, like many others, found refuge with relatives and host families. He thinks of himself as an “eternally displaced person,” and feels “a lot of sympathy for those who have gone through a similar experience.”<p><p>“You develop a sort of sixth sense,” he says. “I’ve been very lucky – I only had to move within my own country, and that’s much easier than having to leave your country.”<p><p>Finland’s Karelian experience, as well as the Finns’ direct and open approach to problem solving and surmounting challenges, help shape the Finnish style of conflict resolution, and will surely form part of the discussion for many Ahtisaari Days to come.<p><p>By Peter Marten, November 2011<p><p>Connecting with peace mediation<p><p>Final handshake, new beginning<p><p>The Karelian experience’s legacy<p><p><p>", "time": "2015-03-30T11:01:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

By comparison, in the countries with the poorest results in the study, only every 20th student achieved top science grades.<p><p>However, Finns spent less time than the OECD average on studying science subjects and significantly less time than students in other countries that performed well in the study. The report, which was published in the spring of 2009, shows that girls and boys had very similar levels of achievement. The report analysis is based on material from the 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).<p><p>One particularly encouraging result was the fact that social differences between young people in Finland, as in Japan and Austria, do not appear to have much influence on their performance in science studies. More than one in three young Finns from disadvantaged social backgrounds performed well in school. Social differences are very visible in schools in many other OECD countries.<p><p>Angel Gurria, Secretary-General of OECD.© OECD<p><p>The OECD study also measured the young people’s interest in science. It became clear that interest in these subject areas is not at a top level, even for those who are good at it: 40 percent of top performers are not interested in a science-related career and 45 percent are not interested in continuing their studies in this area after finishing school.<p><p>This phenomenon also exists in Finland, although it is more moderate than in OECD countries on average. This may be due to the fact that in Finland girls perform at a consistently high level in all subject areas, including science, meaning that there are many of them in the top performer group. However, science is not a favourite choice of women when it comes to higher education.<p><p>The study showed that approximately half of young people do not know what kind of career prospects are opened up by a strong grasp of science.<p><p>OECD secretary general Angel Gurría pointed out that this may pose a problem in the society of the future, which will be very dependent on technology expertise. Schools should focus on making science studies pleasant and enjoyable for students, and young people should be aware of the career prospects that science provides.<p><p>Finland’s economic success on world markets in recent decades has occurred in the field of high technology, which is closely related to science, and young people clearly take this into consideration when choosing what to study.

I’m joining him on his round, delivering letters, newspapers and bills to dozens of families living in this beautiful part of Finland’s labyrinthine southwestern archipelago.<p><p>Almost every home subscribes to a Swedish-language newspaper. Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>“I deliver the post five times weekly all year round,” explains Simberg. “To make this possible in all conditions I need many different kinds of transportation, including a hydrocopter, a snowmobile, an all-terrain-vehicle, a kick-sledge, skis and ice-skates!”<p><p>Some islands are only inhabited during the summer, but even in winter the Finnish postal service pledges to provide daily deliveries wherever people live. Today, with the sun shining over the myriad green islands dotting the blue Baltic, Simberg’s round feels like a pleasure cruise. But when blizzards blow or temperatures plummet below minus 20 degrees Celsius (four below zero Fahrenheit), taking the post to the islands’ year-round inhabitants becomes a heroic one-man struggle against the elements.<p><p>Small postboxes are conveniently nailed to the wooden jetties by every island home, but as we approach, the locals invariably stroll down to the shore to greet Simberg. “I might be the only person they see for weeks,” he says. “I often find myself providing social services as well as news and post.”<p><p>On remote islands the arrival of the post is a social event, and Simberg is often invited for coffee and a chat. Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Thanks to his reputation as a willing handyman, Simberg is often asked by islanders to help with repair work – or to deliver extra goods ranging from groceries to fridges or even hot tubs. The archipelago postman’s daily visits are particularly vital for the islands’ older residents. Once Simberg had to urgently ferry an ailing islander to the mainland and call an ambulance to meet her.<p><p>“I feel privileged to be part of the islanders’ lives and provide this connection to the outside world – though my round can take a long time in the summer when everyone wants to offer coffee and have a chat!” he says.<p><p>In an age when public services are increasingly privatised and expected to make profits, Simberg hopes the post will continue to reach isolated communities: “The islanders strongly defend their right to healthcare, schools and the post, and archipelago people are good fighters!”<p><p>Summer or winter, the Finnish postal service provides daily deliveries wherever people live. Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Almost every home receives the local Swedish-language newspaper. Though 90 percent of local residents are Swedish-speaking Finns, recently Finnish-speakers have increasingly been acquiring holiday homes in the islands. Some natives regret that this is changing local cultural life, but Simberg welcomes the newcomers: “Without the holiday-makers the islands could become depopulated as young locals move to the mainland to study and work.”<p><p>In his previous life on the mainland, Simberg, 61, was a well-known actor who appeared in many theatre, film and TV productions. Today he clearly enjoys the slower pace of life in this scenic archipelago, encountering wild geese, seals and eagles on his daily round: “In my job every day is different. I’m lucky that it fits in with my other main livelihood, building wooden boats.”<p><p>After seven years plying these waters 300 days a year, usually alone, Simberg credibly claims to know every single rock, but he remains safety-conscious even in fair weather: “I always wear my life-vest, and use a dead man’s grip that will stop the boat if I fall out.

A broad range of Finnish and international eco-friendly brands is on offer, whether you’re in the market for design, clothing or giftware.<p><p>Consumers today are increasingly environmentally aware; they want to ensure that their prospective purchases have been ethically and ecologically made. Buying local, a movement that started with food, has spread to other industries, as has the idea of investing in quality rather than disposable mass-manufactured goods. The latter is a concept that took root in Finland more than half a century ago.<p><p>The Finnish capital (population half a million, 1.3 million in the greater Helsinki area) offers a great selection of boutiques and shops with a decidedly green approach. As many are concentrated in clusters in the downtown core, you can easily make a walking tour.<p><p>End-of-season sales take place in the January–February and July–August periods, after two of the most important holidays on the Finnish calendar: Christmas and Midsummer.<p><p>Made in Finland: IvanaHelsinki was the first-ever Finnish name in the prestigious Paris Fashion Week.Photo: Tuomas Peltomaa<p><p>In the past decade, Helsinki has landed on the global shopping map for style-conscious and sustainability-conscious travellers. Many home-grown talents have made their mark internationally.<p><p>Paris-based designer Anna Ruohonen received an ecological award from the Finnish edition of Elle magazine for her custom-order clothing for men and women, and Paola Suhonen’s IvanaHelsinki, an ethically made-in-Finland label, was the first-ever Finnish name to be invited to the prestigious Paris Fashion Week.<p><p>Globe Hope, now with two stores in Helsinki (Mannerheimintie 22–24 and Aleksanterinkatu 28) is one of the city’s best examples of consumer sustainability. Everything in the shop has been made from material headed for the garbage dump: Computer keyboards are retuned as key chains, old zippers as attractive brooches and vinyl records as fruit bowls.<p><p>Globe Hope is one of Finland’s premier eco brands, which reworks old hospital textiles, uniforms and vintage materials into clothing, bags, shoes and accessories.<p><p>Just off of Fredrikinkatu, OVVN (Iso Roobertinkatu 17–19) showcases clothing and accessories by hip young Finnish designers including Miia Halmesmaa and Hankala. Many of the items are made from recycled fabrics and are handmade, one-off pieces.<p><p>On nearby Uudenmaankatu you’ll find IvanaHelsinki (Uudenmaankatu 15) the clothing and accessories label started by one of Finland’s best-known designers, Paola Suhonen, and her sister Pirjo long before sustainability became a buzzword. Their philosophy is based on operating ethically and causing the least possible harm to the environment.<p><p>There’s an argument to be made for investing in high-quality goods, items that are considered to be luxurious because of their cost and craftsmanship. Well-made items last longer; in the long run they can be less expensive. For example, one pair of well-fitting quality shoes that last can be less expensive than several pairs of cheap, ill-fitting shoes.<p><p>The youthful shops that line Erottajankatu include My o My (Erottajankatu 9 courtyard), which has a clever interior design and carries clothing by Alexander McQueen, Tsumori Chisato, Vanessa Bruno and Pedro Garcia, as well as giftware and accessories.<p><p>Beam (Erottajankatu 15–17) stocks APC, Acne, Helmut Lang and Marc by Marc Jacobs, while Urban a* (Erottajankatu 1–3) carries many quality Scandinavian brands, such as Malene Birger, Bruuns Bazaar and Stylesnob, and their own line of handmade jewellery at reasonable prices.<p><p>In addition to a shop, Design Forum Finland is also home to a gallery featuring items such as Kirsti Taiviola’s Aarre table lamp.Photo: Liisa Valonen/Design Forum Finland<p><p>Also on Erottajakatu, which is part of the city’s official Design District, you’ll find Design Forum Finland (Erottajankatu 7). DFF carries a wide range of the newest in design, from giftware to items such as notebooks, lamps and jewellery.<p><p>Down the street and around the corner, there’s a concentration of shops that reflect Finland’s strong design heritage along the Esplanade, Helsinki’s most picturesque and touristy boulevard.<p><p>Well before environmentalism became an international trend, architect and designer Alvar Aalto (1898–1976) – Finland’s Frank Lloyd Wright – and his wife Aino were among the cofounders of Artek (Eteläesplanadi 18) in 1935. They designed furniture and houseware based on the idea of functionality and timeless aesthetics. Many of the couple’s designs are still in production today.<p><p>These days everything that Artek undertakes has a strong green approach. British design whiz Tom Dixon, Artek’s creative director, has been involved in numerous projects including a sustainable line of bamboo furniture (called Bambu) and 2nd Cycle, whereby Artek re-collected and reissued old Artek pieces. Celebrated Finnish industrial designer Harri Koskinen recently created a series of durable water-resistant bags out of old sails for the SavetheC organisation to encourage boaters to recycle.<p><p>Across the street at another Finnish design classic, glass and cookware manufacturer Iittala (Pohjoisesplanadi 25) supports a veritably green idea with their “Against throwawayism” slogan. Invest in a well-made design classic such as a set of drinking glasses that will bring you daily enjoyment, last almost forever, and retain its value rather than buying cheap, poor quality drinking glasses that need to be replaced every year or two.<p><p>On the same side of the Esplanade is Marimekko (Pohjoisesplanadi 33). Marimekko, founded in 1951 and one of Finland’s biggest international design hits, has long held the philosophy that high quality, longevity and a strong design ideology are integral to its home textiles, clothing and accessories.<p><p>And finally, for shoppers who want a one-stop solution, Stockmann (Aleksanterinkatu 52), known affectionately as the Harrods of Helsinki, features eight floors of department store shopping under one roof, including many of the brands mentioned above, such as Tiia Vanhatapio, Iittala and Marimekko.<p><p>Left Foot Company (Eteläesplanadi 8) custom-makes men’s footwear based on a foot scan.

But still, there’s a reason to rock ‘n’ roll: Finland has been declared the world’s most prosperous nation.<p><p>The 2009 Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI), published by London-based thinktank Legatum, puts Finland in first place overall; the previous year it came in third. [Editor’s update: In addition, the Economist magazine’s Economist Intelligence Unit places Helsinki at number six on its 2010 Liveability Index of the world’s most liveable cities. It’s one of only two European cities in the top ten, which is dominated by Canada (Vancouver took the gold) and Australia.]<p><p>The LPI ranks countries in nine different subindexes: economic fundamentals; entrepreneurship and innovation; democratic institutions; education; health; safety and security; governance; personal freedom; and social capital.<p><p>Out of 104 countries, 90 percent of the global population, Finland was the only one to make the top ten in every category. It placed second in governance and in safety and security, and came third in education. Switzerland was second in the overall rankings, followed by Finland’s Nordic neighbours – Sweden, Denmark and Norway. Also in the top ten were Australia and New Zealand, Canada and the US, and the Netherlands.<p><p>The LPI’s creators explain that they utilise ”a holistic definition of prosperity” that includes both ”material wealth” and ”measures of happiness and quality of life”. They note that ”the most prosperous nations in the world are not necessarily those that have only a high GDP, but are those that also have happy, healthy, and free citizens”.<p><p>In other words, ”happiness is opportunity, good health, relationships and the freedom to choose who you want to be”, they say. For everyone out there who has been wondering how to achieve happiness, the equation is that simple.<p><p>Legatum points out that while many of the highly ranked nations have long histories of prosperity, ”several others that not long ago were afflicted with poverty, oppression, and unhappiness” are relatively high on the list. ”History is not destiny,” as the report puts it.<p><p>It’s an honour to achieve first place in the LPI and an affirmation that Finland is doing something – many things – right. ”Prosperous countries are strong across the board,” says the report, meaning that all the subindexes are interlinked. In order to build and maintain prosperity and reach the top, countries cannot ignore any of these ”foundations of prosperity”.<p><p> <p><p>By Peter Marten, October 2009, updated February 2010<p><p>Keys to happiness<p><p>Links:<p>", "time": "2010-02-15T14:55:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Good choice! Foreign students at Finnish universities highly recommend the experience.<p><p>Deciding your field of study can be daunting. The stakes are even higher if you decide to obtain your degree abroad. The risks can seem big, but the adventure and the rewards can be great as well. Studying is highly valued in Finland, and that’s a perfect starting point.<p><p>Finland forms an attractive place to study for many reasons. Students value the high quality of life, the stable yet dynamic economy, the good living accommodations and the safe, laidback atmosphere. And let’s not forget the strong connection to nature that Finns treasure.<p><p>Francisco Socal from Porto Alegre, Brazil, who interned as a computer engineer in Oulu, northern Finland, praises the ease and safety of getting around, and the bicycle-friendliness of the cities. Luis Alfredo Chavez Cabrera from Mexico had narrowed down his options to Argentina, Chile and Finland, and ended up in the North after reading an article that rated Finland as an excellent European growth economy.<p><p>Studying should be about acquiring skills for life and a solid building block for a future career. What do foreign students think of the quality of their studies in Finland?<p><p>Fatih Tokan from Turkey knew little of Finnish culture or people when he arrived as an exchange student, but fell in love with the range of choice at his uni. “It is easy and really student-oriented – you can choose from tons of different faculties and take courses from other universities, which is really great,” he says. No surprise, then, that he carried on to complete his degree in Helsinki after his exchange.<p><p>One important thing to keep in mind when comparing different options is the difference between the “regular” universities, business schools and the universities of applied science. Rabindra Nepal, from Nepal, who studied at the Arcada University of Applied Sciences, recounts that courses there are “very work-life–oriented.”<p><p>Not that studies at the University of Helsinki, Finland’s largest uni, aren’t job-oriented, but the focus is more theoretical and the schedules even more flexible. Danish political science student Sören Berg Rasmussen points out, “I think it’s important for people thinking about coming to study here that it will require a lot of independence”.<p><p>When they hear the word “university”, many Finns think of the University of Helsinki’s main building, designed by Carl Ludwig Engel and completed in 1832.Photo: Ida Pimenoff/Helsinki University<p><p>One of the best things about education in Finland is that it is cheap. Students enrolled in a full-time degree programme pay no tuition fees. The average cost of living in Finland is high, though comparable to the rest of Europe.<p><p>Minimum living expenses for a single student range from 600 to 800 euros a month depending on cost of accommodation, healthcare and other expenses. A foreign student who has lived in Finland for at least two years for some other purpose than studying and has permanent resident status may apply for student financial aid.<p><p>Adapting to new surroundings and a different culture is surely the biggest challenge to enjoying life in a new environment. Anil Palikhe from Kathmandu, Nepal knows that all Finns are not as shy as the stereotypes would lead you to believe. Nevertheless his initial reaction was that Finns seem to “hide like turtles”. Andrew Nestingen from the United States doesn’t see much difference in behaviour and maintains that people are exactly as quiet on a bus in Seattle as they are in Helsinki.<p><p>Everyone agrees that you can get by perfectly well in Finland speaking English. However, if you really want soak up the essence of Finnish culture, learning some of the local lingo is recommended. Then at least you’ll be able to evaluate whether Frédéric from France, who volunteered at an afternoon club for children in Turku, is right when summing up Finnish people as the hobbits from JRR Tolkien’s Lord of The Rings. You know, those carefree inhabitants of Middle Earth who live peaceful, stress-free lives in cosy houses.<p><p>This is just a first glance of the possibilities.

That’s part of the philosophy at a “forest daycare” on the edge of Helsinki, encouraging skills and values that stem from the Finnish love of nature.<p><p>Finland is famous for its classroom performance; the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) have repeatedly ranked Finnish children as top performers in school. But not all learning happens in the classroom. We visit an unusual daycare in the Helsinki neighbourhood of Vanha Kaupunki (Old City).<p><p>As its name suggests, Vanha Kaupunki is the oldest quarter of Helsinki, where the original settlement of fishermens’ cabins huddled along the shore and around a wooden church on a bluff overlooking the rapids.<p><p>The area where the daycare is located is also home to a former power station (centre, now a museum), as well as modern buildings and a nature preserve.Photo: Anthony Shaw<p><p>Nowadays the area is home to hundreds of flats in new blocks and in reconditioned industrial buildings, all of which meet stringent specifications for energy saving. Behind them lies Viikki Nature Reserve, especially favoured by migrating birds and their spotters in April and May, and a riot of burnished, reedy colour in the autumn. The neighbourhood also features a scattering of venerable wood-clad houses, looking rather plain compared to the stylish glass and stainless steel of the new architecture behind.<p><p>One wooden building stands out, with a towering maple tree shading a yard that rings with eager young voices.<p><p>This is Mörrintupa (Wood-elf’s Cottage), the daily retreat for 28 local children where they can – and indeed must – while away their daytime hours outdoors in their “forest daycare.” Starting early every morning, come wind come snow (and it surely will in winter), the house and yard form the daytime home for two groups, with all activities based outside in the yard or the local forest.<p><p>Saima, Iris, Minttu, Silvia and Grethe gather at the edge of the yard. The daycare is a stone’s throw from the Viikki Nature Reserve.Photo: Anthony Shaw<p><p>It was Swede Gösta Frohm who pioneered the educational role of learning through direct first-hand contact with nature in the “rain or shine” preschools. In Vanha Kaupunki and nearby, Taiga Child, a private company, runs three kindergartens with support from Suomen Latu, a nationwide association for recreational sports and outdoor activities. The concept, known as “at home in nature,” is embraced by young urban families who want their children to retain the strong contact with their natural environment that the parents themselves experienced as kids.<p><p>For the children the first priority is play, which of course comes easily to everyone in the wild. Daily walks to the local forest, the river or the nature reserve are filled with games and opportunities for play. But there are also duties and routines to be followed, which can be tougher on the children in this outdoor location.<p><p>Despite ongoing urbanisation, there are still a lot of trees in this rapidly changing corner of the city, 3.5 kilometres from the heart of Helsinki. The reed beds lining the eastern shore of the bay run for many kilometres through the nature reserve. Just over the fence from the daycare, fishermen cast for salmon and trout in the river rapids. And in autumn the colours are splendid, furbishing endless materials for these children make the most of their artistic value – just like their grandparents did.<p><p>By Anthony Shaw, October 2011<p><p>At home in nature<p>", "time": "2015-01-16T08:41:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

At Moose Manor, Finland’s first and only moose-based tourist attraction, visitors can meet, feed and pet moose before enjoying tasty meals filled with local ingredients – including moose meat.<p><p>Bull moose Jorma proudly waves his stately crown of antlers as he eagerly strides over to browse on the leafy branches we offer him in the woodland corral behind Moose Manor. Female moose Annikki is warier, making a mock charge before leading her leggy calf Suvi away to a secluded corner of their enclosure.<p><p>“Our three adult moose have all come from zoos, as in Finland it’s illegal to take wild animals into captivity, but our two calves, Laila and Suvi, were born here,” explains Susanna Partio, who set up Moose Manor in 2008 on an old farmstead at Jämsä in central Finland.<p><p>Moose Manor is a family business. Susanna, an experienced chef, runs the kitchen, while her son Paavo looks after the animals and guides visitors.<p><p>Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Moose eat up to 40 kilogrammes of food each day. “We’ve made friends among local landowners by clearing their willow thickets to get branches to feed our moose,” says Susanna. “Sometimes we also feed them apples, potatoes or hay to reproduce their natural seasonal diet, and as a result our animals have all stayed healthy.”<p><p>Moose can quite easily get used to people, though their limited attention span makes it practically impossible to train them for any useful work. “Looking after moose isn’t too hard though – except in the October rutting season, when the males don’t even eat, and can only think of one thing!” adds Paavo.<p><p>The Partios are clearly attached to their unusual “pets,” and keen to explain their distinct personalities to visitors. “Our oldest male, Matti-Esko, escaped a couple of years ago, but he really didn’t know how to behave in the forest with the wild moose. When he eventually came home, tired and skinny, he licked me all over my face,” remembers Susanna.<p><p>Moose Manor is a popular winter destination for holiday-makers based at the nearby Himos ski resort, including many Russian, Dutch and German visitors. In summer most of the guests are Finnish and Russian tourists. “The chance to see moose close-up is the main attraction, but almost everyone stays to dine in our restaurant too,” says Susanna.<p><p>Moose Manor’s menu includes moose meat from local hunters.Photo courtesy of Moose Manor<p><p>The kitchen serves traditional Finnish fare including locally sourced forest mushrooms, wild berries, woodland herbs and lake fish, as well as moose meat. The latter is supplied fresh by local hunters in the autumn and a supply is kept in the freezer for the rest of the year. “Though our own moose will never be sold as meat, we think it’s natural to eat moose meat, and people should understand where their food comes from,” says Susanna.<p><p>After savouring Moose Manor’s braised moose meat with buttery mashed potatoes, lingonberry sauce and pickled cucumbers, we head out to the corral where a young Finnish moose-fanatic, Anni, is lovingly stroking her new friend’s snout. “Matti-Esko is my favourite. He’s so big but very friendly, and his antlers feel so funny with their soft, warm covering,” she says delightedly.<p><p>Moose crossing the highway can cause car accidents.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>• Finland’s moose population numbered almost 100,000 at the end of 2010, according to surveys conducted by the Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute.

The 420-metre deep access tunnel to the repository is already excavated.<p><p>If X, then Y. This is the Finnish view, at least, when it comes to the final disposal of nuclear waste: X equals waste created by nuclear power plants, and Y equals barriers to prevent particles from spent fuel rods from reaching the biosphere.<p><p>Forty-one countries use nuclear energy, but Finland is the first nation in the world to line up a final storage place. They’re calling it Onkalo, which means “cave” in Finnish. Plans also exist in the US and in Sweden, which is cooperating with Finland in these matters.<p><p>Back in the early 1980s, Finland’s nuclear power plant operators realised that the nuclear waste had to go somewhere. The country has nuclear power facilities in two locations: Olkiluoto on the west coast and Loviisa on the south coast.<p><p>Enter here to follow the access tunnel that winds gradually down through the rock to a depth of more than 420 metres.Photo: Posiva Oy<p><p>“We were pragmatic, and even then knew that if we produced radioactive waste, we would also be responsible for disposing of it safely,” says Timo Äikäs, vice president of Posiva Ltd, which has been in charge of Finland’s project for a future disposal facility since 1995.<p><p>Until 1996, spent fuel from Finnish nuclear power plants was transported to Russia for reprocessing. In 1994 the Finnish Parliament had ruled to prohibit importing and exporting radioactive waste and reprocessing nuclear waste abroad. The solution was to transport highly radioactive waste from TVO’s Olkiluoto facilities and from Fortum to temporary storage in Loviisa, 400 kilometres away. After cooling down for 50 years, it will be buried forever deep in the granite.<p><p>In the future, the spent fuel from both energy companies will be sent to Onkalo, situated on the Olkiluoto peninsula on the idyllic Gulf of Bothnia, in the nuclear-energy-friendly town of Eurajoki.<p><p>Posiva Ltd, a subsidiary of the two energy companies, began construction of Onkalo in 2004. However, they started searching for a suitable location as early as 1983, performing geological, hydrological and geochemical investigations all over Finland.<p><p>“The only option we have in Finland is the crystalline bedrock,” says Äikäs. “A long search, which lasted until 2000, verified that the locations we tested are all quite similar scientifically and technically. They all meet the conditions for safe storage.<p><p>“A nuclear power plant and infrastructure already existed on the Olkiluoto peninsula. We also knew that the majority of spent fuel accumulates there, so the transport distance would be short. Loviisa, on the other hand, produces far less radioactive waste.”<p><p>The spent fuel will be placed inside a graphite cast iron honeycomb (right) contained in a copper canister (left).Photo: Posiva Oy<p><p>The disposal is based on a multibarrier system of technical solutions: Pure copper canisters contain honeycombs made of graphite cast iron. The canisters are surrounded with a waterproof bentonite clay buffer, as well as the natural barrier of stable granite, which is not temperature-sensitive.<p><p>There the radioactivity will be held in check for at least 100,000 years, surrounded by bentonite clay inside a shaft drilled and blasted through the granite to a depth of 420 metres.<p><p>Could the barriers withstand a new ice age? Humanity has yet to succeed in building something that will last forever. The Fennoscandian bedrock is, however, among the oldest geological formations in Europe.<p><p>“Let me think how old the rock is here,” says Posiva geologist Kimmo Kemppainen when asked about the safety of Finnish granite. “It has survived almost 1.8 million years. This is a fairly long period, during which several deformation phases have produced no huge changes.”<p><p>Four of the barriers that prevent the nuclear waste from being released.Photo: Posiva Oy<p><p>What’s next? So far the Onkalo access tunnel has been completed, and currently serves as a sort of underground laboratory. Soon the two ventilation shafts and employee shaft will be complete. Planning permission for the actual repository is set for 2012.<p><p>Next on the list are the encapsulation plant and the first of the deposition tunnels where the canisters will be housed. If all goes well for Posiva, they will request an operating license from the government in 2018 and the repository will open in 2020.<p><p>The estimated total cost of the facility equals three billion euros. It will accept nuclear waste for at least 100 years before being sealed forever. Time will tell whether Onkalo remains the only facility of its kind; Fennovoima has now joined TVO and Fortum as a nuclear power plant operator and must, within the next six years, either form an agreement with Posiva or submit plans for its own final disposal facility.<p><p> <p><p>By Rebecca Libermann, September 2011<p><p>Right location<p><p>Multiple safety barriers<p><p>Ready by 2020<p>", "time": "2011-12-27T10:14:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Such schemes might be shunned on financial markets as risky investments, but for us as a government-owned international financial institution with a high credit rating, financial performance and lucrative interest rates are not the main issue,” explains NIB communications director Jukka Ahonen.<p><p>NIB mainly finances projects in the Nordic and Baltic regions, targeting sustainable growth and the use of clean technologies in areas such as wastewater treatment. Many projects aim to increase the use of renewable energy, including geothermal power in Iceland, wind power in Denmark and Sweden, and wood energy in Finland.<p><p>NIB helps finance environmentally friendly public transport such as the westward extension of Helsinki’s metro rail system.Photo: Kimmo Mäntylä/Lehtikuva<p><p>NIB also provides loans to finance the expansion of environmentally friendly public transport services such as the trolleybus system in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Ahonen adds that, closer to home, NIB recently granted a 30-year loan of 120 million euros to Finland’s largest current infrastructure project – the westward extension into Espoo of Helsinki’s metro rail system, which will grow by 14 kilometres and seven new stations. “The first West Metro trains should depart in 2015, easing congestion and reducing fuel consumption in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area by carrying more than 100,000 passengers daily,” he says.<p><p>NIB was founded by the Nordic countries in 1975, and the Baltic countries joined in 2005. Member countries provide capital in proportion to their gross national income. In addition to providing the bank with a home, Finland subscribes to almost 18 percent of NIB’s total authorised capital of more than six million euros.<p><p>The Nordic Environmental Finance Corporation, NIB’s next-door neighbour in Helsinki’s Nordic financial hub, funds environmental projects in northwest Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic countries.<p><p>“We provide loans or share capital for financially viable investments that use proven clean technologies to improve waste management and wastewater treatment, reduce air pollution, increase the use of renewable energy and promote clean processes,” says NEFCO communications manager Mikael Sjövall. “When making financing decisions we weigh up investment costs against expected emission reductions.”<p><p>One of NEFCO’s main aims is to clean up the Baltic Sea.Photo: Niklas Sjöblom/taivasalla.net<p><p>NEFCO’s two main aims are to combat climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce pollution in the Baltic Sea. To reduce marine pollution it is often more cost-effective for the Nordic countries to fund improvements in industrial facilities and sewage plants in other countries in the Baltic Sea catchment area, since the worst point sources of pollution at home have already been effectively cleaned up.<p><p>Sjövall describes an agricultural project funded by NEFCO in rural Estonia where manure from cattle and poultry farms is being converted into biogas for energy use. “This project reduces emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane, provides renewable energy for local use, gives farmers a new source of income and also reduces emissions of nutrients into local rivers and the Baltic Sea, so it’s really a win-win scheme all round,” he says.<p><p>NEFCO also runs the 165-million-euro NEFCO Carbon Fund, which invests in renewable energy projects around the world and is funded by energy companies who gain emission reduction unit credits in return.<p><p>The Nordic Development Fund, a multilateral development finance institution set up by the governments of Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland, also focuses on climate-friendly projects. “For most of its 20-year history, NDF provided soft loans totalling approximately one billion euros for many kinds of development projects, but today our mandate involves providing grants for projects that promote climate change mitigation and adaptation in low-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America,” says NDF country programme manager Hannu Eerola.<p><p>“One of NDF’s important instruments today supports renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia through the Mekong Energy and Environment Programme which was initiated by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland and is jointly financed by Finland and NDF,” explains Eerola.

It’s totally understandable why it’s always at the top of the PISA survey. Students also encounter reality here. You can let yourself go a little and be creative, and I find that makes learning fun.”<p><p>Pilar Díaz (left) of Spain bonded with the locals over a barbeque in Turku.Photo: Pilar Díaz (Erasmus student, Turku)<p><p>But there are also downsides. People who come from abroad are often not used to small classes and mellow teaching staff, as is the norm in Finland. The relationship between lecturers and students is more formal in other countries – more demanding. “We have specially organised classes for exchange students,” says Leandra, “so you can get to feel like you’re stuck in an ivory tower, where the teachers make everything super-easy and only ask the minimum of you.”<p><p>This criticism is more often heard from European students. At the same time, exchange students are not taught separately in all subjects.<p><p>The first-ever opinion poll among foreign students, conducted at the end of 2010 as part of an international comparison of 23 Finnish education institutions, showed that 89 percent of foreign students in “The Land of a Thousand Lakes” had good experiences.<p><p>They especially liked the high-tech equipment at the unis and technical colleges. At the same time, the high cost of living can cause serious problems for students from less wealthy countries with low stipends and families that can’t help them out.<p><p>Many visitors are surprised and delighted to learn that you can walk across the ocean near Helsinki and many other locations in wintertime.Photo: Jakub Libiszewski/Erasmus student / UC London<p><p>In many countries exchange students keep mainly with their own kind, and there’s little contact with the natives. And in Finland students can experience challenges connecting with their Finnish counterparts.<p><p>“I never thought the difference between Germans and Finns was so big when it comes to shyness and protecting their private lives,” Leandra says. “I often felt like I came across as pushy, when I was just being my normal, cheerful, energetic self.”<p><p>Marianne from Namibia agrees, and says with a chuckle: “You know that you’ve acclimatised to Finland when you think someone who smiles at you in the street is drunk, mad or American. Social norms are different where I come from.”<p><p>Deanna from Tennessee also finds the Finns a little reserved. “It’s difficult to get close to a Finn, but once they warm up to you, they’re very nice, sincere and trustworthy. I find it inspiring to be with Finns. They’re much calmer than Americans, and they do what they say they will.”<p><p>And then there’s the weather. Many exchange students arrive in Finland in the middle of winter, and start their time skidding around Helsinki’s streets in shoes with no grip and shivering in a jacket that’s too thin. That’s how it was for Sarah: “I was totally stunned by the weather. In Tanzania it was around 40 degrees, and here it was all snow and ice.”<p><p>You never know who you might run into in the Finnish countryside. Canadian Sareena McDonald conversed with a cow in Sysmä.Photo: Sareena McDonald<p><p>Putting aside all coolness in the climate and the people, most exchange students don’t regret their time in Finland at all.<p><p>Sabine from Austria counts off the things that she loves about Finland: “The people, the food, the wonderful countryside, the impressive flora and fauna, the fact that Finland is a pioneer in the protection of nature and water, in gender policy, in healthy school meals and so much more.” She adds, “I’d like to come here again – not to study, but to spend my summer holidays.”<p><p>“Yes, yes, and again yes! I’d absolutely love to come again,” says Marianne from Namibia. “This country offers so many opportunities, and there’s so much to discover.” Almost all the Metropolia students I asked were unanimous: studying in Finland is fun!<p><p>By Rebecca Libermann, August 2011<p><p>Students from all over the world<p><p>Mood meter<p><p>Culture and climate shock<p><p>Finland is fun<p>", "time": "2011-08-25T10:47:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Eat Finland! - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/eat-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finnish culinary culture is infused with the natural flavours of the northern latitudes. It tells the story of a people who went from forest livelihoods to active interaction with neighbouring countries. The tale progresses to the newest international trends and the height of excellence. Finnish professionals have placed Finland on the gastronomic world map and made the capital, Helsinki, one of the globe’s most intriguing, trend-setting cities.<p><p>The golden chanterelle is the favourite mushroom of many Finns. Appearing earlier than many other mushrooms, the first chanterelles are picked at midsummer to accompany new potatoes, with the season continuing all the way into the autumn game and mushroom dishes.Photo: Promotion Programme for Finnish Food Culture (SRE)/Imagebank<p><p>The brilliant array of flavours stems from our four distinct seasons. Gently braised root vegetables and meat casseroles are a wonderful way to counteract the chill of winter. The spring sun – and steaming soups – melt even the most stubborn frost, with rhubarb and nettles the first delicacies to appear in the new growing season. Delicious “new potatoes,” harvested when small and tasty, are a staple of the dining table throughout early summer. Berries and mushrooms ripen for picking as summer progresses, while autumn is the time to store nature’s bounty for winter. Wild game and fresh fish provide seasonal variation throughout the year. It’s always a good season for Finnish food!<p><p>In Finland, nature produces food that is bursting with healthiness and genuine flavour. Bilberries from the wooded wilderness, cranberries from wild wetlands, rye from fields that have known winter frost − Finland is packed with superfoods!<p><p> <p><p>Innovation is also abundant outside the kitchen. Restaurant Savoy has begun rooftop gardening in the centre of Helsinki. The kitchen staff and customers love the fresh herbs and vegetables grown on the roof that is also home to a community of honeybees.Photo: Royal Restaurants<p><p>Finnish international-level chefs are taking their cuisine to the world and inviting the world’s foodies to our tables. Our innovators blend arctic ingredients; traditional preservation methods and cooking techniques; heritage dishes; and inspiration gained around the world to create experiences that will impress the most seasoned of gourmands.<p><p>There are opportunities for fantastic fine dining at numerous classy restaurants. The capital, Helsinki, is dotted with them, but there are unforgettable food experiences galore elsewhere in Finland as well.Photo: Royal Restaurants<p><p>In this approach to food, originality stems from small producers who boast premium-quality products with a unique touch: reindeer, a huge selection of wild mushrooms, indigenous Finnish cattle, intensely flavourful root vegetables, lush greens and tangy berries, to name a few. Artisan bakeries, cheese makers and breweries help restaurants create fantastic cuisine in which the authentic flavours of the ingredients shine through.<p><p>Finnish restaurants cultivate great respect for tradition. Would you like some Baltic herring breaded in rye flour and fried in butter to a glorious crispness? Or how about elk or venison with roasted root vegetables? Perhaps a slice of bilberry tart with vanilla sauce?<p><p>Restaurants are also constantly reinterpreting old favourites and developing new dishes. Fantastic whitefish (Finnish lavaret) may be seasoned with organic herbs grown on the restaurant’s roof terrace, while beetroot is no longer just pickled but presented in a myriad of exciting ways. Those who want something out of the ordinary should also look out for some of the sensational liquorice desserts our restaurants have on offer.<p><p> <p><p>Traditional Finnish flavours are given modern takes and making new friends at restaurants.Photo: SRE/Imagebank<p><p>Culinary culture is changing in Finland as it is all over the world, with food trends such as the organic and local food movements; food that enhances wellbeing; and exploration of new ingredients and ideas.<p><p>The entire food chain is moving towards more sustainable choices. Organic farming is widespread in Finland and the market is developing steadily. A rediscovered passion for local food has caught on rapidly. Finns are the third-biggest per capita consumers of Fairtrade products in the world. Carbon and water footprint labelling is being introduced in food packaging.<p><p>The art of making Karelian pasties is one of the old culinary skills that is still very much alive in Finland. Rice, or more traditionally barley, is baked inside very thin rye crust. It takes some practice to perfect the finger skills required for the folding technique.Photo: SRE/Imagebank<p><p>The flow of geographical changes also influences our food culture. The roots of traditional Finnish cuisine lie in Karelia in the east and on the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia in the west. Regional differences have become smaller but are still readily apparent. From our eastern heritage come oven-baked casseroles and the traditional delicacies laid out to celebrate Easter. Western traditions include soups and many of the dishes enjoyed during the biggest culinary feast of the year, Christmas. Reindeer from the northern Finnish region of Lapland forms a treat that is also appreciated in the southern areas of our country, and Karelian pasties have become a nationwide favourite as well as a link with history (part of Karelia was ceded to the Russians after the Winter War of 1939 and 1940).<p><p>One of the easiest ways to differentiate the regions is the local style of bread: unleavened flatbreads in the north, sweet-flavoured loaves in the west, sourdough rye bread and pasties in the east, and islander’s bread in the coastal areas of the south. The latter is a black, sweet loaf that keeps for ages.<p><p>The epitome of Finnish food culture − rye bread − is acquiring new forms.Photo: SRE/Imagebank<p><p>Changes in our lifestyle also affect our food culture. Everyday life is a lot less physically strenuous than it used to be, so instead of creamy milk many opt for lighter alternatives and watch their sugar intake. Microwave ovens, pre-prepared food and eating out in restaurants have become commonplace, and time previously devoted to cooking is freed up for other activities. At the same time, cooking has become a popular hobby and is inspiring a young generation of foodies to spend time in the kitchen.<p><p>International influences can be seen in the wide selection of Chinese, Italian and other ethnic restaurants, but Finnish creativity has also transformed many foreign styles into something new. Eclectic treats well worth tasting include barley risotto, reindeer carpaccio, Finnish shiitake mushrooms or sapas (Finnish tapas – the “s” comes from Suomi, the Finnish word for “Finland”).<p><p>Finland’s natural environment is very lush and rich is species during the summer. Collecting wild herbs is a component of ancient food knowledge that has become part of the rising food trend of recent years. Today many restaurants even use wild herbs that their chefs have picked themselves.Photo: SRE/Imagebank<p><p>For many Finns and foreigners, the most exciting Finnish food adventures have their origins in the wild. Unforgettable experiences can be conjured up from berries, mushrooms, freshwater fish and game.<p><p>Everyone can access nature’s local superfoods in Finland. The traditional Finnish legal concept of “everyman’s right” allows anyone to collect natural products as long as respect is shown for nature and landowners. Bilberries, lingonberries, chanterelles and boletus mushrooms are greatly savoured all year long. Many Finns pick wild berries and freeze them instead of buying them at grocery stores – a habit that is a source of wonder for many foreigners.<p><p>Our thousands of lakes offer tasty freshwater fish, and the Baltic Sea offers a source of ocean fish varieties. A fishing licence is easy to obtain, which means many people can enjoy newly caught fish. At holiday homes and summer cottages – another special feature of Finland accessible to most of the population – people prepare fish on the barbecue or in a smoker. Special seasons exist for various seafood delicacies: Early autumn means boistrous crayfish parties, and the winter is the time to enjoy burbot, as well as roe with blinis, Russian-style buckwheat pancakes. Ice-fishing – dropping a line through a hole in a frozen lake or ocean – forms a unique experience to try if you visit Finland in the winter.<p><p>Finland has thousands of lakes that offer a plentiful catch of fish. At the summer cabin fishing equipment is conveniently available, and preparing and eating the fish is a breeze after a successful fishing trip.Photo: Plugi<p><p>In Lapland the hiker does not need to carry water. There are clear mountain springs for a refreshing drink wherever you go.Photo: Visit Finland/Marja Pirilä<p><p>The artic wild bilberry is bursting with flavours and health-promoting nutrients. An outing to pick berries is also soothing for the soul.Photo: Rodeo/P. Jauhiainen <p><p>Many households enjoy meat from game hunted by family members. Mostly this means elk, but it can also be wild reindeer, hare, mallard or wood pigeon. In Finnish Lapland, reindeer herders own groups of animals that roam the fells.<p><p>Clean water forms a source of great pride for the Finns. Accessible groundwater can be found in almost every part of Finland. It’s utilised by homeowners and waterworks, and can usually be consumed without any treatment. Other sources of drinking water include lakes, of which Finland possesses more than 188,000. The liquid passes through purification treatment before use in homes and restaurants.<p><p>Finnish bilberries have many fans in Japan, boletus mushrooms are popular in Italy and birch sap is exported to France. Great demand exists for wild-harvested produce around the world.<p><p>Agriculture is in capable hands in our northern latitudes. The short growing season keeps farmers busy during seed time and harvest alike.Photo: SRE/Imagebank<p><p>No other country in the world possesses farmland that stretches this far north. Finland’s short summer and long winter pose challenges for those growing crops or raising livestock. In earlier days that meant a shortage of food in the winter. Nowadays it means creative solutions and quality food.<p><p>The growing season is short. The entire cultivation process has to be completed two months faster than in the warmer south. Autumn harvests need to take place swiftly, within just a few weeks – before winter sets in.<p><p>The light of the long summer days, the warmth of the Gulf Stream and the unique local plant varieties make fast growth possible. The amount of solar radiation received overall in Finland during the growing season is even greater than in continental Europe. Growth is also helped by the fact that in summer it is rarely too hot or dry, and there is always enough water available for irrigation. Winter frosts effectively destroy some of the pests and slow down the growth of many weeds.<p><p>Another aspect that makes the growing season special is the great difference between the day and night-time temperatures. Herbs become hugely aromatic and berries are packed with nutrients.<p><p>During winter fields rest beneath a cover of snow, but many cows enjoy their white pastures too.Photo: SRE/Imagebank<p><p>There is a bountiful supply of Finnish vegetables available in the autumn.Photo: Vastavalo/Tuula Roos<p><p>Finns are innovative developers of greenhouse practices. To create energy-efficient ways of growing vegetables, a lot of research has been put into reducing energy consumption. The resulting innovative methods mean that now greenhouse-grown cucumbers consume one-third less energy than a few decades ago.<p><p>There is no need for artificial pesticides in greenhouse cultivation, either. In the future eco-efficiency will play an even greater role. Urban cultivation will bring greenhouse production close to city consumers and may produce energy for local residents, as well as utilising surplus heat from nearby homes.<p><p>Organic and local produce have become staple choices among Finnish shoppers. Most is sold by ordinary supermarkets, but lots of new specialist shops have appeared in the past few years. Often found in city centres, these shops offer products made by countryside artisan producers to urban foodies.Photo: SRE/Imagebank<p><p>Finnish food is the safest in the world. This excellence is based on high-quality agricultural ingredients. Strict hygiene procedures set the standard for the entire food chain. Premises and equipment are meticulously cleaned, temperatures are kept at optimal levels and critical functions are subject to special monitoring. So you can enjoy eggnog made from fresh eggs, or allow your kids to scrape the mixing bowl to taste some cake batter.<p><p>Lactose intolerance is a fairly common condition in Finland. Since we are a nation of milk-drinkers, there is a wide selection of lactose-free dairy products available.Photo: Valio<p><p>Food allergies and intolerance are taken seriously. Those suffering from lactose intolerance will find plenty of reliably labelled low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products in ordinary shops. There are gluten-free bakery products for those suffering from coeliac disease. In many restaurants, compatibility with special dietary requirements is indicated on the menu, and if not, the waiter will be able to provide the information.<p><p>Functional foods represent the scientific zenith of health-promoting edibles. These scientifically researched products have special positive effects in addition to their conventional nutritional properties. The first Finnish functional food product to conquer the world was the tooth-friendly sweetener xylitol. It was followed by products that are good for the stomach, cholesterol levels and blood pressure.<p><p>Expertise in special diet products plays an important role in exports. Finnish lactose-free dairy products have gained a firm foothold in Sweden in recent years, and the conquest of America has begun. Italian sufferers of coeliac disease can enjoy pizza made in Finland. Finnish functional products are sold in dozens of countries around the world.<p><p>New research is progressing all the time. One particularly interesting field of study seeks to combine bio-, nano- and information technologies. Technology applications are already being utilised for purposes such as weight management.<p><p>Above all, safe and healthy food is founded upon day-to-day cooperation between researchers, government authorities and the food industry, and upon the wise choices that consumers make.<p><p>The heat of a living fire and the rustling of trees make a fish meal something very special.Photo: Rodeo/Juha Tuomi<p><p>The place to go for the best Finnish food is, of course, Finland. Whether enjoyed in the middle of the wilderness or at a classy restaurant, a Finnish meal always forms a wonderful experience for Finns and visitors alike.<p><p>On a nature trail or camping trip, sausages or newly caught perch taste perfect when grilled on an open fire and followed by a cup of freshly brewed coffee. If sitting on a tree stump in the middle of a dense forest feels slightly too exotic, there are plenty of well-equipped hiking areas with campfire sites set up for you. Or you can go for the easiest option and book a wilderness excursion with a guide.<p><p>At gourmet restaurants you will find fabulous Finnish flavours served on your plate.Photo: Royal Restaurants<p><p>Lapland, the Finnish far north, presents an excellent location for taking in the beauty of nature. Local reindeer herders will take you to the fells to sample charred salmon, reindeer sauté and other delicacies. The best way to quench you thirst is with a gulp of sparkling clean water straight from a mountain stream or woodland spring. If you head for the islands or inland waters, you get to experience fish prepared in a multitude of ways, while numerous farm holiday providers offer traditional dishes in a rural setting. Visit a manor house restaurant to sample classic dishes and buffet tables that the gentry used to enjoy. You need look no further than many urban restaurants for a rustic meal or home-style food. Helsinki is the easiest place to find the very top of gourmet excellence, but plenty of fine dining experiences are also available elsewhere in Finland.<p><p>Finnish food can be found here and there around the world. Cheeses, alcoholic beverages, butter, pork and chocolate form our main culinary exports. Check your local supermarket shelves and you may be able to spot Finnish thin crisp rye bread, genuine dairy milk chocolate, organic muesli with Finnish organic oats or gluten-free frozen baguettes.<p><p>Are you inspired to have a go at making a Finnish meal?

Anyone wanting professional advice on how to use Finnish correctly can call the hotline of the institute’s Language Planning Department, better known to Finns as Kielitoimisto (the Language Office).<p><p>Tai chi is a word recently imported to Finland from Asia.Photo: AP / Lehtikuva<p><p>Linguistic expert Riitta Eronen holds a position that does not exist in many countries, as part of a team of academics who advise people how they should use their own language. “It’s actually a myth that we decide whether a new word is correct Finnish as such, since we invariably find words through users who have already adopted them,” she says. “But we do recommend how new words can be adapted and used logically in Finnish so that everyone will understand them.”<p><p>Eronen believes that Finnish must adopt new words from other cultures to thrive in today’s globalised world: “We don’t follow any old-fashioned idea of trying to keep Finnish ‘pure’ by keeping out external influences. This would leave the language artificially isolated.”<p><p>She explains that surprisingly few words originating from the ancestral Fenno-Ugric language remain in modern Finnish. Throughout Finland’s chequered history, words have been absorbed from the languages of rulers or dominant cultures, including Nordic, Germanic, Baltic and Slavic languages, and today English – though a wave of recent Asian imports such including manga, tsunami and tai chi is also discernible. “It’s amazing how multicultural young Finnish speakers are today, especially in urban areas, speaking creatively by adopting and adapting words from different sources,” says Eronen.<p><p>Smoothies were meant to be called pehmelö, but the word failed to catch on.Photo: Dorota i Bogdan Bialy/Stockfood/Lehtikuva<p><p>Words borrowed from other languages are often altered to make them easier for Finnish speakers to pronounce. Harmonious vowels may be added to the end of loanwords – most often “i.” Consonants are often doubled, as in hattu, meaning hat. Finnish seldom uses the letters b, c, d, f and g; many loanwords use the nearest Finnish equivalents p; k or s; t; v; and k, respectively. Such processes take Finnish speakers from “bank” to pankki, in three easy stages.<p><p>By applying such logic backwards, you may be able to work out what the following initially unfathomable loanwords mean, even if you speak no Finnish (answers at the end of the article):<p><p>1. bussi 2. kahvi 3. kulta 4. lankku 5. matto 6. tohtori 7. pihvi 8. pallo 9. kuraattori 10. hevimusiikki<p><p>Familiar words may also be given inscrutable Finnish spellings and endings, such as liisaus (leasing), brändätä (to brand a product) and downshiftata. To confuse things further, Finnish speakers faced with tongue-twisting consonant clusters like “str-” may simply leave out the first letters. Ranta, meaning “beach,” is derived from a Swedish word that also exists in English: strand.<p><p>Sometimes morphed words like telefooni/telehvooni and kompuutteri fail to catch on, and Finns instead come up with their own words like puhelin (speaking-device) and tietokone (knowledge-machine). The Language Office is often asked to approve words that have been devised logically or creatively, or chosen through competitions. Recent examples include kännykkä (mobile phone), pehmelö (smoothie-drink) and sormitietokone (finger-computer).<p><p>Sauna is, without a doubt, the most famous Finnish word, and has made its way around the world. In our humble opinion, the best saunas are still found along the seashores and lakesides of Finland.Photo: Johanna Vuonokari/Lehtikuva<p><p>As new words and expressions become established, they are added by the Language Office to the New Dictionary of Modern Finnish. This “official” dictionary contains almost 100,000 entries and is updated regularly. “Ultimately, however, the language is not shaped by us here in the office, but by everyone out there who is creatively using it,” adds Eronen.<p><p>Linguistic integration is of course a two-way process. Several words originating in Finnish and Sámi are in use in English today, including – most famously – sauna, but also rapakivi (a granitic rock type), aapa (a kind of arctic bog), tundra and the ironic expression “Molotov cocktail” devised by Finnish soldiers for their Soviet enemies during the Winter War of 1939–40.<p><p>Answers to loanword quiz above: 1. bus 2. coffee 3. gold 4. plank 5. mat 6. doctor 7. beef (meaning “steak”) 8. ball 9. curator 10. heavy music<p><p> <p><p>By Fran Weaver and Carina Chela, August 2011<p><p>Global influences on modern Finnish<p><p>Twisted loanwords<p><p>Failed inventions and Finn-glish<p>", "time": "2011-08-29T06:14:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Setting the world aright at the “ladies’ sauna” - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/setting-the-world-aright-at-the-ladies-sauna/", "review": "", "content": "<p>For some prominent Finnish women, regular meetings of a sauna club are a source of strength.<p><p>On a beautiful but cool spring evening, three women sit together, sharing experiences and discussing current affairs. They are all movers and shakers of Finnish society: Sirkka Hämäläinen, former Governor of the Bank of Finland and member of the European Central Bank’s Executive Board, now a member of the boards of many corporations and organisations; Raija-Sinikka Rantala, with an impressive career as a theatre director, administrator and teacher as well as Helena Hiilivirta, director of the soon-to-be-completed Helsinki Music Centre. They are doing what they and their network, known as the “ladies’ sauna”, have done for more than 20 years.<p><p>The story began in 1987, when Sirkka Hämäläinen held various top-level posts at Finland’s central bank.<p><p>“I needed support and people I could talk to,” she recalls. “It seemed as if my whole life revolved around the economy and my own work; and I longed for perspectives from other areas of society.”<p><p>So she and a few friends set up a network which began to spend several evenings together each spring and autumn. The programme usually consisted of a presentation on a current event, socialising and sauna bathing together – as groups of Finnish male colleagues have always done.<p><p>“When we started these get-togethers, the Bank of Finland building’s sauna did not have any women’s bathing gear. Sirkka started to equip it properly,” recalls Raija-Sinikka Rantala.<p><p>The circle of women began to expand as others who had been invited to make presentations were invited to join the group.<p><p>“I joined in 1994. It was lovely to be able to relax in good company after a working day,” says Helena Hiilivirta.<p><p>In recent years, the “ladies’ sauna” has gathered about 20 women from the top echelons of finance, art, science, the church and other sectors of society. Only one man has ever served as a presenter. Another time, when the evening’s programme included practicing firing a handgun, a man was along to provide guidance, along with a woman director.<p><p>In the sauna.Photo: Sanna Liimatainen<p><p>The “ladies’ sauna” has also directed its resources into international arenas. In the 1990s, the group arranged public events abroad, first at Villa Lante, the Finnish cultural centre in Rome, then at the Finnish Institute in Athens and finally in Frankfurt during the first Finnish EU presidency term. These forums focused on Finland’s society, culture, art, security policy and economy.<p><p>“The audience didn’t find out that all the speakers were women until they arrived at the venue. You should have seen their faces!” Hämäläinen recalls with a smile.<p><p>Over the years, there have gradually been fewer sauna evenings, but the members keep in touch.<p><p>“There have been suspicions that we are some kind of secret society, as one after another member of our circle have risen to various administrative positions,” she says. “But in fact this has been a result of each one’s personal characteristics.”<p><p>By international standards, Finland boasts many women in leading positions in society. What factors lie behind women’s leadership and how have these women themselves risen to the top of their fields?<p><p>“I’d stress the significance of my own superiors,” says Hämäläinen. “Their support was a crucial factor in my rise to directorial positions.”<p><p>When she applied to become head of the Finance Ministry’s Economics Department and realised that the government would not back her unanimously for the post, she withdrew her application.<p><p>“My boss at the Bank of Finland at the time, Seppo Lindblom, said that if I didn’t have the nerve to compete for that job, then I should never complain that women in Finland don’t make it into leadership positions,” Hämäläinen recalls. She reapplied and was chosen for the job.<p><p>These women agree that those who take on more responsibility naturally gain more responsible jobs. As they see it, women have a tendency to take care of their responsibilities more precisely and punctually than men. Yet they are also more afraid than men to take risks and to fail.<p><p>“Nowadays women lead many theatres in Finland, because as organisations they are so much work to run. Men prefer to do more pleasant work,” claims Raija-Sinikka Rantala.<p><p>Of course these women, too, have encountered prejudice.<p><p>“I remember when I was applying for the job of intendent of the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. I was under 30, I had red hair and I was wearing some kind of colourful jumper,” says Hiilivirta with a laugh. “The interviewer asked me how I imagined I could make it in a managerial position when I hadn’t served in the army” – as most Finnish men have, due to mandatory conscription.<p><p>“Many men seem to think that women should always be sunny and pleasant. When I took over as Governor of the Bank of Finland during a crisis, a high-ranking officer asked me why I was always so serious on television and never smiled – I’d just been interviewed in a situation when I had to predict a sharp increase in unemployment,” says Hämäläinen. “I asked him if he would smile if he had to announce on television that Finland had been attacked!”<p><p>Unlike men, women leaders are always asked how they manage to balance a challenging job with family life. Each of these women has a family.<p><p>“It wasn’t easy when I had a small child at home,” says Rantala. “I remember how tight my time was when I used to rush home to fix dinner and then off to the theatre for evening rehearsals.”<p><p>“Support from one’s family is terribly important,” adds Hiilivirta. “My husband grew up with the idea of a mother having a strong role outside of the home. So my rise to leadership positions was not hard for him.”<p><p>In their own upbringing, each of these women received a strong message that a woman should have a career of her own and never be financially dependent on a man.<p><p>“Practical matters can always be arranged, but it’s more important to influence women’s own attitudes,” says Hämäläinen. “Women should be encouraged to take risks and responsibility. And when you’re in a leadership position, you have to accept the fact that you will make mistakes and that you will face criticism. And you need healthy self-confidence to withstand that.”<p><p>As she sees it, the best leadership training is not found in the military, but rather in a mother’s role.<p><p>“It’s much more difficult to manage your own child who is going through the ‘terrible twos’ than subordinates in the army, who are required to obey. A parent is always trying to help their children to blossom, to bring out the best in them – just as a good manager does,” she observes.<p><p>These women have watched with satisfaction as more and more women gain a chance to fulfil their potential in society’s leading positions. On the other hand, they are concerned about short-sighted operations driven by the latest quarterly reports, and the attendant rise of short-term contracts.<p><p>“After all, the individual and his or her welfare is the point of all economic activity,” notes Hämäläinen. “Over the long run, taking care of people is the best way to support economic health and competitiveness.”<p><p>By Salla Korpela, July 2009<p><p>Peer support and relaxation<p><p>Women taking over Europe<p><p>Women must be encouraged into leadership<p><p>Carrying responsibility – and power<p><p>Combining family and demanding work<p><p>Motherhood is the best leadership training<p>", "time": "2011-03-10T07:33:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Finland is no exception, and mythical creatures remained very much part of Finnish folklore until the country’s rapid urbanisation during the 20th century.<p><p>Many fabulous Finnish figures appear in the runic poems of the Kalevala – the national folk epic compiled in the 19th century by Elias Lönnrot. Finnish kids today are still familiar with the sanitised versions of such characters featured in modern children’s books and TV programmes. In the old days, many of these potentially dangerous creatures were very useful to parents of over-active children! More recently, author Johanna Sinisalo won the coveted Finlandia Prize in 2000 with a book about a troll, published in the US as Troll: A Love Story and in the UK as Not before Sundown.<p><p>And now let’s meet the mythical, often untranslatable creatures that have yet to be disproven. They are notoriously camera shy, and our photographers are also afraid to take the job (although they refuse to admit it), so we bring you illustrations instead. Maybe our guide will inspire you to go on a creature-spotting expedition – tread carefully.<p><p> <p><p>Appearance: Ranges in size from small to enormous. Hairy, with large nose and ears.<p><p>Habitat: Dark forests and rocky ridges<p><p>Behaviour: Slow, stupid and lazy. May turn into rocky landscape features for long periods, even centuries. Some individuals are aggressive and may kidnap children who stray too far from home. Children today fear the invisible Hammaspeikko, who secretively makes holes in their teeth. Another invisible subspecies, the Känkkäränkkä, still sometimes makes children fight, sulk or do other things that displease their parents.<p><p>Relatives in other mythologies: Scandinavian trolls, giants, goblins<p><p>Appearance: Seriously scary. This gargantuan creature from the deep resembles a giant, fierce octopus, with long tentacles and suckers. May also sprout dragon-like wings.<p><p>Habitat: Baltic Sea and large lakes<p><p>Behaviour: Solitary. Dangerously aggressive if disturbed.<p><p>Relatives in other mythologies: kraken, sea serpent, Loch Ness monster<p><p>Appearance: Beautiful creature like a small human, but with wings like those of a dragonfly or butterfly.<p><p>Habitat: Ponds deep in the forest, and misty meadows<p><p>Behaviour: Usually avoids people, but friendly if encountered accidentally. Loves to dance and socialise. Lives in a parallel ideal world of peace and harmony.<p><p>Relatives in other mythologies: fairies, sprites<p><p><p><p>Appearance: Small, human-like. Large head with pointed features. Often wears a pointed hat.<p><p>Habitat: Lives underground in remote forests, but may approach human settlements out of curiosity.<p><p>Behaviour: Nocturnal* and often timid. Usually friendly if approached carefully, but may trick children by leading them astray if they wander too far into the forest! Playful and likes to dance. Intelligent, and enjoys riddles. Likes to seek out shiny objects.<p><p>Relatives in other mythologies: gnomes, goblins, leprechauns, imps<p><p>* A well-loved Finnish romantic song from the 1940s, “Päivänsäde ja menninkäinen,” describes a chance meeting between a darkness-loving menninkäinen and a sunbeam.<p><p><p><p>Appearance: May appear friendly and alluring at first sight, but eventually reveals true appearance: horribly hairy and/or scaly<p><p>Habitat: Murky pools, especially under bridges, sometimes found in springs or wells.<p><p>Behaviour: May try to tempt children to come near the water, and then pull them in to drown them (a very useful spirit for nervous parents of accident-prone kids). Can also drown children who swim into deep water.<p><p>Relatives in other mythologies: water spirit, siren, vodyanoy (found in Russia)<p><p>Appearance: Big and bad<p><p>Habitat: Caves and gorges in wild, rocky landscapes<p><p>Behaviour: May attack unwary travellers in remote areas. Generally avoids human habitation, but may steal valuable objects from houses. Throws rocks around, creating boulder fields and cairns. Also carves out strange holes in rocky outcrops (hiidenkirnut) thought by humans to be used by a hiisi to churn milk.<p><p>Relatives in other mythologies: trolls, giants, goblins<p><p>Appearance: Small, child-like. Most easily seen around Christmastime, often wearing a red tunic and a pointed red hat topped with a sleigh bell. Keeps a close eye on children before Christmas, and will report any misbehaviour to Santa Claus, with sorry consequences for kids expecting presents.<p><p>Habitat: Closely associated with human habitation, often a specific building such as a farmhouse, stable or sauna. Children must always behave respectfully in the sauna to avoid upsetting the Saunatonttu.<p><p>Behaviour: Usually invisible or discrete. Generally good-natured. Trusted by humans as the guardian spirits of their homes and buildings. Must be respected and provided with food (fond of porridge and soup).<p><p>Relatives in other mythologies: elves, pixies, leprechauns<p><p> <p><p>Special thanks to Reeli Karimäki, University of Helsinki Dept. of Folklore Studies<p><p>By Fran Weaver<p><p>Peikko<p><p>Iku-Turso, or Tursas<p><p>Keiju<p><p>Menninkäinen<p><p>Näkki<p><p>Hiisi<p><p>Tonttu<p>", "time": "2015-04-09T07:28:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Great design and great dining in Fiskars - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/great-design-and-great-dining-in-fiskars/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The industrial village of Fiskars, now home to a flourishing community of artists and craftspeople, offers a delightful destination just over an hour away from Helsinki.<p><p>The nation’s oldest company, also named Fiskars, was established there in 1649 and later produced its iconic scissors with orange plastic handles. This often-copied ergonomic classic comes from the village where the Finnish metal industry was born.<p><p>The iconic Functional Form scissors may be Fiskars’ best-known design item.Photo courtesy of Fiskars Group<p><p>The journey from Helsinki to Fiskars is a voyage back to the roots of Finland’s high-tech industries and affluence. During the trip, which takes just over an hour, you pass the headquarters of the country’s biggest technology companies, bedroom communities and eventually come to an area of deciduous forest. Here, nestled in a lush valley, is one of the key sites of Finland’s cultural and industrial history. Fiskars was established as an ironworks in the mid-1600s.<p><p>For history buffs, a good place to begin is the Fiskars Museum, which provides a concise, lively overview of the area’s past. The small museum is located within a complex of 19th-century buildings by the upper rapids of the Fiskars River.<p><p>This free-flowing stream and abundant forest resources attracted early industrialists to set up one of Finland’s first blast furnaces here. In the early years, ore was shipped in from Sweden (which then ruled Finland) to the nearby port of Pohjankuru, and most of the finished iron products were sent back to Sweden via the same route.<p><p>Later the forge’s craftsmen developed ploughs and other farm equipment tailor-made for the stony Finnish soil. These in turn played a key role in advancing the country’s agricultural economy.<p><p>In the jewellery shops, you can see unique, contemporary silver jewellery and even meet the artisan at work.Photo: Ilkka Ärrälä/Fiskars<p><p>Those with an eye for art and handicrafts should head along the nearby branch of the Fiskars River towards its lower rapids. Over the past two decades, dozens of artists and craftspeople have settled in the village to live and work. Rows of former industrial buildings have been converted into galleries, workshops, studios, restaurants, shops and cafés.<p><p>Key places to stop along the way include the Clock Tower building and the old Copper Smithy. Here you can see local artists’ work along with invitational exhibitions featuring top international names. The main show in summer 2011, staged by the Fiskars Cooperative of Artisans, Designers and Artists, is titled Spatial Places – The Poetics of Place. It takes a cross-disciplinary approach to the relationship between space and person who experiences it. Another exhibition, simply entitled Tools, takes its theme from the area’s history, using various collections to spotlight the evolution of tools. Both are on display through September 25.<p><p>Those looking for unusual souvenirs or gifts will find a wealth of local offerings. The Onoma cooperative’s shop in the Clock Tower building and the Kopper design shop in the Copper Smithy sell textiles, ceramics, glass, wooden items and jewellery. In summer, these stores are open longer and have broader selections. Don’t miss the jewellery shops, where you can see unique, contemporary silver jewellery and even meet the artisans at work. If the weight of your purchases is not an issue, the craftspeople at the Forge sell useful and decorative wrought-iron items that evoke centuries of tradition. A selection of the Fiskars Corporation’s current product range is available at the Fiskars Shop.<p><p>Petri’s Chocolate Room offers handmade chocolate pralines and a mouth-watering array of cakes, which you can sample in the adjoining café. Upon request, Petri also arranges tastings of chocolates made from the world’s finest cocoa beans.<p><p>At the Kuparipaja restaurant, you can sit on a terrace overlooking the rapids and enjoy a drink.Photo: Olli Pekka Rönn/Fiskars<p><p>Those with more time and a bigger appetite can choose between two high-quality restaurants. Fiskars Wärdshus has been in business since 1836, making it one of Finland’s oldest operating restaurants. It bases its menu on seasonal raw materials and the Nordic cuisine heritage. The Raasepori Menu features culinary delights from small-scale local producers.<p><p>The Wärdshus, which accommodated horse-carriage drivers in olden times, still has 15 well-appointed hotel rooms. To soak in the traditional atmosphere of the ironworks village, be sure to ask for a room in the old part of the building.<p><p>Across the road at the Kuparipaja restaurant, you can sit on a terrace overlooking the rapids and enjoy a drink. While the building is traditional, the restaurant has a modern interior design. Its menu includes many alternatives for vegetarians and vegans.<p><p>There are also a couple of attractive bed-and-breakfast spots in the village. Most of the shops, restaurants and accommodations are also open in the winter, particularly during the Christmas season.<p><p>On the trip back to Helsinki, it’s worth making a slight detour to 18th-century Mustio Manor, one of Finland’s most elegant mansions. Its museum and park illustrate the site’s past, which involves many colourful figures from Finnish history. The manor has an upscale restaurant and hotel, which offer romantic hideaways. Mustio lies some 25 kilometres from Fiskars on the way to Helsinki.<p><p>Industrial buildings are converted into galleries, studios, shops and cafés. This granary now houses exhibition space.Photo: Pentti Hokkanen/Fiskars <p><p>Hop a coastal train to Karjaa from either Helsinki or Turku. Trains run about once an hour and the trip takes just under an hour from either city. The simplest way to make the 15-kilometre trip from Karjaa to Fiskars is by taxi, which costs about 25 euros. On summer weekends there are also several buses daily.<p><p>If you want to get a feel for the Finnish roads and landscapes, hire a car and set the navigator for Raasepori municipality, address: Peltorivi 1. This will lead you to Fiskars’ Market Square. The distance from the capital is about 90 kilometres, half of it on motorways. By bicycle, the 100-kilometre route from Helsinki to Fiskars follows the old King’s Road, which connected the eastern and western parts of the ancient Kingdom of Sweden. In Fiskars, the main sights are all concentrated within easy walking distance of each other.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, July 2011<p><p>Jewellery straight from the smithy<p><p>Local culinary craft<p><p>How to reach Fiskars<p>", "time": "2011-07-19T08:43:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Nature in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/nature-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Published July 2011<p><p>Finland is by nature such a complex and diverse country that it is not easy to describe in a single word – except perhaps “contrast”.<p><p>The most obvious contrast is between the annual seasons. The same lake where people come to swim and sail in summer forms a perfect skating rink or skiing arena in the winter. Warm, light summer nights gradually lengthen, until the snow settles and the late dawn merges colourfully into the early sunset during the midwinter season known to Finns as kaamos.<p><p>The country’s population is concentrated in the south, especially around the Helsinki region, which is home to about a million people. At the other end of the country lie the vast unpopulated forests and fells of arctic Lapland.<p><p>But the scenery also changes on a smaller scale. Water is never far away. Dense forests always await somehwhere nearby. And there is also sure to be open bog or farmland within easy reach. All of these landscapes are part of Finland’s varied natural scene.<p><p>In midwinter most of Finland is usually covered by snow and ice. In February, the coldest month, average temperatures are around -7ºC in the south and -13ºC in the north. Photo: Finnish Tourist Board (FTB)<p><p>In Southern and Central Finland the summers are warm enough for people to bathe in lakes and also often along the shores of the Baltic Sea.Photo: Plugi/Petri Jauhiainen<p><p>Finland is so far north that it lies on the same latitudes as Alaska or Central Siberia. About a quarter of the country is north of the Arctic Circle.<p><p>Considering this location, you might think that the country consists of cold arctic landscapes roamed by polar bears. But the truth is fortunately quite different. The ocean current known as the North Atlantic Drift brings so much warmth to Finland that average temperatures in the south are around +5°C, and even up north they are only a couple of degrees below zero.<p><p>The winters are nevertheless so cold that every single lake freezes over during the coldest months. The coastal waters of the Baltic Sea also typically freeze over, and snow covers the ground for several months.<p><p>But on summer days, temperatures can rise up to 25 or even 30°C. The growing season for plants is still comparatively short, however, averaging just 3–4 months.<p><p>Over the ages, nature has adapted to Finland’s pronounced seasonal swings. Most of the country’s plants and animals lie dormant through the winter months, and three-quarters of bird species are migratory.<p><p>On the world map Finland also lies between east and west, and the climate combines continental influences from the east, and maritime influences from the Atlantic to the west.<p><p>This factor is also evident in Finland’s flora and fauna. Finland is home to species associated with the taiga of continental Eurasia, such as Ural owls and Labrador tea, as well as maritime species including many waders and water birds.<p><p>Key elements in Finland’s varied landscapes include forests and open waters, often in a scenic interplay.Photo: Plugi/Janne Eloranta<p><p>During the last ice age Finland was completely covered by a thick continental ice sheet. This slowly moving mass of ice wore down the rocks and cliffs, and carved out lake basins. Meltwater rivers inside the ice deposited long ridges of sand and gravel which now stand above the surrounding landscape as eskers – the longest of which extend for tens of kilometres.<p><p>Eskers are not very high, seldom rising more than a hundred metres. Finland’s landscapes generally do not feature massive elements such as high mountains, steep sea cliffs or wide rivers. The scenery tends to be gentler, featuring subtle variety on a smaller scale.<p><p>The relief becomes higher heading eastwards and northwards. The greatest differences in altitude are in Lapland, where many fell-tops rise above the tree line.<p><p>Soils are generally thin, with an average depth to the bedrock of just seven metres, because of glacial erosion. The archaic mainly granitic bedrock is visible in many places as rounded and smoothed down rocky outcrops.<p><p>Because of the poor soils and the short growing season conditions for farming are not very favourable. By European standards the country is sparsely settled, with an average population density just a tenth of levels in Germany, Britain or Italy.<p><p>Successive ice ages and the cold climate have led to the formation of a wide range of peatland and wetland habitats around Finland.Photo: Plugi/Tuomas Heinonen<p><p>Finland is Europe’s most forested country. About 70% of the land is covered with trees. Most forests are coniferous, as the country lies at the western edge of the coniferous taiga forest zone that stretched off eastwards through Russia and Siberia.<p><p>Forests are still natural in the sense that hardly any non-native trees have been planted. The dominant trees are Scots pine, Norway spruce and birches, though forests are also dotted with aspens, alders and rowans.<p><p>Impressive anthills are a common sight in Finland’s vast coniferous forests.Photo: Plugi/Toni Pihkanen<p><p>Cloudberries grow widely in the bogs of Central and Northern Finland.Photo: FTB/Pekka Luukkola<p><p>Four kinds of grouse can be found in Finland’s forests and bogs: capercaillie (pictured), black grouse, hazel grouse and willow grouse. A fifth grouse – the ptarmigan – lives on Lapland’s open fells.Photo: FTB<p><p>Even though they feature few tree species, forest habitats can very greatly. Over a small area spruce thickets may alternate with sunlit pinewoods, marshy hollows and open bedrock.<p><p>Many forests are so damp and their soils are so peaty that they can be described as mires. Different kinds of mires cover about a third of Finland. About a sixth of this area consists of treeless bogs. About half of Finland’s mires have at some time been drained to improve timber production.<p><p>Forests and bogs are mainly owned by local farming families, who manage their forests and harvest timber according to fairly strict rules governing forestry practices. Finland does not have monotonous regimented forest plantations of a single tree species. Many foreign visitors mistakenly assume that Finland’s forests are completely natural, but the reality is that they have been continuously exploited in many ways for centuries.<p><p>About 8% of the country’s forests are protected. Most of the larger protected areas are in the north.<p><p>All regions of Finland have lakes, but the true Lake District is in the east, where in many areas water covers more than a third of the land.Photo: Visit Finland/Terhi Ylimäinen<p><p>Finland is reputed to be the Land of a Thousand Lakes, but in fact the country has tens of thousands of lakes. Most of these lakes are small and shallow. Lakes have an average depth of about seven metres.<p><p>Even in the largest lakes, like Saimaa in the southeast, open waters are broken up by many islands and peninsulas. It’s not always easy to say where one lake ends and another begins.<p><p>The same is true of Finland’s intricate coastline, which features around 95,000 sea islands, most of which are small rocky skerries. Sailors say that the waters of the labyrinthine Southwestern Archipelago are some of the most navigationally challenging anywhere in the world.<p><p>The total length of the coastline has been measured at 40,000 kilometres, including the shores of islands. The lakeshores are even longer – totalling about 130,000 kilometres. This means that the country has approximately 32 metres of shoreline for every inhabitant. People are used to having open water always somewhere nearby.<p><p>This abundance of water is also good for birds. In the summertime huge numbers of wetland and water birds breed in Finland, including many duck and wader species, and huge cranes.<p><p>And of course wherever there’s water, there are also fish. Finland has 61 native fish species, mostly freshwater fish. One unusual feature is that many lake fish can also thrive in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, where salinity levels are low.<p><p>Lapland’s arctic fells have gently rolling profiles.Photo: Hannu Vallas<p><p>Even by Finnish standards, the country’s northernmost province, Lapland, is sparsely settled. Lapland accounts for about 28% of Finland’s total area, but only 4% of the population.<p><p>Lapland’s natural features include vast areas of wild forest, open fells, flora and fauna adapted to the harsh arctic conditions, and greater variations in relief than anywhere else in the country. Seasonal variations are also even more pronounced here. The deep snows and darkness of midwinter contrast dramatically with the light, mild summers of the Land of the Midnight Sun.<p><p>Inquisitive Siberian jays invariably appear whenever hikers stop for a picnic in Lapland.Photo: Plugi/Peter Forsgård<p><p>Semi-domesticated reindeer roam freely through the forests and fells, foraging for lichens and other food.Photo: FTB<p><p>In mid September Lapland’s vegetation turns spectacular colours during a popular hiking season known to Finns as ruska.Photo: Plugi/Pentti Sormunen<p><p>Lapland has both forest-covered hills and open fells. Even the highest hilltops are only about 1,300 metres above sea level, but this far north the tree line is so low that many fell-tops are treeless.<p><p>Heading down the hillside, the first trees to be encountered are low mountain birches, interspersed with a few pines. Only below this sparsely wooded zone can true forests be found, dominated by pines or spruces. Open bogs can be found among the forests, including some very large bogs in low-lying areas.<p><p>Almost 30% of Lapland’s natural habitats are protected, including Finland’s largest national parks – three of which extend over more than 1,000 square kilometres. The traditional local livelihood of reindeer herding can be practised in almost all of Lapland’s protected areas.<p><p>Other traditional practices including hunting and fishing are still important in Lapland, alongside the more recently developed tourism industry.<p><p>Towns and cities are mainly small and low-rise, with no skyscrapers. In the winter the locals love to get out onto the frozen sea, as they are doing here outside Helsinki.Photo: City of Helsinki Media Bank/Matti Tirri<p><p>Finland is one of the most rural countries in the EU, since more than a quarter of the population (1.5 million people) live in rural areas. Most of these rural residents are not farmers, however, as many people live in the country but work in towns. Finland today has almost 63,000 working farms, with an average cultivated area of 35 hectares. The share of organic farming is double the EU average.<p><p>Almost every farm includes some areas of forest, as well as fields. The countryside is characterised by a patchwork landscape of forests and fields, also dotted with lakes.<p><p>Since soils and other physical conditions tend to be unfavourable, fields have only been created in the best possible locations, and they consequently tend to be small. The largest areas of open farmland can be found in SW Finland.<p><p> <p><p>Traditional Finnish landrace livestock breeds are still raised, though most productive herds today consist of imported commercial breeds. The Finnish horse is a docile breed, good for riding or pulling carts.Photo: Arto Repo<p><p>Finnish arable and livestock farms tend to be small-scale family operations. It has been said that Finland is a country where every cow still has a name.<p><p>Nature has also successfully established a foothold in towns and cities, which by European standards are mainly small, and offer easy access to natural green areas. Few cities have larger landscaped parks, but almost all urban residential areas lie within a short walk of natural forests criss-crossed by footpaths, cycle paths and skiing trails.<p><p>Many towns also have waterside locations enabling residents to go swimming in the summertime within a stone’s throw of the town centre.<p><p>Holiday homes are almost always located by a lake or the sea or on an island. Even people who don’t have their own second home can rent such cottages for a week or longer.Photo: Plugi/Helena Pitkänen<p><p>Finns see themselves as people who still live very close to nature. There’s a lot of truth in this, since even those living in urban areas like to spend time in natural settings: walking, skiing, or just spending time at their out-of-town holiday homes.<p><p>Heading off to the holiday home is a deeply rooted tradition among Finns. There are almost half a million second homes for a national population of just over five million. These retreats vary greatly in size and facilities. Older holiday homes tend to be small and modest, but more recently built cottages are true second homes, fitted with all modern conveniences. About half of the country’s holiday homes are habitable in winter.<p><p> <p><p>In a good year up to 50 million kilos of wild berries are picked in forests – about 10 kg per person. The most commonly picked berries are bilberries, lingonberries and cloudberries. Mushrooms are also picked widely.Photo: FTB<p><p>Finland’s traditional right to roam the land allows everyone to camp out temporarily in the great outdoors. To camp for longer periods or light a fire, the landowner’s permission is needed.Photo: FTB/Pekka Luukkola<p><p>Finland’s liberal rights of common access to the land enable everyone, including foreign visitors, to roam freely through forests and other natural areas on foot or on skis and even pick wild berries and mushrooms, regardless of who owns the land. Hunting rights and the right to fish with nets or lures are tied to the ownership of the land or fishing waters, however.<p><p>Finland’s 37 national parks, with their extensive networks of trails, are vey popular among hikers. Most of these parks are fairly small, less than 100 km2, and their primary purpose is to protect nature and biodiversity.<p><p>In addition to these national parks, Finland also has many other kinds of protected areas, including the wilderness areas of Lapland and mire protection areas. The first nature reserve was established in 1916 up in the high hills in the northwestern corner of Finnish Lapland.<p><p>Finland’s national bird, the whooper swan, owes its survival to nature conservationists. Its numbers have increased from just 15 pairs in the 1950s to more than 5,000 pairs today. These graceful swans are now a common sight on Finland’s lakes again.Photo: Plugi/Pentti Sormunen<p><p>Animals only returned to Finland fairly recently after the continental ice sheet receded from Fennoscandia at the end of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago – though they were helped by a subsequent warm climatic period lasting four millennia.<p><p>Relieved of the massive ice sheet, the land began to rise gradually, alternately opening up and closing natural waterway connections. When the vast Saimaa Lake System, in SE Finland, was cut off from the Baltic Sea, salmon and ringed seals were also marooned, and they have survived in the lake to this day.<p><p>Other Finnish wildlife specialities include arctic animals and species associated with coniferous taiga forests. The fells of the far north are still home to the critically endangered arctic fox, which may vanish altogether from Finland if the climate warms. Another rare and exotic inhabitant of Finnish Lapland is the pure white snowy owl.<p><p>Finland is particularly well endowed with owls. Ten species can be found here, also including great grey owls and hawk owls.<p><p>Another exotic animal, the flying squirrel, makes its home across most of mainland Southern Finland wherever there is enough undisturbed mixed forest.<p><p>One of the country’s most impressive four-legged residents is the elk. Elk can be seen anywhere in Finland, where they thrive so well that due to the scarcity of their natural predators they must be hunted to control their numbers.<p><p>Bears roam throughout Finland, but are commonest in the country’s eastern borderlands, where several local firms run bear-watching excursions.Photo: Plugi/Jorma Leskelä<p><p>Large carnivores are generally faring well in Finland, where there are plenty of undisturbed wild areas and abundant prey. Finland is home to all four of Europe’s large predatory mammals: brown bears, wolves, lynx and wolverines.<p><p>Finland’s predators have not always had it so good, however. They used to be widely persecuted here, as in other countries, especially in the 1800s and early 1900s. Persecution has since declined, but conflicts still arise at times, especially in Lapland, where wild predators often kill reindeer. Wolverines particularly have a bad reputation in this respect.<p><p>Golden eagles and other birds of prey are no longer persecuted in Finland. This change in attitude is partly because reindeer herders are today paid compensation scaled according to the numbers of eagles successfully breeding in each herding district.Photo: Plugi/Lassi Kujala<p><p>The wolverine is Europe’s rarest large carnivore. Wolverines are well adapted to northern climes, and able to move around easily even in deep snow.Photo: Plugi/Timo Saloranta<p><p>More lynx live in Finland today than at any time in the last hundred years. They have even been seen in Helsinki’s suburban fringe.Photo: FTB<p><p>In recent decades the populations of large carnivores have been purposefully restored, and their numbers are now stable. Finland is home to more than 1,600 bears, about 150-160 wolves, nearly 2,500 lynx and 150–170 wolverines.<p><p>But anyone out walking in the forests is very unlikely to see any of these animals. All four species are wary of people, and seek to avoid us whenever possible. The best way to see them is to join a guided wildlife watching excursion. This typically involves spending the night in a simple hide out in the forest.<p><p>Many birds of prey have also become more common in recent times. Numbers of white-tailed eagles, for instance, have soared since the 1970s to about 1,000. These majestic birds today occupy some 300 breeding territories around Finland.<p><p>By Eeva-Liisa Hallanaro, M.Sc., Environmental Expert<p><p>A world of wild contrasts<p><p>A northern land<p><p>Varied landscapes<p><p>Forests and bogs<p><p>Water, water everywhere<p><p>The arctic wilds of Lapland<p><p>Town and country<p><p>Living close to nature<p><p>Northern wildlife<p><p>Where predators prowl<p>", "time": "2011-12-14T13:19:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

But we won’t rest on our laurels. We’re out to become the most active nation of all!<p><p>There are many reasons to exercise. You may have a competitive spirit or want to test your limits. You may be aiming to keep fit and look good, or you might simply want to relax and have fun with a group of like-minded people. Most Finns are active because it promotes health and wellbeing.<p><p>Children learn to ski at an early age.Photo: Antero Aaltonen <p><p>Sports are the number one hobby among children: More than 90 percent of those under 18 are physically active. Sports activities take place in clubs or in informal groups of friends. Favourites include football (soccer), ice hockey, floorball and various forms of gymnastics.<p><p>Of the adult population, 90 percent exercise at least twice a week and more than 50 percent at least four times a week. Adults favour sports that are easy to fit into their busy schedules, such as running, going to the gym and exercise classes that are conveniently scheduled at various times of day.<p><p>Soccer is the number one sport among children.Photo: Roni Rekomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>their members in one or more sports. Clubs are run mainly by volunteers; most are non-profit organisations, with participation based on club membership.<p><p>Most sports clubs are members of a national association or a regional organisation. All national sports associations are members of the Finnish Sports Federation (FSF), including the 74 different sports federations, the Young Finland Association, the Finnish Olympic Committee and sports organisations for people who are disabled. FSF has a total of 130 member organisations.<p><p>The Finnish National Lottery is the largest individual financer of physical activities and sports. Some 25 percent of its profits are directed to sports through direct grants to clubs or via the Ministry of Education and Culture, which supports national sports organisations and municipalities. Municipalities maintain local sports facilities and provide financial support for local clubs. Other funding for sports clubs comes directly from the athletes or members, from sponsors and, to some extent, from the private sector.<p><p>In addition to clubs, independent fitness activity, company facilities and gym chains are becoming increasingly popular.<p><p>Numerous Finns keep fit by Nordic walking. The sport is also growing in popularity in other countries. Finland’s versatile natural environment provides good opportunities for open-air activities.Photo: Antero Aaltonen<p><p>Volunteer work forms the cornerstone of physical activity and sports in Finland. Out of a population of 5.4 million, as many as 600,000 people volunteer their free time to sports clubs – that amounts to more than 10 percent of the population. The ballpark estimate of the annual value of this volunteer work is 1.5 billion euros.<p><p>Sports clubs are run by volunteers, who also coach club members. In addition to helping out at clubs, Finns are also keen to volunteer their time to help organise sporting events.<p><p>One of the largest such events is the Jukola Relay, held annually since 1949. One of the biggest orienteering competitions in the world, it’s also the largest annual sporting event in Finland. Every year some 15,000 competitors from all corners of the world participate, watched by 30,000 spectators. It takes around 2,000 volunteers to put on the event.<p><p>The best way to enjoy the winter landscape is on cross-country skis. There are free, well-maintained ski trails throughout the country.Photo: Antero Aaltonen<p><p>The great versatility of Finland’s natural environment, together with the country’s four distinctive seasons and ‘everyman’s right’ – the legal right of Finns to roam the wilderness regardless of who owns the land – provide ample opportunities for open-air activities. Outdoor sports are popular in Finland, including trekking, hiking, walking, Nordic walking, cross-country skiing, Nordic skating, cycling and canoeing.<p><p>City planning is paying increasing attention to pedestrian and cycling routes; exercise and recreation areas; and other local sports facilities. Most Finnish municipalities and towns have a swimming pool, a football pitch, an ice rink and an indoor facility for badminton, volleyball, basketball and floorball.<p><p>There are 13 sports institutes in Finland, each specialising in certain sports. They offer excellent facilities for competitive and professional athletes as well as hobbyists. In addition, the institutes are important educators in sports-related professions at both secondary and university levels, and boast leading expertise in areas such as testing and sports technology.<p><p>Research in sports science takes place at the University of Jyväskylä and the Research Institute for Olympic Sports (KIHU). Other institutes performing sports research include the Foundation for Sport and Health Sciences (LIKES), the UKK Institute and sports medicine centres around the country. Finnish sports and exercise scientists are renowned worldwide.<p><p>Spectators cheer at the World Athletics Championships at Helsinki’s Olympic Stadium in August 2005.Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>Finland is a sports nation, and Finns love to rally around their teams and root for their athletes. Over 70 percent of Finns either attend sporting events or watch sports via the media. Popular spectator sports include cross-country skiing, ski jumping, athletics, ice hockey, football and motor sports such as Formula One and World Championship Rally. More recent favourites include floorball, as well as snowboarding and other alpine sports.<p><p>Many Finns are happy to exercise for leisure, but different sporting events also tempt an increasing number of amateurs to the starting line. During the summer and autumn months, marathons and other running and walking events take place practically every week in various parts of the country. The annual Naisten kymppi, a 10-kilometre fun run for women, has been held 27 times, evolving into a massive event with 20,000 participants.<p><p>Winter and spring months are filled with skiing events; the best-known one is the traditional Finlandia Ski Marathon.<p><p>Several international competitions take place in Finland every year, including some 20 world cup championships and other international events. Finland organises more events than many larger European countries.<p><p>As organisers, Finns are known as reliable hosts whose competitions and international congresses run smoothly. The events are also environmentally conscious and utilise the latest technologies. The Helsinki IAAF World Athletics Championships in 2005 formed a memorable event, not least because it was efficient and ecological. The ECOmass environmental programme was launched specifically for the purpose of decreasing the environmental load of the event and establishing an environmentally friendly operation model for future events. Athletes and spectators alike applauded the welcoming atmosphere, too.<p><p>A new programme called “Ready Steady Go! Finland” aims to get people moving all around the globe, not just in Finland.<p><p>By encouraging the international growth of Finnish companies in the field of innovative sports design, accessories and services, Ready Steady Go! Finland wants to make sure that the country’s valuable contribution does not go unnoticed.<p><p>Why sport, why Finland? Why not? This is the position of Ornamo and Finpro, who stand behind the project. Ornamo is the Finnish Association of Designers and Finpro forms a network for Finnish companies looking to breakthrough internationally. Aalto University is also cooperating with them. Judging from Finland’s wide-ranging success in sports and proven expertise in technology, design and nature, Ready Steady Go! Finland represents a safe bet for the parties involved.<p><p>Links:<p><p>Finpro Ornamo<p><p>Driver Mikko Hirvonen traverses the legendary Ouninpohja special stage during Rally Finland in Jyväskylä.Photo: Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva <p><p>In which sports do Finns excel?

But there’s a growing range of summer activities on offer that take advantage of the area’s natural beauty and endless light.<p><p>I’m a city person. During the past decade, I’ve lived in London, Vancouver, Toronto, and Helsinki. I’ve never lived in the countryside; even the suburbs make me feel a bit anxious, like I’m too far away from the centre of things.<p><p>However, that all changed when I visited Lapland for the first time three years ago, shortly after I moved to Finland. From the moment I stepped out of the airplane at Ivalo Airport, the country’s most northern airport, I was overwhelmed by the fresh air and the natural beauty visible from the tarmac, as we walked toward the small terminal building.<p><p><p><p>It was weeks from the summer solstice and already the night spilled into day, without the sun ever setting, which meant that I was able to pack a lot into my trip, from panning for gold in Tankavaara to whitewater rafting near the holiday resort of Saariselkä, and dipping into the cool, clean waters of Lake Inari, Europe’s sixth largest lake, which draws fishers from around the globe for its world famous salmon.<p><p>Since then, I’ve visited different areas of Finnish Lapland and tried various activities. I’ve learned to appreciate the quiet beauty of the wilderness, but I haven’t gotten over my surprise at spotting reindeer (they really are everywhere), and have even considered moving to Lapland. The laidback friendliness of the locals is a charming bonus.<p><p>Here’s my shortlist (by no means definitive) of where to go and what to do and see in Finnish Lapland:<p><p><p><p>I caught my first fish, a greyling, near Kuusamo, which is right on the border of the Arctic Circle. I’d never been fly-fishing on a river before and once I tried it, I was hooked. The Kitkajoki, Kuusinkijoki and Oulankajoki rivers in Kuusamo are renowned for the great trout that come from Lakes Paanajärvi and Pääjärvi in Russia.<p><p>The clean waters of Finland teem with a wide variety of fish. River fishing is allowed between June 1st and September 10th. Various lures and flies are permitted, but live bait cannot be used in rivers that have whitefish or salmonoids. Ice fishing and angling with a hook and line are allowed on lakes (with 180,000 of them in Finland, there are plenty of options) and ponds throughout the year by something called jokamiehenoikeus, or “everyman’s right,” which means that no permits are needed. General permits for lure fishing and special waters are needed.<p><p><p><p>“Everyman’s right” means foreigners and Finns have free access to forests, whether publicly or privately owned. Most routes are found in National Parks and close to holiday resorts, with varying terrain. Because there are few steep mountains in Finland, few hikes require rock-climbing abilities or equipment.<p><p>Hiking the Bear’s Trail (Karhunkierros) in Oulanka National Park.© Pohjolan Mylly<p><p>Among the best-known hiking trails are Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park; the 800-kilometre-long Kalottireitti (also known as Nordkalottleden Trail), which runs through the arctic fells of Finland, Sweden and Norway; Pyhätunturi; the Luosto area; Posio Korouma and the Urho Kekkonen (UKK) route in Salla. (The UKK trail is named after Urho Kaleva Kekkonen, who was one of the longest reigning Finnish presidents holding the country’s top post from 1956 to 1981.)<p><p>For a gentle introduction, try Karhunkierros (the Bear’s Trail) in Oulanka National Park, which was formed thousands of years ago when waters from the melting ice shaped the ravines, canyons and river beds. The longest trail (80 kilometres) starts at Hautajärvi Nature Centre and requires three to seven days. The shorter one, Pieni Karhunkierros (Small Bear’s Trail) can be easily done in an afternoon as it is 12 kilometres long.<p><p>The hiking is relatively easy and the scenery picturesque (reminiscent of an Akseli Gallen-Kallela painting), as the trails wind through forests and canyons.<p><p>As in all Finnish National Parks, there are log huts one can stay overnight in along the path; these are maintained by Metsähallitus, the state enterprise which is responsible for more than 12-million hectares of state land.<p><p>Midnight Sun Film Festival In June, Sodankylä<p><p>A number of festivals take place in Lapland during the summer. Possibly the most famous is the Midnight Sun Film Festival, which is held in Sodankylä every year. Here, the world’s cinema-rati come together for nonstop screenings at the top of the world. This year legendary French actor Michel Piccoli will attend the festival, as will Italian director and producer Gian Vittorio Baldi and Russian director Andrei Smirnov. There are always surprise guests – a few years ago it was director Francis Ford Coppola and the festival, which was founded by Finnish filmmaking brothers Aki and Mika Kaurismäki, is lauded for its lack of VIP ceremonies or services. Every film fan is welcome.<p><p>Jutajaiset International Folklore Festival In June, Rovaniemi<p><p>In Rovaniemi, home of Santa Claus, the Jutajaiset International Folklore Festival brings together midsummer ceremonies and music and dance from Argentina to Africa. In addition to international guests such as the Uinjilisti Choir from Tanzania, local Sámi rock bands including Naiv, Hra Apatia, Slain, Kasapanos and Stalingrad Cowgirls are on the bill.<p><p>Pyhä Unplugged In August, Pyhä<p><p>Pyhä Unplugged is an acoustic music festival that has been called “the most sympathetic festival in Finland.” The performing artists are usually well-known Finnish rockers, who perform partly for the challenge of playing without amplifiers or special effects. Concerts are organised at the Hotel Pyhätunturi, Tajukangas (blues by the bonfire) and Aittakuru (an amphitheatre designed and constructed by nature.) Mato Valtonen, actor, inventor and musician, who is perhaps best known for his role in the Leningrad Cowboys, that lovely spoof band immortalised in Aki Kaurismäki’s films, is the artistic director.<p><p><p><p>One of many adventures: mountain biking.© Pohjolan Mylly<p><p>A growing number of companies provide summer safaris and excursions ranging from white water rafting to expeditions into the history and culture of the Sámi, the indigenous people of Scandinavia. A Santa Claus safari offered by a tour operator in Rovaniemi takes participants to the Santa Claus Village where they can meet the man himself and visit his workshop. Also in Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland, Artikum, a science centre and museum that specialises in Lapland and the arctic regions, showcases the people, nature, history, customs and cultures north of the Arctic Circle. (Please note that the permanent exhibition of the Arctic Centre is closed until March 31st, 2007). Wild North (Villi Pohjola) is a versatile nature adventure tour operator that offers trips back in time – see what life was like in a logging camp – and a variety of programs such as Exotic Summer Wellness à la Wild North, which combines refreshing exercise and local culture in the peace and quiet of the Arctic. Wild North also operates about 200 holiday cottages available in different price ranges in peaceful, unspoilt locations.<p><p>The province of Lapland, “Lappi” in Finnish, is part of a larger geographical area in the far north of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. In Finland, Lapland technically starts at the Arctic Circle, though cities such as Kuusamo, which are near the Circle are considered by many to be part of Finnish Lapland.

New trails, picnic sites and other facilities for visitors will soon be created following the area’s designation as a new national park. This will provide a valuable new recreational amenity in the east to rival the popular Nuuksio National Park, which lies just west of the capital.<p><p>The Sipoonkorpi National Park is easy to reach from Helsinki. Photo: Metsähallitus <p><p>But the main reason for establishing the park is to protect Sipoonkorpi’s old-growth forests, rocky crags and woodland springs and streams, together with their rare flora and fauna, in the face of increasing pressure for building development as the Helsinki conurbation spreads eastward.<p><p>Its total extent of just 18.5 square kilometres makes Sipoonkorpi one of Finland’s smallest national parks, but Minister of the Environment Paula Lehtomäki, in office at the time of the park’s inauguration, said she hoped more land would soon be acquired for the park. “Landowners in surrounding areas will be encouraged to join conservation schemes, and we are also urging local authority planners to establish ecological corridors linked to the park to benefit nature, as well as recreational areas to benefit the many people who live nearby,” she said.<p><p>A view of the Bothnian Sea National Park.

Nature conservationists are disappointed that the park includes few islands and shores, and that the hunting of seals and seabirds has not been more restricted within its boundaries.<p><p>Lehtomäki admits conservation compromises had to be accepted to make the designation of the park acceptable to local communities, and particularly to help the local fishing industry. But she feels the park still fulfils its main goal of protecting ecosystems beneath the waves. “The establishment of this large marine national park in the west fills the last major gap in our protected areas network,” she says.<p><p>On boat trips out to the Bothnian Sea’s lonely lighthouse islands from Uusikaupunki or Rauma, visitors can spot the new park’s wildlife, including inquisitive seals, sea ducks, auks and white-tailed eagles.<p><p>National parks for all seasons<p><p>Finland’s 37 national parks cover a total area of almost 1,000 square kilometres.

Over all those years, it has been mission impossible to pin it down on the political map. However, it is easier to overrate than to downplay the party’s essence.<p><p><p><p>The safest bet, at least at first, is to call the “True Finns” populist. They can also be categorised as EU-critical and as a party that stands for tighter immigration rules. To be sure, individual extremist voices are often heard from the party’s rank-and-file.<p><p>There are deeper currents in the Finnish psyche where the party has recently managed to strike a chord. Being a Finn ultimately entails suspicion of, or even detest for, the powers-that-be. The social protest that materialised in the ballot boxes was, to name a few ingredients, a cocktail of EU bailout funds, election financing scandal and an extremely unpopular law that forces the Finns to build expensive sewage systems for their beloved summer cottages.<p><p>Soini himself has called the “True Finns” a “working-class party without socialism.” There is definitely something to that. When the leading Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat asked the candidates a set of questions, the answers of the “True Finns” and the Social Democrats stood closest to each other, out of all the parties.<p><p><p><p>The “True Finns” did not come out of the blue. The party has existed for more than 50 years – though previously under two other names.<p><p>The “True Finns” have rocked the Finnish political scene before, though they were called the Finnish Rural Party back then. That happened in the early 1970s and in 1983. On both occasions, the party either disintegrated soon after due to internal squabbles or took a nosedive after a spectacular showing in the elections.<p><p>The party platform has never been rich in content, but most often it has been chaired by a leader with political talent, charisma and good oratory with witty sound bites.<p><p>Soini, 48, fulfills that description to the letter. He holds a masters degree in social sciences and rather fittingly did his thesis on populism.<p><p>Soini, in an oracular fashion, wrote in his autobiography in 2008 that “a populist leader often comes to the scene when social modernisation and structural change constitute a threat. The populist electorate is made of people afraid of being trampled upon.”<p><p><p><p>Soini learnt the trade working in the party under the rocky leadership of the late Veikko Vennamo, the founder of the two preceding incarnations (the Small Peasants’ Party of Finland in 1959 and the Finnish Rural Party in 1966). Vennamo’s trademark was fiery oratory; once he was even carried off of the parliamentary podium when he exceeded a time limit.<p><p>Vennamo founded the party in the late 1950s after he resigned from the what is now the Centre Party following a bitter fight with Urho Kekkonen, who went on to serve as president of Finland from 1956 to 1982.<p><p>After the Second World War, Vennamo formed a key figure when evacuees from Karelia, the eastern Finnish region annexed by the Soviet Union, were resettled in Finland. It is widely considered that Finland avoided post-war social upheaval thanks in part to the resettlement.<p><p>The ups and downs started in 1970, when the party snatched 18 seats in the 200-member Parliament. The party soon split and disappeared into political oblivion before making a comeback in the 1983 elections. The party entered a coalition government for the first time in its history, then gradually fell back again into the political wilderness.<p><p>That period came to an end a few years ago, when the “True Finns” started to make headway. The first signs were seen in the local elections in 2008 and in European Parliament elections in 2009. Soini was elected to European Parliament by a landslide.<p><p>By Kyösti Karvonen, May 2011<p><p>Suspicion and sewage<p><p>Afraid of being trampled<p><p>From peasants to Parliament<p>", "time": "2015-03-30T11:04:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

The beautifully crafted textiles, rugs and pillows gain their unique look and feel from the century-old skills and knowledge of the local artisans in rural India.<p><p>The woman behind Tikau is designer Taina Snellman, whose trips to India and interest in ethical and environmental production brought her the idea of combining Scandinavian aesthetics while cherishing local artisan work and traditions. The philosophy at the heart of Tikau is also to create design that is as socially, aesthetically and environmentally sustainable as possible. Tikau itself is a Hindi word meaning long lasting, durable and sustainable.<p><p>The values of Tikau are implemented at every stage of production. In contrast to mass production, which begins with the product and then seeks a producer, Tikau is based on the skills and traditions of the local artisans and the local materials. Snellman and the maker start to plan how a product would fit Scandinavian aesthetics. Some of the products have been designed by Snellman herself, some by other designers and some are creations of the craftspeople themselves. Traditional patterns and materials are often used.<p><p>Tikau products are made of natural materials and colours.

We visit Ressu Comprehensive in Helsinki to find out.<p><p>Since 2007, the education at Ressu Comprehensive School has been based on a combination of Finland’s national core curriculum and the PYP curriculum (Primary Years Programme) and MYP curriculum (Middle Years Programme) of the International Baccalaureate Organization, IBO. With 430 pupils, 44 full time teachers, 38 different nationalities and two full-time special-needs teachers, Ressu takes pride in 120 years of heritage and in its mission and strategy as an IB school in Helsinki.<p><p>“It is good that our curriculum, written by our own teachers, has both programmes, because the Finnish national curriculum is an excellent one anyway,” explains principal Erja Hovén. “Now we have one curriculum that fulfils both programmes. It couldn’t be better!”<p><p>Finland has a total of 17 IB schools, including comprehensive and upper secondary, of which two are private and the rest are state-funded schools. Ressu and five others are situated in the Helsinki metropolitan area.<p><p>Ressu students don headphones for comprehension exercises in the language lab. Photo: Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva<p><p>Stimulating problem-solving skills and interaction are elements for which the Finnish school system has often received praise. “Problem-solving is an element that was already incorporated in the Finnish national curriculum. We just emphasise it more in our IB programme.”<p><p>“Certain points have had to be stressed [since the IB programme was introduced at Ressu]. For instance, there are more hands-on projects and enquiries. Our students now work with larger projects or personal projects that can take a whole winter.” Hovén pinpoints their “holistic approach” to education, especially in the PYP.<p><p>Emphasising strong self-esteem and an active and responsible role in society is what Ressu aims for, which is also in accordance with the original aim of the IB programme to “challenge schools to encourage the students in become inquiring young people, active and knowledgeable lifelong learners through intercultural understanding.”<p><p>In addition, Ressu focuses on learning skills and teamwork, which are “just as important as the result,” says Hovén. “We want our students to be critical, to be able to analyse and evaluate the information they receive. Sometimes knowing how to process information is more important than the information itself.”<p><p>As in many IB schools, instruction is offered in two languages, the country’s official language and English. Ressu has both Finnish and English language streams. Often the students attending the English stream are temporarily living in Finland, or they are Finnish but have lived abroad.<p><p>The stellar results that Finland’s educational system has received in international evaluations in recent years have given the Finns cause to celebrate more than once. In the newest test results from the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), released in December 2010, Finland dropped from first place in literacy to second place among OECD participants and third place among all participants, placing it just behind South Korea. And even if Finns are now feeling a certain sense of dissatisfaction about missing their beloved first place, it’s still an excellent result considering that the 2009 survey covered the OECD’s 33 member states and 32 non-members. Finland placed second out of all participants in the science category and sixth in mathematics.<p><p>“Of course we like to get high scores,” says Hovén. “It also motivates us.

With it come plenty of special events which make the most of the ample hours of daylight and, if one is a little lucky, sunlight too. Water plays a significant part in many of these programmes, typically as a backdrop for the countless lakeside summer cottages.<p><p>For one group, water is the medium and the message – or if not the message, it can certainly be seen as a type of massage, for the body and the mind. From the middle of May the church boat crews wait for the lake ice to melt so they can take to the water in these elegant wooden rowboats, and start getting in shape for long summer days and longer rows ahead.<p><p>In times gone by, these elegant, long boats took up to 50 parishioners from distant farms and hamlets located near the many lakesides to the important Sunday services, with all able-bodied persons taking their turn at the oars.<p><p>The journeys were sometimes more than a day’s travel, and when the weather turned bad the consequences could be catastrophic. Swimming was not a common survival skill. Nowadays church boats’ use is purely recreational, offering a combination of application and exercise in a highly social setting and attracting a broad cross-section of people, sat in pairs down the 12-metre craft, 14 at a time.<p><p><p><p> Some crews are obviously highly athletic and have been training through the winter, indoors on the rowing machines or outdoors on the ski tracks. Others take to the water in spring primarily to get outside and enjoy some gentle exercise where the air is the freshest, and the elements the freest.<p><p>Mother of two Eve-Liisa Virehausz, who rows on Järvenpää Lake with the club there, says, “It gets me out and away from all the daily grind. I’m not so worried about the weather – it’s such a different environment out on the water that I’m refreshed whatever it’s like.”<p><p>Exercise is part of the attraction, and coordinating it with the rest of the crew is both a challenge and a reward. Everyone gets a kick out of harmonising their efforts to move the boats efficiently and smoothly along – as well as enjoying the views of the countryside.<p><p>Opportunities to join one of these crews obviously depend on location, with most clubs and boathouses located on lake- or shoresides in southern and eastern Finland. Many groups are sponsored by companies, part of fitness promotion projects typical of modern enterprises; others are vestiges of the original congregational rowers, with the boats owned and maintained purely by local enthusiasts. Crews also gather at regattas held throughout the country, testing their skills against each other and enjoying the community of like-minded spirits partaking in this essentially traditional Finnish survival skill.<p><p>Though the season begins at the end of May, most events are held in July and August.

This meant providing direct, tangible help at grass-roots level: small loans, education in entrepreneurship and vocational training.<p><p>Attitudes also had to be changed, since in many countries women are not thought of as independent entrepreneurs and leaders. According to the Women’s Bank ideology, gaining approval for women’s entrepreneurship is the most efficient way of decreasing poverty in the world, as women and girls often form a forgotten resource.<p><p>Today Women’s Bank is active in 12 countries on three continents, receives donations from corporations and private citizens, and is managed in cooperation with volunteers and Finn Church Aid.<p><p>Photo: Elisabet Back/Kirkon Ulkomaanapu<p><p>In Asia, Women’s Bank is active in Cambodia and Nepal, operating primarily by financing village banks. Village banks operate in rural communities where financing services with reasonable interest rates are frequently out of reach for poor families. Village bank members are local women who, after receiving basic training in savings and loan operations, manage the bank themselves. The interest rate for loans is low and the local area benefits. Women have proved to be trustworthy clients: almost 100 percent of the loans are paid back on time.<p><p>Village bank projects are accompanied by educational programs: People are offered both counseling in financial skills and practical training such as farming cash crops or tailoring. “Merely handing out money is not a solution to poverty’, stresses Hanna Kallio, the head of communications group, \"we believe that giving advice, education and a small start-up loan in the beginning will be much more effective in the long run.\"<p><p>In 2010 the Women’s Bank gained momentum. In 2009 fund had managed to collect one million euros in Finland, and the following summer another million was raised.

Finnish fans of bat and ball rejoice when the snow melts and the season starts.<p><p>On a warm summer Saturday afternoon in Kaisaniemi Park, close to Helsinki’s main railway station, a strange and alien activity is in progress. A small baffled crowd of Finns is gathering on the edge of a dry sand pitch occupied by crouching men in white shirts and trousers. Some of these men are wearing huge pads on their legs and carrying long pieces of wood. Others are throwing balls at them in a vicious over-arm motion.<p><p>The Finnish cricket season is in progress and members of the Helsinki Cricket Club (HCC) are doing what they’ve been waiting all the long, snowy winter to do. HCC, with about 30 active members, is one of 21 clubs across the country listed by the Finnish Cricket Association. “Many of our members at HCC are from or have links with South Asia but there’s an annual turnover with members coming from the UK and Australia each year,” says Zahoor Khan, the Indian secretary of HCC, who has lived in Finland for more than seven years.<p><p>Growing in popularity: Helsinki Cricket Club is one of 21 teams across Finland.Photo courtesy of HCC<p><p>The rules, tactics and jargon of cricket are notoriously difficult to explain – the HCC describes the game economically as “a sport played with bat and ball, in an open ground, between two teams of 11 players” – but Zahoor says this does not deter Finns from getting into the game.<p><p>“The Association runs programmes for Finns, or for anyone else who wants to find out more,” he says. “In fact the actual membership of the HCC is 60 percent Finnish because there are so many second-generation Finns from cricket-playing countries. There’s been a lot of effort put into training young people – my own kids are starting to get more interested now too.”<p><p>Competitive cricket in Finland is played in three main leagues: the SM50 League (with 50 overs for each team in a game) of which HCC were 2010 champions; the second level SM40 (40 overs); and the T20 “express” version, which has been gaining popularity internationally. The Finnish cricket season runs from May until early September.<p><p>Cricket freaks who would otherwise be deprived of their bat-and-ball fix during the winter play in an indoor league – HCC are reigning champions of that as well. The indoor season runs from early December until early April.<p><p>The test-match format, which can run to five days when top international sides are competing, is not played in Finland. Test-match cricket is considered the ultimate version by aficionados, but Zahoor does not envision the Finnish national side reaching such heights in the foreseeable future.<p><p>Even so, he points to Finland’s third-place finish in the 2008 European indoor cricket championships as a sign of a parallel rise in cricketing popularity and ability. The games were held in Kuortane in western Finland – the most northerly location ever for an official cricket tournament. Meanwhile, a new official ground is being prepared for national and club cricket in Kerava, near Helsinki. “I’m realistic, but a lot of kids are being trained now and I really think cricket is going to get more popular here,” says Zahoor. “After all, there are similarities between the game and the Finnish official summer sport pesäpallo (a version of baseball). Finns who come and play never give up the game.”<p><p>A far cry from ice hockey: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, right, at bat in the Cricket World Cup final against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, India in April 2011.Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/Lehtikuva<p><p>Zahoor, like every other cricket fan in Finland, is frustrated at the absence of live cricket coverage on TV channels in Finland – a frustration that reached a peak in the early months of 2011 when the tenth ICC World Cup was played in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.<p><p>Zahoor watched the progress of his native India to victory in the final on the internet.

I don’t see why Finland can’t be at that level in ten years’ time.” Zahoor is philosophical about the lack of televised cricket in Finland. “It’s very frustrating but that’s how it is.

The best sites, equipped with spacious hides for “casual” watchers and more basic, strategically placed hides for serious photographers, are close to the border.<p><p>Bears are attracted by bait of fish, pig carcasses and dog food. On the face of it, this sounds like cheating, but the animals never become totally dependent on the bait or dangerously attracted by it to populated communities – and the chances of seeing the animals in the wild would otherwise be very low indeed. Bears and wolverines might wander boldly to within a few metres of the hides; wolves are more cautious and sightings, though possible, are rarer.<p><p>Wildlife watching trips, under the regional Wild Taiga umbrella, are organised by wildlife experts such as Lassi Rautiainen, an award-winning wildlife photographer.

Or should we ensure that kids are divided early into different educational focuses, as they do in Germany? The principal of Helsinki’s German School says – as do many of his colleagues around the world – that you can learn a lot from Finland.<p><p>In 2011 the German School celebrates its 130th anniversary. It’s the oldest foreign-language private school in Finland, but is also fully recognised and cofunded by the Finnish authorities. More than two-thirds of its students are Finnish.<p><p>Weber believes Finland has recognised that well-being forms a prerequisite for meaningful learning. This is also linked to a greater emphasis on pre-empting problems. \"By comparison, students fall through the cracks more often in Germany before someone notices and considers how to help them,\" says Weber, who taught mathematics for ten years at a comprehensive school in North Rhine Westphalia.<p><p>In contrast to Germany or the US, Finland has virtually no private tutoring market, but the school regards itself as responsible for its students and organises similar services. \"So children get help while there is still a real chance,\" Weber says.<p><p>Other advantages that he notices include the consistently high quality of teacher education in Finland and the highly motivated teaching force. But why are teachers in Finland more motivated?<p><p>Photo: Sari Gustafsson/Lehtikuva<p><p>\"Teachers are well respected here,\" says Weber. \"That strengthens their sense of self-worth. This really takes some getting used to for teachers arriving from Germany. First they have to learn to deal with receiving praise for their work.\"<p><p>The German School has an excellent reputation, and many education-oriented Finnish parents enrol their children there to work toward the widely recognised German school-leaving examination and grow up bilingual. However, the school has also borrowed quite a bit from the Finnish system.<p><p>\"We look to select and combine the best aspects of both systems. Our school also employs addition personnel: a healthcare specialist, two special-needs teachers and a school welfare officer. And I’m very proud that in 2009 a school psychologist joined our establishment.\"<p><p>Things that are common in Finland would be considered a luxury in Germany.<p><p>Even if reading levels have dropped slightly in Finland, particularly among boys, according to the newest OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study, the Finns are still far stronger than many other countries. Weber believes that there is more to it than the Finnish affinity for reading and the many excellently equipped public libraries, which make reading fun.<p><p>Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>\"Many children begin reading aloud while they’re still toddlers. There is also another secret: television. In many other countries, programmes are dubbed, but in Finland they are subtitled. The children are forced to read fast if they want to understand what’s going on.\"<p><p>However, in a country where the emphasis is on integration rather than singling people out, where equal opportunity is a priority and where no one is supposed to be overlooked, is it possible that some above-average children go unnoticed?<p><p>\"No,\" says Weber. \"In discussions with colleagues from other Nordic countries, we’ve determined that in Scandinavia there is a sort of reluctance to put any child before the rest of the group. But in Finland I haven’t seen that. They look at it from all angles.\"<p><p>For the head of the German School in Helsinki, there are many things you can learn from Finland, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t things that Finland could learn from other countries, as well. One of these areas might be approaches to students who come from an immigrant background, he suggests.<p><p>By Rebecca Libermann, March 2011<p><p>The best of both systems<p><p>Another secret<p>", "time": "2011-03-04T07:41:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

They get plenty of it, after all.<p><p>Finns are even keener than most to know what the weather is going to do. In the harsh winters, it’s a question of national economy, even survival, of Baltic Sea ice cover and traffic conditions.<p><p>During the fleeting summer it’s a question of factors affecting the growing season on one hand and, on the other, of how to allocate precious vacation: the reliably clement beaches of Thailand or the lakeside Finnish summer cottage?<p><p>The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), founded more than a century ago, is charged with the responsibility of imparting information about the whims of the Finnish climate. The fact that this climate is changing, for whatever reason, means that FMI is increasingly engaged in researching long-term scenarios – an area of expertise that has attracted interest and business from around the world.<p><p>“We have invested a lot in the last two years to increase our consulting service activities,” says Harri Pietarila, head of consulting services at FMI. “We’ve established a dedicated unit, increased manpower and increased the number of projects and subsequent income significantly. It will be a rising trend through 2011 at least.”<p><p>As the economic and social results of climate change, such as agricultural yields and natural resource availability, fall into sharper focus, governments are recognising the need for accurate forecasts and better preparations for extreme weather events. “There is an increasing global demand for better meteorological and climate data and services,” says Pietarila. “So we are in a very competitive and growing market worldwide.<p><p>Sea smoke: On a cold winter morning, fog drifts over the open sea past frost-decorated vegetation on the island fortress of Suomenlinna, outside Helsinki.<p><p>“Almost all of our projects and work are related to climate change,” he continues. “Observation networks; climate projections; adaptation advice; early-warning system and disaster risk reduction projects; weather and climate production systems – we offer them all. International cooperation takes the form of commercial consulting projects, research projects, bilateral cooperation with sister organisations, and exchanges and cooperation between experts and scientists.” Governments, companies and other meteorological institutes all benefit from FMI’s expertise.<p><p>FMI’s projects extend from the Balkans to the Caribbean and from Central Asia to the Pacific. A project in Nepal and Vietnam, for example, will help those countries to prepare for dangerous weather events causing flooding and landslides [full disclosure: the project receives funding from the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. Such non–profit-making projects are carried out under the Institutional Cooperation Instrument (ICI), which facilitates the participation of government institutes and agencies in development cooperation. FMI has other similar projects in progress in Peru on a number of Pacific islands.<p><p>Income from the institute’s commercial activities is close to half of FMI’s total chargeable income, including that from activity required under Finnish public law, rising from a little more than 4 million euros in 2006 to 6.2 million in 2009. According to Pietarila, FMI has several competitive advantages from a commercial consultative perspective, as well a head start over other meteorological institutes.<p><p>“We offer a better organisational structure, a better system for production delivery covering the whole chain from observation to end products, and customer orientation. FMI is both a service and research organisation, while most of our sister organisations are only service organisations, so we always have the best research information available as well as high-end systems for service. And we have good connections and partnerships with Vaisala, the world-leading Finnish manufacturer of meteorological instruments.”<p><p>Every nation likes to talk about its weather as if it’s a defining national characteristic, like the local language. In reality, of course, the climate and its short- and long-term phenomena and consequences have no respect for borders.

It cuts more than two hours off the line’s former end-to-end travel time.<p><p>For years now, passengers on Finnish domestic lines have been able to crisscross the country on Italian-made Pendolino trains at speeds of up to 220 kilometres per hour. The line between Helsinki and Saint Petersburg – formerly covered by the Finnish train Sibelius and its Russian counterpart the Repin – had begun to look outdated.<p><p>In 2006, Matti Vanhanen, then prime minister of Finland, and Vladimir Putin, then president of Russia, decided to create a high-speed service between the Finnish capital and the former city of the tsars. VR (Finnish National Railways) and the corresponding Russian organisation RZD took the next step, signing the project into life in November of that year.<p><p>The line has been totally revamped. The trains sport double-glazed windows, air conditioning and new safety features, and are undeterred by temperatures from 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) down to minus 40 degrees. The Allegro also offers a much smoother ride – at speeds that equal the Pendolino.<p><p>Infrastructure improvements include more than 300 kilometres of upgraded track, as well as new platforms. Despite the global economic downturn, work was completed ahead of schedule in November 2010.<p><p>The Allegro’s seven coaches can accommodate 344 first- and second-class passengers. Adjustable seats, folding tables, footrests, wifi and power sources for laptops and phones all contribute to travellers’ comfort. The conductors speak Finnish, Russian and English.<p><p>There’s something for kids, too: The train contains a play area, as well as changing tables for babies. There are special seats for passengers with pets, and a specially equipped coach with seating for people who have disabilities. The only people who will feel left out are smokers – the whole train is non-smoking.<p><p>Officers complete customs formalities while the Allegro is in motion, eliminating the need to wait at the border.Photo: Sari Gustafsson<p><p>In order to eliminate the need to wait at the border crossing, customs officers maintain an onboard office and take care of all formalities while the Allegro is in transit. Currency exchange and tax-free refund services are also available.<p><p>A second-class ticket from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg on the Allegro costs 84 euros, which some people find steep. The partners are counting on the advantages of rail travel to play their part in attracting customers: You journey from one city centre to the other, rather than utilising airports located outside of town, and you dispense with airport queues.<p><p>The new, shorter travel time also makes the train competitive in terms of total trip duration. And unlike a plane, the Allegro stops along the way in Pasila, Tikkurila, Lahti, Kouvola, Vainikkala and Viipuri (Vyborg), increasing access for non-Helsinkians.<p><p>By Anna Liukko, December 2010<p><p>Comfort, customs and competition<p>", "time": "2010-12-17T13:12:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

This daycare centre is located on the ground floor of a small block of flats in Tapiola, a suburb in Espoo just west of Helsinki.<p><p>Emerging from snowsuits, knit caps and mittens are children ages three to six – some sleepy, some ready to play. The large, well-lit space is equipped with kid-sized furniture, shelves lined with books, games, toys, instruments and arts and crafts supplies.<p><p>First on the schedule is breakfast, before getting together in the morning circle in the largest room. \"What day is it today?\" asks assistant director Eeva Sorvari. \"What kind of weather is it?\" Hands go up, and those in the know take turns answering.<p><p>Each of the centre’s 24 kids takes a turn as \"child of the week.\" When the big week comes, the child tells the morning circle about him or herself and his or her family. Satusoppi has a focus on the arts, so the staff also chooses an \"artist of the month,\" whose life and work the youngsters learn about.<p><p>The morning circle is a way of uniting the group and a time to learn. The children learn numbers; how to read simple words; concepts of time; seasons; and current events. And even the youngest learn how to sit quietly and concentrate during this shared time.<p><p>Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>Because Satusoppi emphasises the arts, it has partnerships with a nearby modern art museum, an orchestra, a music academy and a puppet theatre. From time to time, the kids go on field trips. Recently they had a chance to try out the playful furniture of world-renowned designer Eero Aarnio, and to draw with the maestro himself.<p><p>When comparing drawings with Aarnio, one little girl confided, \"That looks like a bunny, even though I was trying to draw a puppy.\" Aarnio replied, without missing a beat, \"Oh, don’t worry. Sometimes when I set out to draw a table it ends up being a chair.\"<p><p>The same week that Aarnio drew with the kids, he was awarded the Pro Finlandia medal for his life’s work, as well as a Green Good Design from the European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies and the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design. The latter award, presented for a space divider known as the Tree, is intended to draw attention to environmentally friendly, socially responsible design.<p><p>The Satusoppi daycare centre is part of the Finnish early childhood education system. By law, every preschool-age child has a subjective right to a spot at a municipal daycare centre after his or her parents have taken their maternal and/or paternal leave. Since most mothers work, daycare services are generally used by all kinds of families.<p><p>Even after parental leave, mothers and fathers have the right to stay at home to take care of a child on unpaid leave without losing their jobs, at least until the child reaches the age of three. This right is enshrined in the Employment Contracts Act.<p><p>Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>There are plenty of options: family daycare providers, who take care of small groups of children in their homes, as well as private and municipal daycare centres, which may have a variety of educational emphases. At the age of six, each child has the right to free pre-primary education, which often takes place at a daycare centre.<p><p>After their morning gathering, the Satusoppi kids split up into three groups according to age. The oldest group, the six-year-old preschoolers, are already systematically learning school skills. It is important that when they start school – the same year they turn seven – the children know how to do things like tie their own shoelaces, cross a street safely and even peel their own boiled potatoes at lunchtime.<p><p>Many also surreptitiously learn to read, write and do simple arithmetic. Drawings of barnacle geese make it clear that the Satusoppi children are learning about nature as well. They play outside every day in a nearby park and eat lunch and an afternoon snack at daycare. The youngest ones can also take naps.<p><p>Satusoppi is a private daycare centre backed by an association. It has a contract with the city of Espoo, which funds its operations, and it’s open to children from all families in the area, regardless of socioeconomic status. The fees for daycare – whether operated or outsourced by municipalities – are set nationally and adjusted according to family income. For the lowest-income families, there is no charge, while the highest rate is 254 euros a month. The fee includes meals. The actual cost of the care is about 1000 euros a month per child, with the difference being paid by the local municipality.<p><p>Society at large also invests in early childhood education through the higher education of daycare staff. The director of each centre must have a kindergarten teacher’s degree, which is a lower university degree. Generally, all daycare centre employees are required to have formal training in the field. Group sizes are limited to ensure that each child is safe and receives sufficient attention to his or her needs. Satusoppi has a staff of five adults including one who is primarily a cook. If there are tears during the course of the day, there is always a lap to curl up on.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, December 2010<p><p>World-class art education<p><p>Subjective right to daycare<p><p>Highly educated staff ensures quality <p>", "time": "2011-08-17T07:28:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

They also typically want to investigate out how wood energy business models work in practice.”<p><p>Wenet has welcomed budding energy entrepreneurs from Canada and Japan, as well as visitors from around the EU and Russia.

The Pori Jazz Festival is in full swing and the strains of saxophones and a jangly piano drift up from the riverside Jazz Street. Beer Hunter’s tables are filling up and so are the punters’ glasses – but the refreshment here has a bit more character than the gassy vehicle for alcohol on sale at the town’s other bars.<p><p>Beer Hunter’s is at the vanguard of a small brewery movement in Finland that offers a welcome alternative to the generic, characterless excuse for beer churned out by certain Danish and British international corporate giants. The brewery stationed at the back of the bar produces 20,000 litres of its own Mufloni brands. It’s a drop in the flavourless ocean of the big beer boys, but it is eagerly supped by drinkers who like their beer for its character as much as its alcohol-delivery function.<p><p>“Most people who come here still drink Pori’s old local brand, Karhu, but that is now owned by Carlsberg and produced in Kerava near Helsinki,” laments Mika Heikkinen, Beer Hunter’s owner-manager. “We cannot compete with the big breweries but there is a young culture growing for fine beers on tap.”<p><p>Homegrown delicacies such as Mufloni pull their weight alongside Czech and Belgian brews.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Switch to a new scene: Jari Tapanainen, marketing manager of Suomenlinnan Panimo (Suomenlinna Brewery – the biggest brewery within Helsinki’s city limits, even though it’s located on the eponymous island in the city’s south harbour) is holding fort at the company’s stand at the annual Big Beers, Small Breweries Festival. “Small breweries only account for about 1 percent of total beer consumption in Finland,” says Tapanainen. “But it’s taking big steps every year. More Finns want more from their beer, they like the taste of hops, the character that the bigger breweries can’t give.”<p><p>Step into one of Helsinki’s specialist bars on a Friday night and this interest becomes as clear as the head on a pint of stout. Some of the draft beers at the biggest of the lot, Oluthuone Kaisla (oluthuone means “beer room”), are quaffed at the sobering price of seven or even eight euros for a half litre, but the line at the bar remains long and eager.<p><p>It’s a similar scene at the beer restaurants such as Janoinen Lohi (Thirsty Salmon) and its cousin establishments around Helsinki – all named after different fish – and at William K., a pub chain where the produce of Finnish microbreweries sits comfortably beside Czech and Belgian imports.<p><p>Other good local Finnish beers have nudged aside the corporate standards on the supermarket shelves.

{"title": "Roughing it in exotic Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/roughing-it-in-exotic-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>What’s it like to lead the adventuresome life of a travel guidebook writer in a wild and cool country like Finland? And what’s the best thing about the Finns? We ask Roger Norum, co-author of the all-new Rough Guide to Finland.<p><p>Roger Norum is feeling good as he shows off the first edition of the Rough Guide to Finland, hot off the press. “I really do feel like I have the best job in the world,” he says. “I tried an office job but I was unhappy.”<p><p>He has written for Rough Guides about Mexico, Sicily, Paris, West Africa and Denmark, but Finland holds a special place in his heart. A New Yorker who now lives in London, he recounts how “Helsinki was my first time abroad, if you don’t count three days in Montréal. It was the most exotic place I’d ever been – and still is.”<p><p>So it was that, at the tender age of 16, during a two-day stop-off en route to Russia on a school trip, Norum “fell in love with Helsinki and Finland,” with the wintery cityscape of “neon signs in a bizarre language.”<p><p>Ah yes, the Finnish language – what about it? “You get a lot of insight into the culture even if you do learn just a little,” says Norum. He did put some time into it, long before doing the Rough Guide to Finland: “Finland just became the country I kept coming back to.”<p><p>Part of the Finnish experience: Long-distance skating on natural lake or ocean ice – known as Nordic skating – has enjoyed steady growth in popularity in recent years.© City of Helsinki, Tourist &amp; Convention Bureau<p><p>While writing the book, Norum visited Finland several times for about a month each, over a period of more than a year. “I’d come and do research, take as many notes as possible,” he says, “then come home, wait one or two weeks, and write with a bit of distance.”<p><p>Writing guidebooks requires a surprisingly personal touch. You list the facts, of course, but “you’re writing about what happened to you while you were there,” Norum says. “You learn about a place from that experience and take the reader on that journey with you.”<p><p>“When I saw Helsinki about 20 years ago, it was a very different place and felt very closed to me. I’ve seen it change over that time, and built part of my life here, and I want to share that with others.”<p><p>So what’s his favourite place in Helsinki? His expression shows that this is a tough question, but it doesn’t take him long to answer: Bar 9 [Uudenmaankatu 9]. “That was the place I met the most people,” he says. “Just taking a pen to a piece of paper and looking very studious, people come up to you.” A pause follows. “And weekend brunch at Fanny Bar and Kitchen [Bulevardi 40],” he adds.<p><p>Apart from the capital, though, what part of Finland does he like the best after covering all of southern Finland for the guide? “The Åland archipelago [situated between Sweden and the Finnish mainland] is a very special place, too,” he says. “You feel very much removed from the world. Spending all this time in Finland has made me much more aware of the outdoors.”<p><p>The great outdoors: Finland’s a great place for people who love unspoiled natural scenery such as this view of Ounasjärvi, a lake in northern Lapland.Photo: Pekka Luukkola<p><p>While we’re on the subject of best-of picks, what’s best about Finnish people? “The best thing about the Finns – I’d say it’s their sense of humour,” Norum ventures, well aware that his remark doesn’t fit the tired, out-of-date stereotype of the silent Finn.<p><p>“People here have a real appreciation of the absurd,” he explains. “And they also like awkward moments. I’m a big fan of awkward moments – they take you out of your comfort zone.”<p><p>And what’s the best thing about writing guidebooks – which doesn’t seem to be a get-rich-quick branch of business? “You get to come back every two or three years,” says Norum.

{"title": "The travelling fisherman's Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/the-travelling-fishermans-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finland is a good country for fishing. There are ample bodies of water; two gulfs, the Baltic Sea, about 100 rivers, and tens of thousands of lakes.<p><p>The waters of Finland are still clean, although eutrophication in the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea is becoming a cause for concern. Many types of fishing are practical in Finland, from angling for roach to fly-fishing for salmon. Crowding is no problem, as the country is sparsely populated. As the fish stocks are quite ample, too, it is not surprising that more and more travelling fishermen are heading for Finland.<p><p>Fishing in Finland is regulated through three Fishing Acts and their related decrees. Fishing rights derive from land ownership, with certain exceptions. Fishing waters generally come under the jurisdiction of the local fishing association, which administers fishing rights to jointly owned waters. The legislation on this is about to be amended and may cause certain changes to this situation. In some areas, fishing waters are divided between real estate holdings, or even by the plot. The State, many cities and municipalities, corporations and companies are also major owners of fishing waters as a result of their land holdings. State-owned waters can be found in large lakes and the open sea. The 1996 amendments to the 1994 Fishing Act made it easier and less bureaucratic for foreigners, too, to acquire fishing permits. The autonomous Åland Islands have their own Fishing Act and their own fishing permit procedures. For further information on the Fishing Acts and related matters, contact the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.<p><p>The fishery fee is a type of tax pay able to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. You are not required to pay this fee if you are under 18 or over 65 years old, if you are accompanying fishermen purely in order to row the boat or otherwise assist without handling the fishing tackle; or if you limit your fishing to angling or ice fishing. In Finland, angling and ice fishing are public rights and no permit is required. However, people between the ages of 18 and 64 who fish with lures or fixed nets must pay the fishery fee. In 2002, the fishery fee for the full year is 15 euros and the fishery fee for a fixed period of 7 days is 5 euros. The receipt for payment of this fee must be carried when fishing and shown on demand to the authorities or other persons responsible for supervising fishing.<p><p>There are two options for obtaining a fishing permit. A lure permit for a specific province constitutes permission to fish within the area of that province using one rod, reel and lure. In trolling, you are entitled to also use one heavy trolling lure or trolling sinker. This permit can be purchased for several provinces, specifying which ones, and the fishery fee must be paid. Fishing with a lure permit is subject to certain geographical restrictions. Fishing is prohibited within specific protected areas. In built-up areas, these prohibited zones are signposted on the shores of watercourses, and information on protected zones elsewhere is available from the fisheries units of the Employment and Economic Development Centres. Moreover, a lure permit does not allow the holder to fish on the rapids or groups of rapids of rivers classified as rich in salmon and whitefish or in water areas where fishing is prohibited under other regulations. The latter areas include certain nature reserves. The lure permit for 2002 costs 27 euros for the whole year or 6 euros for a 7-day period of fishing. A lure permit (and the fishery fee) is a personal permit and cannot be made over to a family member. As with the fishery fee receipt, the permit should be carried at all times and produced on demand. People under 18 or over 65 years of age do not require a lure permit.<p><p>Permission from the landowner is a local alternative to a lure permit. Landowners are entitled to give permission to fish in their waters at the price they specify and on condition that you follow their instructions. Many municipalities, such as Helsinki, sell permits for their waters, e.g. permits for lure fishing and fixed nets for local residents and lure permits for visitors. The main owner of sport fishing waters in Finland and also the main permit seller and arranger of fishing trips is the Finnish Forest and Park Service’s Wild North service.<p><p>Many rapids and groups of rapids or stocked lakes have private sport fishing locations established by the local fishing association or landowners; these have their own rules, fees and limits on rods, etc. Information on sports fishing opportunities is available at the Fishing in Finland website.<p><p>Fishing trips are one of the fastest-growing tourist sectors of travel in Finland. Tour operators can be found in almost all towns and their harbours, in hotels and holiday villages and also as independent or self-employed fishing guides. Professional fishing guides can also be contacted through the Association for the promotion of fishing tours in Finland.<p><p>Fishermen coming to Finland should specify their fishing preferences to their own travel agent or tour operator. These will in turn forward the information to the local organization in Finland. If all goes well, the necessary permits and licences, and either guidelines on fishing or a paid guide with programme suggestions in hand, will be waiting for you when you arrive. If you are planning to stay with a Finnish family, fishing should be easy to organize, especially if the family concerned has a summer cottage by a lake or the sea.<p><p>Fishing through the ice is the most popular form of winter fishing. The Fishing Act reform made ice fishing a public right, removing the need for a permit. The few restrictions that do exist concern certain individual sport fishing areas, rapids, fast-flow areas and protected water areas containing salmon and whitefish, the 50-metre protective zones around fixed nets and ice roads, and areas around private homes.<p><p>Increasing numbers of travelling fishermen and women will hopefully start taking advantage of the superb opportunities for ice fishing that are on offer in Finland during the winter. Ice fishing for perch, pike perch, pike and burbot is possible all along the Baltic coastline (Gulf of Finland, Archipelago Sea, Turku Archipelago and Gulf of Bothnia). Further inland, there are plenty of ponds, lakes and waterways that are suited to ice fishing. The local catch includes perch, roach, pike, pike perch, burbot, whitefish, trout, and even grayling. The Lapland fells are a world apart. There, not only large-sized perch, grayling, whitefish and trout can be caught, but the elusive arctic charr can sometimes be enticed as well.<p><p>The technique for ice angling may seem strange at first. The main difference from summer fishing is that you fish vertically through the ice, rather than casting a lure out on the horizontal. First, a small hole is bored into the ice cover. The water visible through the hole is then cleaned of ice skim. The lure is allowed to drop almost to the bottom by letting out the line. Fish are lured to the bait by gently jerking the rod. In clear water, fish are able to spot a lure from dozens of metres away. There are many types of ice-fishing equipment. The sinker mimics the movements of a minnow, and is suitable mainly for catching predatory fish, while the vertical ice-fishing rod is better suited for luring small fish.<p><p>The possible disadvantages of ice fishing include the need to wear suitable clothing, the excessive distances between where you are staying and where you can fish, or even a complete lack of suitable accommodation. Help can be obtained from a fishing guide or the staff of hotels and holiday villages. A substantial selection of winter fishing travel packages are now also available.<p><p>The easiest type of fishing is ordinary angling with worm bait. No permit is needed and it can be done almost anywhere. If you intend to fish with a lure, you will have to pay the fishery fee and either buy a lure permit for a specific province or obtain permission from the landowner if you are between 18 and 64 years old.<p><p>Open-sea fishing offers a number of options: you can obtain access to water through your Finnish host, rent a private cottage, choose accommodation in a hotel or holiday cottage by the sea, join an organized fishing expedition from a sea port or use the services of a fishing guide. Cottages are rented out by Lomarengas and other tour operators. There are separate listings of holiday villages in the Turku archipelago, the Åland Islands and the Archipelago Sea. Boats for fishing expeditions can be hired in Kotka, Loviisa, Porvoo, Helsinki, Hanko, Turku, Naantali, and also places farther north. There are many variations on open sea fishing. You can fish for perch using worm bait or a jig, fish for pike or trout using a plug wobbler or a spoon bait, go fishing for Baltic herring, or go trolling for pike perch. Fly-fishing for pike and trout is another option. Many holiday villages rent trolling boats.<p><p>Fresh-water fishing has been an easy option for years. Here, too, you need a lure permit to give you fishing rights. Cottage rentals may also include fishing rights. Fishing associations such as those centred around Lakes Päijänne, Näsijärvi and Saimaa sell joint permits. These areas have found favour among trollers, in particular. The Finnish Forest and Park Service/ Wild North permit is a good alternative in many areas.<p><p>Fishing for trout, rainbow trout, grayling, and for ocean trout and salmon in selected streams is already possible in certain sport fishing areas. Certain rapids and groups of rapids have been set aside for this purpose (i.e. Langinkoski, Huopana and Ruunaankosket), as have entire rivers (i.e. the Kiiminkijoki, Kuusinki and Tornionjoki). This is also true of lakes where fish are stocked intensively (i.e. Matildanjärvi, Kirkas-Soljanen, and Evon Niemisjärvet). In southern and central Finland, most waters are either privately-owned or are administered by fishing associations. In eastern and northern Finland, sport fishing areas are primarily the responsibility of the Finnish Forest and Park Service/ Wild North. A separate permit is sold for each area, ranging in price from about 5 euros up to 50 euros per day.<p><p>Lapland is a distinctive region, even in summertime. Tens of thousands of fishermen and women undertake a yearly expedition to Lapland, filling their backpacks and disappearing into the woods and fells. Fishing is the primary, but not the only reason for such trekking. The western arm of Finnish Lapland beckons hiking enthusiasts fishing for arctic charr, while Teno Näätämö and the river Tornionjoki attract those fishing for salmon. Lapland has become particularly accessible to fishing enthusiasts in recent years, due to the fact that the Finnish Forest and Park Service/ Wild North has opened up most fell areas for lure fishing, while new fishing tour operators have sprouted up like mushrooms after the rain.<p><p>A minor, but correctable, problem is where to get information on the type of gear needed, and tips on trekking safety and prime fishing locations. Fishing magazines in different countries contain articles on trolling and fly-fishing, and even on ice fishing. Every year, these generally have articles written expressly with beginners in mind. There are also books available on trolling and fly-fishing. However, no general guide to the range of fishing available in Finland has yet been published in translation.<p><p>If you want to buy your equipment in Finland, expertise is available from local fishing shops. These stock everything from rods, reels and line, flies and lures, to jigs and bait, ice drills and waders. This will require an outlay of maximum 10 euros, up to about 340 euros at most, but you might have to spend more if you want to go trolling. However, you should get a lot of good fishing tips into the bargain.<p><p>By Sulo Tiainen, May 2002<p><p>Fishing rights and fishing permits<p><p>Winter fishing<p><p>Summer fishing<p><p>Equipment and instructions on use<p>", "time": "2010-09-22T07:09:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

She and her jogging-guide colleagues are available to trot around town at just about any time that suits foreign visitors’ busy schedules, whatever the weather. Clients appreciate this flexibility, as well as a chance to sightsee without being herded round like sheep. “Businesswomen may especially appreciate local company when walking or jogging in a strange country – even though Helsinki is among Europe’s safest cities,” Laurent says.<p><p>It’s a perfect day to try Nordic walking, a Finnish invention, by the sea in Helsinki.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Tours start in downtown Helsinki.

After simple instructions I soon get the hang of this popular activity, which has many physiotherapeutic benefits for anyone who often sits in meetings or hunched over a computer.<p><p>Laurent is an informative and vivacious guide during our walk. She clearly enjoys sharing her views on all aspects of Finnish life, positive and negative. “I also like to hear foreigners’ impressions of Finland.

Kvarken Archipelago encompasses thousands of islands that are gradually emerging from the sea.<p><p>Unique geology and ecology have led Unesco to place the Kvarken Archipelago, located off Finland’s west coast near Vaasa, on the same list of natural wonders as the Grand Canyon and the Galapagos Isles. The Kvarken Unesco World Natural Heritage Site keeps Finland’s six Unesco World Cultural Heritage Sites company. <p><p>Exhibits at Vaasa’s Terranova Nature Centre illustrate how the massive ice sheet that covered Northern Europe during the Ice Age was more than three kilometres (1.9 miles) thick in this region. The weight of all this ice depressed the Earth’s crust by about a kilometre (0.6 miles). Terranova guide Minttu Kelloniemi explains that though the ice melted away some 10,000 years ago, this part of the crust is still rising on the rebound by about 8.5 millimetres (5/16 of an inch) a year. In geological terms this is a superfast rate of change. <p><p>“Because of the land uplift, we gain a square kilometre [0.4 square miles] of new land from the sea every year,” says Kelloniemi. “That’s enough for 150 football pitches – though the new shores and islands are too strewn with rocks to make good sports fields!”<p><p>Parallel emergent moraine ridge islands are visible beyond Björköby.Photo: Arto Hämäläinen/Mustasaari Municipality<p><p>Geologists reckon that ongoing land uplift will eventually create a land bridge between Finland and Sweden – in about 2,500 years – turning the northern end of the Gulf of Bothnia into a huge lake. <p><p>The rapid land uplift has serious repercussions for local communities along low-lying coasts. “The shorelines constantly change; islands become part of the mainland; and we must keep checking boating routes as treacherous new rocks and islands emerge,” says Roland Wiik, who guides tour groups visiting the archipelago. <p><p>“Over the centuries Björköby’s fishing harbour has had to be moved several times as older harbours were left high and dry,” adds Wiik. “Some local fishermen still use traditional wooden boats of a shallow-bottomed design. And many places where I remember fishing as a child in the 1960s are now dry land covered with trees.”<p><p>A traditional local fishing boat in the harbour at Björköby: As the years pass this area may become dry land and a new location will have to be found for the harbour.Photo: Fran Weaver<p><p>Kvarken has welcomed increasing numbers of visitors since gaining its world-class status in 2006.

Picturesque Porvoo, the second-oldest town in Finland, invites exploration and offers historical treasures, design shops, fashion and fine dining.<p><p>As you arrive in Porvoo, the town’s main landmark is visible: Saint Mary’s Cathedral, a building with origins in the late 13th century. It forms the ideal starting point for your tour.<p><p>The venerable church is rich in history, including coats of arms once used by the local nobility, not to mention medieval paintings and sculptures. This was where Tsar Alexander I convened the Diet when Finland was annexed to Russia as an autonomous grand duchy – an important step in Finland’s eventual progression to independence.<p><p>The aroma of tar hangs in the air in and around the cathedral, a reminder that it has been bombed, burgled and burned many a time – most recently in 2006 in an arson fire. It has been painstakingly restored to its former glory, and a new roof of tarred shingles has been installed.<p><p>The popular, poetic pastry of Porvoo was invented by Fredrika Runeberg, wife of writer J.L. Runeberg.Photo: Porvoo City Tourist Office<p><p>The cathedral is surrounded by a charming old town where some houses are several hundred years old and still standing strong, although there is hardly a right angle to be found. Two of Finland’s oldest streets, Jokikatu (River Street) and Välikatu (Between Street), run past the tradition-steeped Raatihuoneentori (Town Hall Square). Beside Town Hall, the Holm residence forms a museum where you can travel back in time to the Porvoo of centuries past.<p><p>Porvoo once held status as an important cultural centre, and many significant historical figures lived and worked in the town. One of the most central of these was the poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804–77), whose house on the southern edge of the Old Town has been made into a museum. Even if you don’t have time to explore that neighbourhood, built in the neoclassical style, you will surely be able to enjoy a Runeberg pastry at one of Porvoo’s many idyllic cafés. You’ll notice that the pastry, invented by the poet’s wife Fredrika (1807–79), is not the only thing in this town named after the Runebergs.<p><p>Porvoo artist Albert Edelfelt (1854–1905) has also achieved fame; his paintings now sell for hundreds of thousands of euros on the international market. A statue of Edelfelt gazes down from the same hill as the cathedral in the direction of his birthplace. His studio, several kilometres from the city centre, is open to the public.<p><p>From Town Hall Square, you enter a neighbourhood of charming boutiques. Antique stores contain remnants of the old days, and the handicraft shops offer a more original and unique selection of crafts and design items than you’ll find on the Esplanade in Helsinki. The Old Town specialises in toys (both new and antique), handicrafts designed by local artisans and interior decoration items. It’s worth checking out places such as DesignDeli (Jokikatu 41) for ecofashion and Riimikko (Välikatu 8) for toys and doll houses.<p><p>Jokikatu (River Street) and the neighbouring streets offer great shopping and old-time charm.Photo: Porvoo City Tourist Office<p><p>Chocolate is another great Porvoo souvenir gift.

{"title": "Wilderness on the water - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/wilderness-on-the-water/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Archipelago National Park in southwestern Finland is expecting to attract more international tourists after it quietly made history in December.<p><p>After a stringent two-year certification process, Archipelago National Park (ANP) is the first maritime area to be certified as part of PAN Parks, a network of European wilderness areas set up by WWF in 1997. Its ten other parks range from mountainous areas of Sweden, Romania and Georgia to coastal areas in Portugal and Italy. ANP became Finland’s second PAN Park after Oulanka in northern Finland, which was inducted in 2002. So far seven local companies in the archipelago have been certified as PAN Parks partners. These firms – which must meet strict ecological standards and offer multilingual services, feature everything from sailing cruises and handicrafts to dining and lodging. They include the cosy bed-and-breakfast Backaro on the idyllic little island of Nötö, which is accessible by ferry. Backaro innkeeper Nina Björkstén says that as the first summer is just beginning, the PAN Parks partnership has not had much impact on her business yet. “I don’t think people really know much about it yet,” she says. “But I have high expectations for the future. A growing number of people want to holiday in the wilderness, in a way that’s in tune with nature. But it always takes a while for word to get out.”<p><p>“So far the most visible sign of these partnerships is that some entrepreneurs have developed new products,” says Laura Lehtonen, senior planning officer in charge of recreation and tourism at the Finnish Forest and Parks Service. “I’m happy that there are now more chances for people who don’t have boats of their own to explore the park.” “This has really served as a ‘vitamin boost’ to the local entrepreneurs,” agrees Annastina Sarlin, who drew up an ecotourism strategy for the Forest and Parks Service. “It’s been a trigger for them to network better, improve their quality and raise the profile of the archipelago and of ecotourism in general. And it’s helping to ensure that tourism develops on a sustainable basis.”<p><p>Bed-and-breakfast Backaro provides cosy lodging for those who fancy a holiday in the wilderness of the Archipelago National Park.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>A central aim is, of course, to preserve the area’s natural state. The core areas of PAN Parks exclude extractive industries such as fishing, hunting, logging or mining. ANP’s 10,000-hectare core zone is the largest marine-fishing-free area in the Baltic. Seals and waterfowl are also protected from hunters here. The best ways to get around ANP and see its rich wildlife are decidedly environmentally friendly: sailing, kayaking, hiking and biking – as well as diving. People have lived on these islands since the Iron Age, with the permanent population peaking in the 1950s. In recent decades it has become mostly a vacation area with summer cottages dotting tiny islets. The park averages 57,000 visitors annually – a number that is set to rise with the international publicity and enhanced services associated with the PAN Parks certification. Does this pose a threat? “I’m not afraid of there being too many visitors,” says Lehtonen. “It’s not such an easy place to get to, so I don’t foresee any mass migration of tourists into the park!”<p><p>The easiest access is via Kasnäs, 2.5 hours’ drive west of Helsinki (4.5 hours by bus). While not charming itself, Kasnäs has one of the park’s two Visitors’ Centres and is a hub for ferry traffic and tour operators. You can also start at Nagu and Korpo islands, also 2.5 hours by car from Helsinki, (one hour from Turku). They offer tourism firms and an Archipelago Centre. <p><p>By Wif Stenger; June 2010<p><p>Vitamin boost<p><p>Seals and seabirds<p><p>Getting to Archipelago National Park<p>", "time": "2014-06-03T12:08:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Altogether it’s been a very enjoyable way to see this lovely country and meet local people.”<p><p>Several thousand visitors a year flock to Kuusamo for its feathered attractions, including rare woodpeckers, grouses and owls. “Kuusamo has 80-90% of Finland’s key species for birding tourists, as here the ranges of arctic birds and birds of the eastern taiga overlap with those of southerly species,” explains birdwatching guide Olli Lamminsalo.<p><p>Birdwatchers from around Europe regularly flock to Finland to enjoy encounters with exotic birds such as great grey owls.© Jari Peltomäki / Finnature<p><p>Finland’s bird-loving visitors mainly fly in from Britain, Italy, Germany and Spain. “Many come just to find species they’ve never seen before, but with the increasing popularity of digital photography more people are coming to take nature photos,” says Lamminsalo, who also designs hides for nature photographers.<p><p>The highlight of the year for many Finnish birdwatchers is the Kuusamo Bird Marathon.

We talked with her just days before she started her quest.<p><p>“I think people like me have an extra gene that makes us want to do things that don’t make sense. It doesn’t matter how terrible it is while you’re doing it, you go back for more.”<p><p>Carina Räihä is sitting in a café in a shopping mall in an Espoo suburb. Kids are running around screaming nearby; teenagers are munching on burgers. Nothing could feel further from Räihä’s intended goal, the thing that “doesn’t make sense”: to be the first Finnish woman to stand on the peak of Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain.<p><p>Less than two years ago, Carina, who holds a masters degree in economics, was working in a Helsinki city office, absorbing the pressures of the financial world. Most of us only gaze out of the window and dream of leaving the nine-to-five world behind. In Carina’s case, she decided, at the age of 42, to take the biggest challenge of her life.<p><p>“It’s a natural feeling to want to see the top of a mountain, to see what’s on the other side,” says mountaineer Carina Räihä.© Carina Räihä<p><p>“I wanted a change in my life, to do something I really loved,” she says. “In December 2008 I left my job. The idea of climbing Everest came to me last summer. I was at the summer house, enjoying an easy life, walking in the woods, and I could have done anything. But I decided the time was right to fulfil my dream. I thought I might never get another chance.”<p><p>Mountaineering is something of a minority pursuit, and in a relatively mountain-free country like Finland, it’s especially hard to find an organisation that coaches the activity. Finland boasts one male “celebrity mountaineer” in the form of Veikka Gustafsson who in 1993 became the first Finn to reach the summit of Everest and whom Räihä mentions often as an inspirational figure. In terms of female mountaineering, she herself is setting the pace.<p><p>“Only perhaps 10 percent of the total number of mountain climbers in Finland are women, and I know just about all of them,” she says. “There are only a few of us who are crazy enough to do this. It is kind of insane to spend so much money, time and effort to simply climb a mountain and come back. It’s not even as if it’s nice.”<p><p>“It’s miserable, it’s dangerous and it’s very expensive,” says Räihä. “But there is something about mountains that is powerfully attractive. It’s a natural feeling to want to see the top, to see what’s on the other side. But for Everest, you need to be mentally and physically fit. In fact, some say it’s more important to be mentally strong. You have to be able to make decisions on your own and accept being in a dangerous place alone.”<p><p>Part of her physical and endurance training has taken the form of stomping up and down through the deep snow on an artificial hill in Malminkartano, a suburb of Helsinki. Ascending a mere 90 metres in 400 steps may not sound like much when compared with the 8,000-plus metres of Everest, but it’s a tough enough test when you’ve got a 20- to 30-kilo backpack to carry.<p><p>“I don’t mind about the weather,” she says. “I’ll train in any conditions, preparing mentally for the miserable times, because there will be plenty of those.” A yoga and meditation regime also contributes to the preparations.<p><p>Toughing it out: Räihä’s pre-Everest training covers an array of possible situations.Photo: Hanna Saari<p><p>For those of us who get dizzy just thinking of climbing out to clear snow off the roof, the idea of hanging from a sheer rock face seven or eight kilometres above sea level is enough to make us faint. You’d think a head for heights is the minimum requirement for an Everest attempt. Apparently not:<p><p>“I started climbing originally because I did not have a head for heights,” she says. “It is still a challenge. I am still afraid of heights. I think you have to be – it’s natural.<p><p>“This is one of the reasons I want to do it, and how I get something out of it – to look fear in the face. I think it’s something you can get used to. I tell myself to think logically, to concentrate on what I am doing, and then I can manage. It’s dangerous if the fear takes you over. But in a way I live for those feelings.”<p><p>The January 2010 ascent of Mount Aconcagua on the border of Chile and Argentina – the highest peak outside of Asia at 6,962 metres – was Carina’s first climb to more than 6,000 metres, an important psychological milestone. She set off for the Everest Base Camp from Kathmandu in Nepal at the end of March.<p><p>One foot in front of the other: Carina Räihä tells us you need to be mentally and physically strong to make it to the top.© Carina Räihä<p><p>The week-long trek to the base camp and preliminary climbs on sections of the route to the summit helped to adapt to the altitude before the main assault on the summit, which she reached on May 17. The whole expedition – officially called Tango Expedition 2010 in reference to Carina’s main sponsors, and organised by a Canadian outfit called Peak Freaks – took some ten weeks from start to finish.<p><p>Climbers may endure winds of up to 40 metres a second and temperatures as low as minus 40. The lack of oxygen adds to the difficulty in sleeping after daily climbs of eight or nine hours. Continuous nausea removes appetite, while the purified water tastes unpleasant.<p><p>The spell in the chillingly titled “Death Zone” above 8,000 metres can only last for a maximum of two days – it’s too dangerous to spend any longer there.<p><p>“It has been through my mind how I will feel when I reach the summit,” Räihä muses. “When I reached the top of Aconcagua I felt tired and awful. It was only when I got back to the camp that I felt like I’d really done something. As for Everest, this is something I have always dreamed of, and I’m sure there will be some tears.<p><p>“But that’s only half way. Most people who have died on Everest die on the way back. They relax too much – that’s when the accidents happen. But I am not afraid of dying. If it happens – and it won’t – it will be pursuing something I love.” <p><p>By Tim Bird, March 2010<p><p>Kind of insane<p><p>Miserable, dangerous and expensive<p><p>Look fear in the face<p><p>Takes ten weeks to tango<p><p>There and back again<p>", "time": "2010-06-01T11:38:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Put virasto, “authority”, on the end of that and you get Maahanmuuttovirasto, which is what they call the Immigration Service.<p><p>You can also add a great number of word endings – this is a point of contention because some people say this doesn’t count for purposes of finding the longest word. Most of our prepositions (on, at, to, for) are expressed in Finnish by sticking suffixes onto a word. Then you have additional suffixes that mean “also”, “neither”, “my” or “your,” or that symbolise a question. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Really.<p><p>Back to the email: One of the first words to drop into my inbox is apteekkitavaraintarkastuslaitos, meaning “pharmacy product inspection office”.

Some people would claim that this word doesn’t count.<p><p>To make a multisyllabic story short, the quest continues, and we finally arrive at the following 61-character creation, widely accepted as the longest Finnish word (drum roll, please): lento­kone­suihku­turbiini­moottori­apu­mekaanikko­ali­upseeri­oppilas. <p><p>Dear reader, I would love to leave it at that, allowing you to imagine that it means something glorious, artistic and divine relating to famous glass vases on lakeview windowsills in ascetic Northern architecture, but I suppose I’d better take a stab at translating this one, too.<p><p>It refers to someone who is an “aeroplane jet turbine motor assistant mechanic, non-commissioned officer, in training”.

{"title": "Religion lessons support kids' identities - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/religion-lessons-support-kids-identities/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finnish children attend the same schools and classes regardless of their family’s background, wealth or culture. However, for one subject a week children are divided into groups: religion.<p><p>How can you teach religion in school when children come from increasingly diverse homes? Should society be responsible for providing children with instruction in religion? How can you guarantee fairness, equality and level of instruction?<p><p>These questions are being discussed in Finland and all over Europe. Just a few decades ago, nearly all Finns were members of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church, but a significant minority of today’s pupils are non-religious or belong to another religion. At the same time, the state’s relationship with the Evangelical Lutheran Church and, representing the traditional minority, the Finnish Orthodox Church, has dissolved and society has become secularised.<p><p>The relationship between education and religion incites strong feelings. When Finland’s Freedom of Religion Act was amended in 2003, the legislative process included extensive debate regarding teaching religion in school. Those holding fast to traditional values demanded the preservation of denominational religious instruction, whereas more radical elements felt that religious instruction should be eliminated altogether. The compromise resulted in the concept instruction in one’s own religion, which strives to guarantee the rights of minorities and to ensure that the child receives an education in accordance with their family’s convictions. Non-religious pupils study a subject called Life Perspective Studies, which includes ethics, worldview studies and comparative religion.<p><p>The Finnish compromise stems from the fact that teaching is not denominational, but rather respects the child’s personal background. Religion as a mandatory subject is still considered necessary, because it supports development of the child’s own identity and worldview, which also establishes a foundation for an intercultural dialogue. Because Finland has been homogeneously Evangelical Lutheran since the Reformation, it would be difficult to understand the country’s society and culture without knowing the history and thinking of the Lutheran Church.<p><p>Religion textbooks such as these help children understand the cultural and human significance of religions.Photo: Sari Gustafsson/Lehtikuva<p><p>Religion is taught in comprehensive schools and upper secondary schools for one to two hours a week by the school’s own teachers or experts hired on a temporary basis. Minority-religion study groups are offered if there are at least three pupils of the same denomination in the school. Curricula for different religions are created jointly by religious communities and educational authorities. The Finnish educational establishment sets high qualification standards for teachers, and finding qualified teachers for minority religions has proven challenging.<p><p>The goal of a religious curriculum is to familiarise kids with their own religion and the Finnish traditions of belief, acquaint students with other religions and help them understand the cultural and human significance of religions. A key part of religious instruction is dealing with ethical issues in way that is appropriate to children.<p><p>In an average class approximately 94 percent of the pupils study Lutheran religion, 3 percent Life Perspective Studies and the remainder are divided into minority religions, such as Orthodox and Catholic study groups. In recent years schools in larger population centres have seen the advent of Islam study groups catering to children from immigrant backgrounds.<p><p>In the Finnish system, teaching is not denominational, but rather respects the child’s personal background.Photo: Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva<p><p>Even though studies show that both parents and teachers are primarily satisfied with religious instruction in schools, discussion on the matter is far from over. One challenge that has risen is how to initiate interaction between children representing different religions. When the same ethical issues are discussed in all religious curricula, is it possible for children to study them together?<p><p>Schools address the meeting of religions and traditions in celebrations held throughout the school year. How do children who do not celebrate Christmas at home participate in Christmas festivities? Do all pupils sing the traditional Finnish hymn at the school-leaving ceremony?<p><p>Bolder steps are taken in multicultural schools, where representatives of different religions hold traditional celebrations and invite everyone to attend. Sharing in the universal joy of celebration and learning about others’ traditions with an open mind poses no threat to any faith. <p><p>By Salla Korpela, April 2010<p><p>Minority religion also taught in small groups<p><p>Sharing neighbours’ celebrations<p>", "time": "2010-04-15T12:48:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

But with a positive attitude and a sympathetic teacher, even the most tongue-tied newcomer can get to grips with Finnish surprisingly quickly.<p><p>We admit it: Finnish can seem intimidating at first sight. Few words look familiar to anyone whose own language is not in the obscure Finno-Ugric linguistic family.<p><p>Even the boldest beginners might feel like giving up when they realise how Finnish words can radically change their shape according to their role in a sentence. Some letters can double, disappear or morph into different letters for reasons that seem obscure to the uninitiated. A simple word like “water” can become unrecognisable when transformed from the basic form vesi to veden, vettä, veteen or umpteen other forms.<p><p>Laura Hartikainen, Finnish language studies coordinator at Espoo’s Adult Education Centre, emphasises that learners can soon make themselves understood in everyday situations. She points out that even if Finnish is a very different language for immigrant learners from every country except neighbouring Estonia, it has a logic of its own that is not inherently difficult.<p><p>“Finnish pronunciation is very straightforward, for instance,” she explains. “Each letter is pronounced in exactly the same way in every word where it appears.<p><p>“For foreigners here, it has to be worth making the effort to learn the language, so as to get deeper into Finnish culture, and understand what’s going on around you,” says Hartikainen, whose students at evening school in Espoo include immigrants from all corners of the world.<p><p>The elusive partitive case is captured and tamed in its own 15-page chapter in “Finnish: An Essential Grammar”.Photo: Laura Waris<p><p>“To learn the language well, students must do exercises, which can sometimes seem boring, but we also have fun playing games, working in pairs and practising realistic dialogues,” she says. “Learners mustn’t be nervous about making mistakes, and we encourage them to go out and actively start talking to people in Finnish.”<p><p>Hartikainen has some useful tips for students keen to talk the talk. Right from the beginning, she encourages them to practise Finnish through their own interests by joining local clubs and reading Finnish magazines and websites related to their hobbies.<p><p>“The clear and simple language used in the Finnish Broadcasting Company’s Selkouutiset [News in Plain Finnish] radio news broadcasts and in Selkokieli [clear language] books available from libraries can also be very helpful for foreigners learning Finnish,” she adds.<p><p>Hartikainen gets a kick out of her work every time learners make a breakthrough. Her students have especially enjoyed learning to recognise amusingly twisted loan words like tohtori (doctor) or pihvi (derived from the word “beef” and meaning “steak”).<p><p>They also gain satisfaction from learning to hear and pronounce tricky double consonants and elongated vowels. Such skills enable foreigners to distinguish tuuli, tuli, and tulli (wind, fire and customs) – or make the subtle but potentially crucial distinction between Tapaan sinut!

{"title": "Finnish foreign policy: a brief intro - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finnish-foreign-policy-a-brief-intro/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finland has always possessed a fascinating and unique foreign policy because of its proximity to Russia. More recently, the Finns have emphasised an active profile in the EU and in global challenges. Hiski Haukkala makes this detailed topic surprisingly easy to read.<p><p>To make a long story short, a state’s foreign policy can be seen to have at least three functions. First, it is a set of actions that a state and its machinery undertake on behalf of a nation to promote and protect its interests using all the instruments it can muster. This can take the form of competition or, as is increasingly case in the contemporary world, cooperation with other actors.<p><p>Second, a foreign policy is used to signal intents: the speeches and diplomatic messages from any given state are meant not only to be deciphered but correctly understood in other capitals and by the general public. Increasingly, the role of public diplomacy is coming to the fore in all aspects of foreign policy and Finland is no exception.<p><p>Third, in addition to interacting with other countries, a foreign policy can also entail changing the very parameters within which such interaction takes place to begin with. For obvious reasons, this has traditionally been the prerogative of Great Powers. For example, in the aftermath of World War II the US sought to create a new international order in the West based on multilateral international institutions. In a similar vein, the US emphasis on promoting democracy in the “Greater Middle East” in early 2000s can be seen as the latest attempt at devising new rules of the game internationally.<p><p>Finnish President Urho Kekkonen (foreground, right) greets US President Gerald Ford on July 29, 1975. Leaders of 35 countries arrived to sign the Final Act of the European Security Conference Summit in Helsinki.Photo: Lehtikuva<p><p>Like any country, Finland has a set of priorities that it seeks to promote – you can call them national interests if you like. The obvious priority is the protection of national security, or what could more pompously be called “the preservation of the Finnish way of life”. Yes, there is indeed such a way of life, and it includes much more than visiting the sauna twice a week. In essence, it means safeguarding the republic and its political institutions.<p><p>But in the 21st century security is, more and more, framed in terms of individuals, and Finnish foreign policy is no exception. So it’s increasingly concerned with the wellbeing and safety of Finnish citizens, or human security. This emphasis was highlighted in the aftermath of the tragic tsunami in Southeast Asia in December 2004, when some Finns were angry with their government for not protecting and helping the survivors better in their distress on the other side of the globe.<p><p>We should bear in mind that Finland is a small country. With a population of 5.3 million it is not exactly a major powerhouse in the global games of brinkmanship. Finland is clearly constrained in its ability to effect change on the wider political and normative structures in the world.<p><p>This is not such a damning conclusion, however. The 21st century seems a rather safe era for small countries like Finland. Although the persistent problems, for example, in agreeing to a new post-Kyoto treaty concerning greenhouse emissions, might be frustrating at times, it is a far cry from the cynical balance of power of the 19th century, which once led German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to remark how the great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions, but by iron and blood.<p><p>Keeping this perspective in mind, it might not come as a big surprise that at the end of the day the biggest international agenda that Finland might have is essentially a rather conservative one: It’s about keeping what you have got while gently pushing for changes in the margins that would preserve and enhance the manoeuvring room of Finland and other small countries.<p><p>Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev (right) and Finnish President Urho Kekkonen sign a programme for trade and the economy at the Kremlin on May 18, 1977.Photo: Hans Paul/Lehtikuva<p><p>In a sentence, the Finnish agenda could be summed up as the promotion of a rule-based world where the power of the strong is constrained by effective multilateral institutions. This is the lesson that can be drawn from the Finnish history: When the power of the strong is constrained by common norms and institutions, manoeuvring room for small countries is also the greatest. Unfortunately the strong do not always want to be constrained, and one way of accounting for the international politics of the last 300 years is to see it as constant ebb and flow between two polar extremes: common norms and values on one hand and the cold logic of power politics on the other.<p><p>In this respect, the fallout from the recent severe global economic crisis has been followed with some concern in Finland. Some have seen it ushering in a new era of multipolarity where Great Power politics will hold sway and small countries will once again be pushed to the margins. Obviously, such a development would not be to the Finns’ liking. If anything, recent developments have only made Finland an even keener promoter of multilateralism and rule-based world order than before.<p><p>Let’s touch upon some key issues in contemporary Finnish foreign policy: the role of European integration, relations with Russia and the growing role of a wider global agenda. But before that, it might be a good idea to say a few words about the overall post–cold war setting of Finnish foreign policy.<p><p>It’s fair to say that almost everyone on Spaceship Earth was taken more or less unawares by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This was the case with Finland as well, which during the cold war had pursued a policy of neutrality geared at maximising its own freedom to manoeuvre: enabling Western economic integration while seeking to preserve the delicate balance of power with the sometimes overweening Soviet Union. Although not entirely unproblematic, in hindsight the policy can be deemed to have worked fairly well.<p><p>The end of the cold war was a systemic shock for Finland, too. The lucrative trade with the Soviet Union collapsed (although painful in the short term, this turned out to be a blessing as it forced the Finns to become much more competitive and innovative on the world markets).<p><p>The old maps of international politics that had served rather well became obsolete almost overnight. In the post–cold war period Finland pursued a new foreign policy course by relinquishing neutrality and replacing it with not being a member in any military alliance, and taking up European integration in full, an option that had been impossible during the cold war due to the political implications in the East.<p><p>In essence, the name of the game during the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s has been Finland maximising its international influence. In practice this has meant securing a seat at the right tables. Admittedly, identifying exactly what the right tables are has not been entirely straightforward, as the perpetual debate about whether or not Finland should seek to join NATO shows. Nevertheless it is the European Union that has become the main forum for Finland in terms of gaining say in both European and global processes that affect the country.<p><p>Participating in peacekeeping: Finnish soldiers in the International Security Assistance Force stand in front of the mountains of Afghanistan in 2006.Photo: Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva<p><p>In the EU Finland has sought an active profile, even a place at the very political core of the Union. This has not, however, been an easy task for a new and fairly peripheral member state. In recent years the dynamic “vision thing” of Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen (1995–2003) has been replaced with the more cautious and issue-specific approach of Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen. To be fair, this might also be a reflection of the radical changes in the internal constitution of the Union itself, which has grown over the past five years from a cosy club of 15 to the current pan-European organisation of 27 member states.<p><p>Interestingly, it seems that lately Finland has been rediscovering its zest for more Europe. In spring 2009 the government published a report on EU policy that was remarkable in its euro-enthusiasm: According to the report, Finland wants more community competences and a vastly enlarged Europe (including Turkey), and aims at a truly global role for the Union.<p><p>This should not be seen as a surprise, nor should the fact that the report coincided with the deep economic crisis and all the speculation about the advent of a new age of multipolarity be seen as a coincidence: Seeking a stronger Europe is a natural response from the part of a small country like Finland – as an influence multiplier the EU is simply unsurpassed.<p><p>Despite the westward drift in Finnish foreign policy, Russia has by no means lost its significance. In fact the reverse is the case, as in recent years Russia’s new-found confidence and economic growth has meant that as an economic and political partner it is much more important now that it was 10 or even five years ago. Currently, in stark contrast to most of the 20th century, Russia is seen more as a possibility and a challenge than an outright problem or threat. That said, Russia’s development still holds several unanswered questions that could spell trouble for Finland in the future.<p><p>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (right) presents a book to Finnish President Tarja Halonen during informal talks in Sochi on August 11, 2009.Photo: Dmitry Astakhov/AFP/Lehtikuva<p><p>According to Finnish scholars Tuomas Forsberg and Tapani Vaahtoranta, Finland can basically be seen as having three different security strategies vis-à-vis Russia. First, strategy of balancing: Russia is too strong a factor in northern Europe and therefore its military presence must be balanced. This is done, firstly, by having a credible defence capability, as the recent government white paper on security and defence policy has put it.<p><p>However, keeping the difference in relative capabilities between Finland and Russia in mind, this might not be enough. Therefore the presence of both the EU and the US in one form or another in the region is needed. Especially the continued presence of the US has been seen as indispensable. So Finnish foreign policy contains some fragments of classical balance-of-power thinking, at least when it comes to Russia.<p><p>Second, the strategy of not provoking Russia: This is rather self-evident. Finland seeks to avoid confrontation with its neighbour. One example is the avoidance of the issue concerning the territory of Karelia – an area that was annexed by the Soviet Union in the Peace Treaty of Paris in 1947. Another is the fact that the questions pertaining to the hard end of the security spectrum are often excluded from Finnish foreign policy agenda altogether.<p><p>Avoiding the issue of NATO membership can be seen as the case in point. Instead, Finland has pursued the policy of not being a member in any military alliance, although at times it is really a line drawn in water, with Finland being an integral part of the EU’s military crisis-management processes and currently taking part in NATO-led operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan. Finally, Finland seeks to promote policies in the North, such as the Northern Dimension, that strictly exclude the realm of hard security and seek multilateral solutions to a host of soft-security–related threats instead. Indeed making sure that the EU and Russia are on each others’ good sides is one of the key aims of Finnish European policy.<p><p>Finally the strategy of strengthening norms and institutions: Finland basically seeks to “tame” the Russian bear once and for all, thus eradicating its historical security dilemma. This strategy, and indeed the very core of the Finnish foreign policy, is driven by the democratic peace theory according to which liberal democracies do not fight wars against each other. Therefore Finland has sought to support the democratisation of Russia while seeking to tie it with many multilateral bonds into the Western security community: the EU, regional councils in the North, the OSCE, Council of Europe, WTO, perhaps even NATO, are all tools that are seen as useful in domesticating the Russian bear.<p><p>To be sure, the brief but hot conflict between Georgia and Russia in August 2008 put a dent in Finnish optimism. It showed that European security architecture is far from foolproof and that the issue of lingering mistrust is still very much present. That said, the Finnish analysis seems to be that there can be no substitute to the well-established principles and practices developed for European security during the past four decades: reinvigoration, not drastic reconstruction, would seem to be the order of the day for Finland.<p><p>To make a generalisation, the strategy of strengthening international norms and institutions is the essence of Finnish foreign policy, not only in bilateral and regional level but also globally. The tradition has its roots in the cold war era when Finland, to paraphrase then-President Urho Kekkonen, saw itself more as a doctor than a judge in international crises.<p><p>Tarja Halonen and her Tanzanian counterpart Benjamin Mkapa talk at a meeting of the Helsinki Process on Globalisation and Democracy. From 2002 to 2008 the Process gathered stakeholders from all over the world to identify ways to improve global governance.Photo: Helsinki Process Conference<p><p>This rhetoric notwithstanding, in reality the bipolar superpower constellations often resulted in a highly constrained freedom of action for Finland. But in the post–cold war era these constraints have largely disappeared and Finland has sought to be a good global citizen in earnest. This has been the case with the so-called Helsinki Process, in which President Tarja Halonen has, together with the President of Tanzania, sought to take the lead in devising new rules for global governance. Finland is also a staunch supporter of the UN and other multilateral management of global challenges. Finland has thrown its hat in the ring to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2013–14.<p><p>At first sight, the idea of Finland as the vanguard for global morality might seem to be a pipe dream. Former Finnish diplomat Keijo Korhonen once quipped how the peaceful coexistence of a lion and a lamb can only be guaranteed by introducing a fresh lamb at regular intervals. This is indeed how we have been used to thinking about world politics and foreign policies.<p><p>Although a world of global justice, equality and wellbeing may seem like a distant prospect at times, it is nevertheless one worth aspiring to. Perhaps the fact that a country like Finland can now find itself in a position where it has the luxury to devote a considerable amount of its energies to these issues speaks volumes about today’s world and the progress already achieved.<p><p>Hiski Haukkala is a special adviser at the Unit for Policy Planning and Research at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland.

Gräsbeck shows us how to dig our toes in and use our poles to support our bold ascent. All of us successfully surmount the precipice, though progress often involves three steps upward and two steps back down.<p><p>Townies from southern Finland are increasingly learning that you don’t have to head up to Lapland to try this exotic but easy-to-learn activity. “Snowshoeing is steadily getting more popular, and after a couple of years when we didn’t get much snow down here, this has been a great winter for the sport,” Gräsbeck notes.<p><p>“What people like about snowshoeing is that you can go absolutely anywhere, on all kinds of terrain,” he explains. “Everyone feels the call of nature sometimes, and it means a lot to people to find their own new place in the fresh snow, away from it all.”<p><p>Located in a converted barn and run by the Finnish Association for Outdoor Activities, Oittaa Recreation Centre rents out winter gear including skis, sledges and modern lightweight snowshoes.

Head for the Esplanade and its environs where you can dine at Michelin-star standards, enjoy a rooftop cocktail, and shop ‘til you drop – all without the crowds, pollution and long travel times that larger cities have.<p><p>A stroll down Helsinki’s picturesque Esplanade is like a walk through past and present. The boulevard was once a political dividing line: Finnish-speaking Finns walked on the south side (Eteläesplanadi) and Swedish-speaking Finns on the north side (Pohjoisesplanadi). Today the political divisions are gone, and the bustling boulevard is a microcosm of domestic and international design, culture and cuisine. Lined with a mix of modern Alvar Aalto-designed interiors and exteriors (Artek, the Academic Bookstore, and the upscale restaurant Savoy), its old-world grandeur is juxtaposed with touches of the Finnish minimalist aesthetic.<p><p>Exquisitely restored to its 19th century riches, the five-star Hotel Kämp hosts international celebrities ranging from royalty to rock stars such as Mick Jagger when they’re in town. It’s also where Finnish greats such as composer Jean Sibelius, artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela and poet Eino Leino held legendary parties that lasted for days. Here, political history was made: the identity of the emerging Finnish nation was blueprinted and important political issues sealed at its tables in the early 1900s.<p><p>Photo: Katja Pantzar<p><p>Adjacent to the hotel, Kämp Galleria houses an array of boutiques. For example, the Moomin Shop sells toys and babywear based on the loveable Moomintroll characters created by Finland’s revered author/illustrator Tove Jansson, while next door, designer Juha Tarsala sells his women’s shoes that are a hit with fashionistas and regular folk alike.<p><p>A lively park runs between the south and north side of the Esplanade. During the summer months free jazz concerts are held on its open-air stage while in December a traditional Christmas market takes over. At the north end lies Teatteri, the hip restaurant, bar and nightclub that takes its name from the Swedish Theatre (teatteri) on the other side of the building. At the south end, historic restaurant and café Kappeli offers a more classic take on afternoon coffee or an evening meal on the glass veranda. Try their Sibelius menu which features smoked arctic char with beetroot mousse as a main.<p><p>For the seasoned shopper, Scandinavia’s largest department store, Stockmann, boasts everything from fresh ciabatta bread flown in from Spain daily to golf equipment and designer watches under one roof. En route to the south harbour via the Esplanade, there are three Marimekko shops, including the flagship store, where the unique, colourful cotton prints and fashions that bring cheer to homes throughout the world are sold. Also on the Esplanade is Artek, founded by Alvar Aalto, Finland’s Frank Lloyd Wright. The shop sells his timeless furniture along with other designs. Iittala has a large shop on the boulevard, featuring its classic designs for glassware and dishes and highlighting its latest styles, while Della Marga (Chanel sunglasses, anyone?), Longchamp, and Rils offer a mix of Finnish-designed and international clothing, bags, accessories.<p><p>Photo: Katja Pantzar<p><p>Café Strindberg is reminiscent of a Parisien café and bistro, with its Burberry-clad clientele and Helsinki who’s who jostling for a table. Nearby, recently renovated Café Esplanad offers more casual fare, but is equally busy with its seemingly never-ending line-up for their scrumptious korvapuusti, a cinnamon bun featuring a unique Finnish touch – cardamum.<p><p>Just off the Esplanade is Mecca on Korkeavuorenkatu, the city’s newest it-spot, a chic lounge and restaurant. Mecca’s founders include Hans Välimäki, whose Chez Dominique around the corner on Ludviginkatu is Finland’s only two-Michelin star restaurant and deservedly so: their Menu Surprise is guaranteed to leave a delicious impression long after the last bite.<p><p>For après shopping refreshments, head towards the harbour and pop up to the Terrace Bar on the top floor of the Palace Hôtel on Eteläranta. The view rivals that offered decktop on the cruise ships that ply the harbour waters below. As the Terrace Bar is only open during the week, head to the intimate Ateljee Bar atop Hotel Torni (about a five-minute walk from the harbour) for a view that some say stretches to Estonia on a clear day. (Ateljee is open seven days a week.)<p><p>Near the Palace Hôtel is the beautifully restored Old Market Hall (110 years old), which offers shelter from the outdoors and everything a market hall could sell from sausage and salmon to fine wines and sushi. Adjacent is the staple of Helsinki tour guides, the Market Square, where vendors hawk their fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and baked goods along with Lappish souvenirs. Ferries for the fortress island of Suomenlinna leave from the cobblestone market’s south end.<p><p>Nearby the Havis Amanda statue, a symbol of Helsinki’s status as daughter of the Baltic, a host of fine restaurants offer dining options, including newcomers Sasso (Italian) and the sleek Fish Market, which is at cellar level.<p><p>From the corner of the Esplanade and Sofiankatu, you can see the open-air museum street which captures bygone days including those under Russian rule, and catch a glimpse of the Lutheran Cathedral, the work of Carl Ludvig Engel (1778-1840) who shaped much of Helsinki’s neo-classical core.<p><p>It’s all in an afternoon’s walk.<p><p>By Katja Pantzar, September 2004<p><p>Addresses:<p><p><p>", "time": "2010-02-09T09:02:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

That’s because this is Helsinki’s open prison, one of 13 across the country.<p><p>The sign on the conspicuously unlocked gate calls it a “labour colony”, but this is a relic from the prison’s previous incarnation. It has been a prison since 1973 and can house 95 male inmates.<p><p>Suomenlinna prison director Tapio Iinatti in a communal kitchen: In some respects the accommodations are reminiscent of a youth hostel.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>“There are all kinds of criminals here except sexual offenders, including four with life sentences who are approaching the end of their terms,” explains Tapio Iinatti, the genial ex-policeman who now directs the prison and heads a 12-strong team of guards. “Prisoners stay with us from six months to two years. The youngest inmates are about 20, the oldest is 79.”<p><p>The single-room, single-storey accommodation includes shared kitchens, toilets, showers and saunas. Giant flatscreen TVs dominate the lounge area, and a barbecue shelter stands near a quiet pond. There is nothing draconian or even severe about this place, but to dwell on its comforts, insists Inatti, is to miss the point of the prison’s philosophy.<p><p>“The main idea here is to prepare the inmates for release into the community. It doesn’t make sense for an inmate to be in a closed prison for, say, six years and to suddenly enter civilian life. We also offer rehabilitation for people who have had problems related to alcohol, drugs or mental illness. And in any case, it’s not so easy to be here.”<p><p>The property is favourably located close to the sea, but those who live here look forward to leaving.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>In fact, they cannot just be here. Prisoners have paid jobs that help them to meet basic living costs, including those for food. Permits for visits to the mainland – even those that include family overnights – are granted on a regular basis, and attempts to escape are limited to a few dozen a year. The public ferry is a ten-minute walk from the prison entrance and this is not exactly Alcatraz, but the incentive to flee is cancelled out by the motivation to stay.<p><p>Some inmates – of whom about a dozen are non-Finnish – are immersed in studies and others even have jobs in the city. Many are employed in renovating the UNESCO-listed fortress buildings and structures of Suomenlinna, Helsinki’s prime tourist attraction. The stonemason skills acquired give them good employment prospects back in the ever-renovating capital.<p><p>Fifty-eight-year-old Pertti, convicted for his involvement in sports doping, has a job as a store man that earns him seven euros an hour. “It’s a good system,” he says. “In any case it has worked well for me. When my sentence is served, it will be better to go back to a normal situation from here than it would be from a closed prison.”<p><p>Iinatti is aware that not everyone approves of the enlightened policy of the Finnish prison system, but his relaxed demeanour does not seem to diminish the respect shown to him by the inmates. He also points out that serious offenders do not start their sentences on Suomenlinna, although he regards his charges as equal and professes not to be interested in their individual offences.<p><p>No objections are raised by the local community, who are more likely to be disturbed by drunken summer picnickers than prison inmates. In any event, the system has attracted attention from authorities as far afield as China and Italy.<p><p>Thirty-eight-year-old Janne, who has just three weeks left of his ten-month sentence for felonious assault, is similarly approving. He has been able to continue his carpentering skills and will get his old job back when he is released. “It’s still a prison,” he says. “Your freedoms are still limited.

{"title": "Trauma portrayed with heroism - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/trauma-portrayed-with-heroism/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The 75th anniversary of the start of the Second World War was commemorated in 2014. For Finland, this means remembering the outbreak of the Winter War. We talk to young Finnish historian Antero Holmila about how that memory is seen from today’s perspective.<p><p>“War in Finland?” Yes. The day after this question appeared as the title of the New York Times editorial on 29 November 1939, the Soviet Union initiated a massive offensive on Finland. The battle would last for 105 days with Finland, much to the surprise of most, remaining independent but ceding about 9 percent of its prewar territory and 20 percent of its industrial capacity to the Soviet Union.<p><p>As elsewhere, the outcome of the worldwide conflict shaped the nation. “The Winter War is always topical when speaking about Finnish self-consciousness” says Antero Holmila, researcher at the University of Jyväskylä with a background in British academia, and editor of a book entitled Talvisota muiden silmin (The Winter War through the Eyes of Others).<p><p>“A nostalgic view of Finland lives through the memory of the war,” says the young researcher. “The war effort showed proof of moral values that were, and still are, held in high regard, such as patriotism and working together for a greater cause.” Holmila seems to say that people dissatisfied with today’s diverse society seek the blueprint for a society that supposedly used to exist. But how accurate is that picture?<p><p>“My first contacts with the Winter War came through skimming picture books, reading fiction and through movies,” says historian Antero Holmila. “Historical literature came much later.”© Atena Publishing<p><p>Holmila does not set out to provoke or challenge, but to seek room for more hues of history and nuances to the tale. Since the war is still strongly a part of Finnish culture and society, he wanted to deconstruct and broaden the scope of the traditional view of little heroic Finland. “I wanted to bring the international narrative to the forefront,” he explains. “Deconstructing national myths is not only a trend among historians, but an important direction to take.”<p><p>Holmila sees the Winter War as a part of European history and as one piece of the bigger Second World War puzzle. “Remembering our war does not differ much from how the Second World War at large is remembered in Europe. Having a last round of veterans and eyewitness accounts brings an added dimension to this anniversary and a chance to use history for politics. Pointing out the importance of the war is also one way of honouring the veterans,” he says.<p><p>First Soviet air raid: On November 30, 1939 Soviet bombers destroyed numerous buildings in Helsinki, killing 91 and injuring more than 200.© SA-Kuva<p><p>Holmila points out that the generally accepted view in Finland is that the outbreak of war was others’ doing. The culprits were the architects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, in effect Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. That view also affects how the entire conflict is discussed and remembered. There is little talk about regret, as there is in Germany, for example.<p><p>That does not mean that the memory of war is unproblematic. “I’d personally like to describe it as a trauma portrayed as an act of heroism. Obviously it is both, but with an emphasis on the former.” The war had hidden effects and the traumatic side has only just begun to be discussed. “The controversy surrounding the Huhtiniemi excavation, an alleged mass grave of Finnish deserters, is a recent example of how strongly people still feel about the war, [more than] 70 years on.” Silenced incidents continue to have a haunting presence.<p><p>“We’ve had a hard time accepting and fitting in suffering and trauma as a part of the success story,” Holmila explains. He also emphasises that it is both difficult and dangerous to generalise when speaking on a collective level: “For some the war, despite all its gruesome aspects, was a truly enjoyable time and a great purpose to live for. For others it was nothing but suffering.”<p><p>Inspecting a Soviet bomber, December 1939: The Finnish Air Force and antiaircraft units downed about 600 Soviet aircraft during the Winter War.© SA-Kuva<p><p>The Winter War did draw wide international attention. Holmila’s book looks into how foreign press viewed the conflict, with examples covering ten countries and three continents. The articles from Greece, Japan, Hungary and Great Britain show that foreign press emphasised and marvelled at the unity of the Finnish nation.<p><p>Holmila again raises a rhetorical finger: “It is important to acknowledge that they did this for their own national and often political purposes.” War loomed over the world and all countries were preparing for it.<p><p>Correspondents were also fascinated by the arctic aspect of the war. The snow, the cold climate and soldiers on skis wearing white camouflage formed novel and exotic experiences. This aspect is not far from what appeals foreigners in Finland today. Many correspondents chose to cover battles in Lapland, although the main struggle was fought on the Karelian Isthmus, in the southeastern part of Finland.<p><p>Correspondents weren’t sent to Finland immediately after the war broke out. Finland was expected to fall quickly, following the examples of Poland and Czechoslovakia. “The ensuing rush of war correspondents show a genuine interest in the turn of events” says Holmila.<p><p>All major publishing houses sent out correspondents, including thirty from Britain alone. The fact that the conflict took place in a time when news agencies had invested in wide networks of war correspondents but other fronts were rather quiet was an added reason for the attention.<p><p>Carrying what they can, evacuees from Karelia assemble at the railway station in Elisenvaara on March 18, 1940.© SA-Kuva<p><p>The war also engaged some war correspondents strongly on an emotional level. The most prominent example of this is John Langdon-Davies, the prolific British journalist most famous for founding the aid agency Plan International and for his coverage of the Spanish Civil War. “The title of his war memoirs, Finland: The First Total War, is quite telling,” says Holmila. It is also a welcome foreign input into Finnish history.<p><p>“Finnish history writing is limited by the fact that it is written by Finns. The language sets such strong barriers. What would have become of the history of Vichy, France if it had been left to Frenchmen to study?” asks Holmila. “Having foreign input has done the history of great powers a lot of good,” he goes on. Luckily some of Finnish history, such as the Winter War, can also be analysed through Russian and Soviet sources.<p><p>Seventy-five years on, the Winter War legacy is both close and distant. Most importantly it is complex and interconnected with broader history. The Winter War is yet an example of that war, regardless of outcome, has a colossal cost and long-lasting and often unexpected effects.<p><p>Rising above the national perspective<p><p>Heroic tale or trauma?<p><p>Appealing unity, exotic surroundings<p><p>Importance of foreign input<p><p>Holmila’s suggested introduction to Winter War literature<p>", "time": "2014-01-14T07:56:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

His passport is crammed with page after page of immigration control stamps, identical but for the date, acquired from petrol-purchasing border hops by car.<p><p>Orava is wearing a T-shirt and a pendant that are emblazoned with the patriotic Finnish lion symbol. Clutching a plastic mug of Karjala beer, he’s cruising on the M/S Carelia from Lappeenranta along the Saimaa Canal to the now Russian, once Finnish city of Vyborg (Viipuri in Finnish). His girlfriend Anne Kauranen will head straight for Vyborg’s market hall to stock up on cheap porcelain dolls.<p><p>Russian sailors line up in front of the Vyborg Castle, which dates back to the 1200s, getting ready for a parade.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Vyborg is located in the area of Karelia (Karjala in Finnish, hence the name of the beer) that was ceded to the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War and kept by Russia since the Soviet disintegration in spite of various Finnish attempts to negotiate its return.<p><p>It is regarded with misty-eyed nostalgia by many Finns whose families had to move across the new border when hostilities ceased. ”So sad,” says Anne, peering through the drizzle at the grey urban silhouette and describing the decrepit state of many of the once handsome buildings in what was a bustling and cosmopolitan harbour city.<p><p>Visa-free visits by ferry became possible in the spring of 2009 and have increased the number of Finns revisiting the city on summer canal cruises and promoted the canal to tourist attraction status. Options include same-day return and stays of one or two nights in Vyborg.<p><p>Travellers pass through a total of eight locks, chambers where the water level is raised or lowered to put the boats on the same elevation as the next segment of the canal.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>”I don’t think the canal would be built today, under present circumstances,” says Eero Metsä, the Carelia’s captain, as the boat sits in the Mälkiä lock. Three locks on the Finnish side and five on the Russian side of the border manage the gradual descent of nearly 80 metres between the Saimaa lake system and the Gulf of Finland.<p><p>This is the latest, 43-kilometre incarnation of the canal, completed in 1968, but remnants of the original route – a 28-lock ”Canal of Emperors” opened in 1956 – can still be seen along the way.<p><p>In Metsä’s view the expense involved in constructing the canal would be prohibitive in the present day. Finland recently signed a new lease deal costing an annual basic rent of 1.22 million euros – up from 300,000 euros – extending the previous lease period by 50 years.<p><p>Lake freight traffic from the expansive inland waterways of Saimaa, mainly carrying timber and forest products and reaching annual volumes of two million tonnes, has no other route to the Baltic and beyond. The canal also forms a popular summer passage for leisure boats. But the economic downturn has cut into traffic since the record peaks of 2001, when 100,000 people sailed through.<p><p>Time for contemplation: The boat sends waves swirling against the forested shore in Karelia, somewhere between Vyborg and Lappeenranta.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Apart from the M/S Carelia , the Dutch freighter Diamant is the only vessel plying the canal on a brisk day in September. Freight volume may be down, but the M/S Carelia and its tour operator, Saimaa Travel, do a healthy trade. Passengers are mainly from the Lappeenranta and Finnish Karelia area, not least because of the 7:40 am departure. The boat makes the trip to Vyborg and returns the same day, about six hours in each direction.<p><p>As well as the visa-free concession for cruise visitors, the recession has added to the appeal of the canal, since many Finns are looking for holiday options close to home.<p><p>”We have grandmothers taking their families to old Karelia and people shopping for linen and other cheap stuff in the Vyborg market,” says cruise manager Kirsi-Marja Jukonen. ”Some people have driven along the road that runs part of the way next to the canal and get the idea for a cruise from that. Some cruisers continue from Vyborg to St Petersburg by bus.”<p><p>On the return trip the following day, it’s Saturday night and the 150 passengers on board the Carelia are letting their hair down. An ample buffet dinner is followed by plentiful beer and Russian champagne. There are communal renditions of the ”Saimaa Waltz” and ”Do you remember Monrepos?” – the latter a reference to the park outside Vyborg, an icon of Finnish Karelian yearning.<p><p>Return Karelia to Finland?

{"title": "Medieval castles - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/medieval-castles/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In Finnish history, the prehistoric era is generally considered to end and the Middle Ages to begin in the 1150s, when, according to a Swedish chronicle, King Erik of Sweden and English-born Bishop Henry undertook a crusade to the southwestern parts of Finland. The chronicle’s claim that the Bishop ‘baptized’ the Finns has later been modified. Archaeological finds have shown that Christianity had reached the Finns as early as the eleventh century, and the main purpose of the crusade was thus to establish Swedish dominion in Finland and organize a bishopric there.<p><p>The first crusade was also part of much wider political and ecclesiastical perspective. Sweden was Roman-Catholic at the time. To the east of Finland lay the Novgorod republic, which was Greek-Orthodox. Finland was a country rich in natural resources in the middle and came to be seen as a desirable territory by both sides from about the twelfth century onwards. The Swedes arranged two more crusades, one in 1239, to Häme in central Finland, and another in 1293, to Karelia (Viborg) in the East. Meanwhile, the people of Novgorod made repeated raids into Finnish territory, burning the city of Turku in southwestern Finland as late as 1318. These conflicts did not end until 1323, with the peace treaty of Pähkinäsaari, which finally established that Finland was part of the kingdom of Sweden. The Swedes had to take up arms to defend the border numerous times during the Middle Ages and the 16th century, especially after the Muscovites took over Novgorod in the 1470s.<p><p>Thus the Swedes consolidated their power east of the Åland sea through three crusades. After each crusade, a castle was built to serve both defensive and administrative purposes. Turku Castle was built at the mouth of the Aura River in southwest Finland, by the city of Turku, the foremost town in Finland up to the beginning of the 19th century. Häme Castle in Häme was built after the second crusade. The third crusade led to the building of Viborg Castle, on an island in the Gulf of Finland off the coast of Karelia. These three castles became the centres of three provinces discernible as early as the Iron Age, called Finland, Häme and Karelia. The name ‘Finland’ only meant the settlements in the southwestern parts of the country as late as the early Middle Ages.<p><p>Turku Castle was probably founded in 1280.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Turku Castle was probably founded in 1280, i.e. at the very time when an old trading site on the Aura River developed into a town, the oldest, and for a long time the biggest, in Finland. Its name was Åbo in Swedish and Turku in Finnish; the latter derives from a Slavonic word meaning ‘market square’. The castle was built on an island in the estuary in the form of a rectangular fortified camp with four gates. The pattern was an ancient one, and can be traced back ultimately to the citadels built by the Romans in antiquity. In Turku, the idea was apparently that the camp should be possible to both fill and evacuate quickly, for instance prior to the third crusade in 1293.<p><p>The citadel had probably outlived its usefulness by the beginning of the 14th century, when three gates were walled shut and it was converted into a closed keep. Extensions were successively built using granite from nearby, and by the beginning of the 15th century, it had both a keep and a bailey. The keep, which had over forty rooms, was subject to a rigid hierarchy and only select guests were allowed entry to the ‘Royal Suite’ at the furthest end of the north wing; this consisted of a vaulted hall and an inner chamber. The king of the realm naturally resided in Stockholm most of the time, but the suite in Turku Castle still deserved its name, as no other castle in Finland was so often visited by the monarch. When the first king of the Vasa dynasty resided in Finland for eleven months in 1555-1556, the entire kingdom of Sweden was ruled from his hall in Turku Castle. The importance of the castle is also evident in the fact that it was subject to nine sieges before the end of the 16th century, mainly due to internal strife within the kingdom.<p><p>Häme Castle today.Photo: City of Hämeenlinna<p><p>Häme Castle (or Tavastehus in Swedish), the other great castle of the realm, was built in the very middle of the Häme wilderness and in the 17th century became surrounded by a town of the same name, Hämeenlinna. Work on building the castle seems to have started in the 1290s in connection with the organization of the three major ‘castle counties’ in Finland under bailiffs subject to the king in Stockholm. The fight against Novgorod was still going on when work started on Häme Castle. At the time, the castle thus formed part of a defense line against the east, although a short time later, after the peace treaty of 1323, it came to be rather far removed from the actual eastern border. It then became a center for the Swedish administration in the central parts of Finland.<p><p>Apart from the ground floor, Häme Castle is built entirely of brick, and therefore stands apart from the other castles in Finland, which were built in natural stone until the end of the 15th century. With its square ground plan and almost cubic mass, the castle is very similar to the castles built by the German orders in the Baltic countries and Eastern Prussia during the Middle Ages. The German influence is unmistakable and is likely to extend even to the choice of material, i.e. brick, which was manufactured on the spot by German craftsmen. The interior hierarchy of the rooms was organized so that all the finest rooms were on the first floor. The square castle ward had an external gallery at first-floor level, giving access to all the rooms through ornate brick portals. The gallery has been reconstructed and the portals restored.<p><p>The third major castle, Viborg, was built as the easternmost outpost of the kingdom of Sweden.<p><p>The third major castle, Viipuri (or Viborg in Swedish), was built as the easternmost outpost of the kingdom of Sweden. It was taken by the Russians in 1710, but was back in Finnish hands in 1812. Since the end of the war in 1944 it has again been on the Russian side of the border. During the Middle Ages it was repeatedly besieged by the Russians, most famously in 1495, under Ivan III of Moscow. The situation of the defenders looked hopeless, but they were saved by the ‘Viborg blast’, a mysterious explosion which scared off the Russians because they saw a St Andrew’s cross in the sky.<p><p>The three Finnish ‘castle counties’ were ruled from the castles of Turku, Häme and Viborg, respectively until the 1360s. In 1366, Albrecht of Mecklenburg was elected king, and according to the German model he began to divide up the castle counties into smaller provinces. In some cases, these new, smaller provinces were given separate bailiffs’ residences which have since disappeared; this was the case with the Borgbacken castle mound in Porvoo and Korsholm in Ostrobothnia, near the city of Vaasa which was founded later. Only earthworks remain at these sites, but in two places, stone strongholds were built which still exist, although in ruins. One is Raseborg in western Uusimaa (west of Helsinki), the other Kastelholm in the Åland islands.<p><p>Raseborg in western Uusimaa (west of Helsinki) was probably founded in 1374.Photo: Tero Pajukallio<p><p>We now know that Raseborg, which is a big, almost square granite ruin with a round corner tower, was probably founded in 1374. It was the seat of a bailiff who was an administrator for the western half of the south coast of Finland. A factor contributing to the decision to build such a big stronghold was that this was a more convenient place than Turku for handling the important trade with Reval (present-day Tallinn), on the other side of the Gulf of Finland. After Visby on Gotland had been taken by the Danish king, Valdemar Atterdag, in 1361, Reval became the major reloading port on the Hanseatic trading route from Lübeck to Novgorod. The bailiffs of the king’s castles in Finland had large volumes of tax paid in goods such as furs, timber, fish and butter, which were destined for the European market. In return, they received goods which had to be imported into Finland, notably salt, but also grain, spices, fabrics and wine. Raseborg was functional until the 1550s, when King Gustavus Vasa found it was completely outdated as a defense against contemporary firearms. Power and authority was therefore transferred from the castle to the newly founded towns of Tammisaari and Helsinki. Today, Raseborg is a rather spectacular ruin, well worth a visit.<p><p>Kastelholm in the Åland islands, where work probably began in 1384.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board/Jiang Ping<p><p>Kastelholm in the Åland islands, where work probably began in 1384, also had the double purpose of administration and defense. Åland was separated from the castle county of Turku and the Åland islanders were reluctantly subjected to a bailiff who ruled over them ‘at close quarters’. The defense function was more complicated, because it involved the defense of more than just the Åland islands themselves. A statement from 1525 describes Kastelholm as “a key to Sweden”, evidence of the importance attributed to Kastelholm as a last maritime outpost in the defense of Stockholm. Such a view was entirely justified in an era when the main thoroughfares were the navigation routes across the seas and through the archipelagos. Kastelholm lost its importance in the 17th century, but the castle still stands, partly ruined, but also with some intact interiors.<p><p>The five castles mentioned so far were all built before the advent of firearms. They were thus designed to withstand arrows, spears and siege engines, which were used to fire large rocks. This is evident in their outward appearance. The battlements on top of the castle walls were crucial; they were designed to ensure that no one could enter that way. The situation changed completely when firearms were introduced; the defenses then had to be concentrated in special, projecting towers fitted with gun loopholes. It also had to be possible to ensure that attackers could not breach the walls with their firepower. The first mention of firearms in Finland relates to Viborg castle, in 1429.<p><p>Olavinlinna Castle in Savonlinna.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>The first Finnish castle to be built for use in the era of firearms was Olavinlinna (Olofsborg in Swedish) in the wilderness of northern Karelia. The castle lies on an island in a system of lakes and inland waterways, and building work started in 1475 under the Swedes, mainly as a demarcation of the frontier. Novgorod had been taken by the Muscovites led by Grand Duke Ivan III and after he openly declared that he intended to invade Finland next, the Swedes wanted to demonstrate where the border lay in the uninhabited wilderness according to the peace treaty of 1323. The building process was dramatic, as the Russians felt that the castle was being built on the wrong side of the border and therefore did everything in their power to disrupt the work. The barges which brought sand, stone and lime to the building site were, for instance, attacked on numerous occasions. Research in our own time has proved the Russians right, as the castle was built about five kilometers into what was then Russian territory.<p><p>The castle, with its round projecting towers, clearly shows that it was built after firearms came into use. At the end of the 15th century, there was no master builder in Finland who was equal to such a task, and the governor, Erik Axelsson Tott, says in a letter dated 1477 that he had “16 good foreign master bricklayers” on the castle island. The building technique used would indicate that they came from Reval (Tallinn), where the town wall was extended in the same style at about the same period.<p><p>Olavinlinna was not built in vain. Ivan III put his threat into practice and the castle was besieged in both 1495 and 1496, but withstood the siege both times. More sieges followed during King Gustavus Vasa’s Russian campaign in 1555-1557, when the castle had a garrison of about 200 men.<p><p>Ruins of Kuusisto castle.Photo: Jouni Heikkinen/Vastavalo<p><p>All the castles mentioned so far were erected by the Swedish Crown in order both to defend Finland as part of the Kingdom, and to organize administration and taxation through the bailiffs. However, there was one more fairly big castle which played an important part in the history of the Finnish part of the kingdom of Sweden throughout the Middle Ages. This castle, called Kuusisto (or Kustö in Swedish), lay just southeast of Turku, where building work commissioned by the Bishop in Turku had started in 1317. This bishop was one of a total of seven in the kingdom of Sweden and his bishopric was the second largest, stretching all the way from Viborg in the east to Finnish Lapland in the north. Since the bishop was also a member of the council of the realm, he was not just an ecclesiastic but a political figure as well, and this was one reason why he needed a fortress: he also kept a private army. When the Muscovites besieged Viborg in 1495, Bishop Magnus III was able to contribute one hundred armed knights to its defense.<p><p>Kuusisto today is a ruin, because Gustavus Vasa ordered its destruction in 1528 as part of his battle against the Catholic Church after the Reformation. However, it is still possible to see that the castle comprised a keep and three baileys. There are the remains of gun towers, probably built in the 1480s, at the corners. Cannons were necessary to protect the Bishop in his stronghold.<p><p>Firearms gradually became increasingly powerful, and by the beginning of the 16th century, medieval castles were already quite outdated for defense purposes. Only the addition of earthworks could remedy this, and these were therefore built at, for instance, Turku and Hämeenlinna. But since the castles were solidly built, mostly of granite, new uses could still be found for them in the 16th century. This was particularly the case with Turku Castle, where the upper parts were rebuilt in the 1550s as what is now called the Renaissance Suite for Duke John, the son of King Gustavus Vasa, who later became King John III of Sweden. Gustavus Vasa was the king who introduced a hereditary monarchy into Sweden, and he therefore gave his four sons duchies where they could learn how to rule. As Duke of Finland, John lived at Turku Castle for seven years, during the last year with his wife, Polish princess Katarina Jagellonica, whose court, with its strong Italian influence, contributed to giving the Renaissance its first foothold in Finland. The fixtures of the Renaissance apartments were unfortunately destroyed in a fire in 1612.<p><p>As of the 17th century, the castles were only considered fit for less exalted tasks; they were turned into barracks, prisons, warehouses, distilleries and grain stores. But in one respect they remained unique; they were so solidly built of natural stone that it was not worth the effort to tear them down. They therefore remained as “phantoms of the past”, as one poet has it. In this, circumstances in Finland differed from those in countries such as Sweden or Denmark. In these countries, softer building materials such as sandstone or limestone had been available and bricks had been cheap. As a consequence, it was almost always possible to demolish outdated structures and replace them with new ones. Therefore, these countries no longer have any ancient granite castles of the type still found in Finland.<p><p>In more recent times, since the Second World War, some of Finland’s medieval castles have again been given a new lease of life. They have been rescued from degradation and restored, and have become the setting for new activities. Turku Castle, which was gradually extended over some three hundred years starting in about 1280 into one of the biggest castles in the Nordic countries, is one of the most popular historical attractions in Finland. Thanks to the fact that very little of the castle was ever demolished, the centuries are still there, as it were, layer upon layer, and a visit therefore represents a journey back through Finland’s entire history. Furthermore, the Renaissance Suite from the 1550s has discreetly been adapted for use as official reception rooms for the City of Turku, providing a suitably dignified setting for receptions held in honor of a number of heads of state and other dignitaries. Häme Castle has been restored on much the same principles, and also includes exhibitions halls used by the Finnish National Museum.<p><p>Among the restored castles, Olavinlinna in Savonlinna, north of the Saimaa waterways system, has built an international reputation for itself through the city’s opera festival. Every summer since 1969, professional opera of a very high standard has been performed in the bailey for four to five weeks. Although the castle has been restored according to strict contemporary principles for the restoration of historical monuments, it is nevertheless possible to erect a temporary stage and seating for an audience of some 2,000 in the bailey. The repertory has included many great classics such as Mozart’s Magic Flute and Wagner’s Flying Dutchman, and also contemporary Finnish operas, which have had a chance to establish a reputation thanks to the Savonlinna Festival.<p><p>In conclusion, it could be said that the medieval castles in Finland have always been treated with respect, and that this is one reason for their continued existence today. The situation is interesting, in that their history could also provide support for an opposite interpretation. But although there were times when the common people living around the castles cursed their rulers and bailiffs, the reputation of the castles still dominantly prompts awed fascination and a certain pride in these magnificent structures, which are such tangible proof of crucial episodes in the history of Finland.<p><p> <p><p>By Carl Jacob Gardberg, state archeologist, April 2002<p><p>Turku Castle<p><p>Häme Castle<p><p>Viipuri Castle<p><p>Raseborg Castle<p><p>Kastelholm Castle<p><p>Olavinlinna Castle<p><p>Kuusisto Castle<p><p>Use of castles from 1500 until today<p>", "time": "2009-09-23T07:39:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

We look inside this exclusive yet modest club just outside Helsinki.<p><p>The Finnish Sauna Society acts as the self-appointed steward of Finland’s cherished sauna culture, promoting all aspects of sauna heritage for Finns and foreigners. If Finland can be said to have an official sauna, then the society’s meticulously maintained sauna complex is it.<p><p>Located just west of Helsinki alongside a secluded bay on the island of Lauttasaari, the premises contain three traditional smoke saunas (more about these later), two more conventional saunas with wood-fired stoves and an electric “city sauna”. The building also houses an exhaustive collection of sauna-related literature, including research into the health benefits of saunas and details of technical innovations in sauna design.<p><p>To visit, you normally need a personal invitation from a member, but special sessions for small groups are sometimes arranged. “We wouldn’t like for foreign visitors interested in Finnish saunas to leave the country thinking that the hotel’s electric sauna was the real thing!” laughs Hilkka Heimonen, the society’s former executive director.<p><p>Around 3,800 people hold membership, but the Sauna Society remains quite exclusive, as newcomers have to be recommended by two long-term members.

As if to prove that sauna has Finnish roots, “sauna” is the only Finnish word widely borrowed by other languages. Today this country of 5.3 million boasts about two million saunas.<p><p>Heimonen describes a “real Finnish sauna” as a well-ventilated room with wooden walls, heated to 80–95 degrees Celsius by a wood-fired stove, with somewhere to wash nearby – and preferably a scenic lake in view. Optional extras include a bundle of leafy birch twigs, with which brave bathers slap against their skin to improve circulation.<p><p>The Sauna Society emphasises that saunas don’t endanger your health. “The fact that almost all Finns have saunas regularly should reassure people,” says Heimonen.<p><p>“You shouldn’t have a sauna if you have a cold or fever, and people with weak hearts shouldn’t go straight from a hot sauna into a cold lake, but recent research shows that saunas are actually beneficial for some heart problems,” Heimonen adds.<p><p>The perfect Finnish sauna experience includes a scenic waterside setting.Photo: Seppo Pukkila/Sauna Society<p><p>“Saunas used to be at the centre of every aspect of people’s lives in Finland,” says Heimonen. “For earlier generations they were the only place to wash. They were also used to smoke fish and meat, wash clothes, and dry linen.” Life used to begin and end with a sauna: It was the cleanest place for women to give birth, and the bodies of the deceased were also washed there.<p><p>“Today people see saunas as a place to relax, both physically and mentally,” Heimonen says.<p><p>Almost everyone in Finland has access to a sauna. In rural areas most homes still have saunas with wood-fired stoves. Apartment blocks typically have electric saunas where families have their own scheduled hours. Neighbours get a chance to gossip at weekly communal male or female saunas. Being together in the altogether can encourage otherwise reticent souls to expose their innermost selves as well as their naked exteriors.<p><p>Heimonen notes that in spite of their doubtful reputation in some of the world’s seedier cities, saunas have no sexual connotation in Finland. Finns of all ages fail to see why so many people immediately associate saunas or simple nudity with sex.<p><p>Why does the Sauna Society maintain so many saunas? People like different temperatures. The hottest reaches an infernal 130 degrees Celsius.<p><p>Afterwards I chill out with a dip in the cool waters of the tree-fringed bay and a drink in the society’s café-lounge. It’s hard to believe that this peaceful place lies just a few miles outside Helsinki.<p><p>For many purists, the only true sauna is a smoke sauna, deep-heated for several hours using sooty smoke. Before use, it must then be ventilated and cleaned to ensure that no one is smothered by fumes or smeared with soot. Everyone in Finland seems to agree that smoke saunas have softer and somehow more soothing vapours.<p><p>Smoke saunas, preferred by many purists, are hard to maintain and almost disappeared in the late 1900s, but now they’re all the rage again.Photo: Seppo Pukkila/Sauna Society<p><p>The Sauna Society’s official sauna stoker, Seppo Pukkila, has just stripped off when I meet him, as he’s gasping for a sauna himself, having just finished the arduous task of preparing all the saunas for the two o’clock opening time.<p><p>In the middle of his endeavours, one of the sauna walls had almost burst into flame. Luckily he noticed a tell-tale wisp of smoke and could hose down the smouldering log joint in time. “The joints of the wooden buildings that house smoke saunas can easily combust spontaneously as the vapours rush through tiny cracks, so you have to keep a very close eye on them,” he explains.<p><p>Mainly because they are so laborious to heat, smoke saunas almost disappeared towards the end of the 20th century, but now they are all the rage again.

However, we believe that Sweat still provides insight into the competition, which can be considered an extreme sport and bears little resemblance to the everyday sauna experience that forms a cherished part of the Finnish culture.

{"title": "Maritime culture thrives in Kotka - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/maritime-culture-thrives-in-kotka/", "review": "", "content": "<p>First a man with a passion discovered a rare wooden boat. Now the beautifully restored vessel forms the centre of attention in Kotka’s old harbour area.<p><p>The story begins in 1930s England, where renowned naval architect Charles E. Nicholson designed and built a 12mR-class racing boat on commission from Bermudan Marion “Betty” Carstairs (1900–93). This large yacht, more than 21 metres long, was eventually christened the Blue Marlin. Between 1958 and 1987, 12mR was the standard class for yachts competing in the world’s best-known sailing race, the America’s Cup.<p><p>Carstairs, who lived a colourful life filled with fast boats and automobiles, did not take possession of the boat she had ordered. Instead it ended up in the Mediterranean, in the ownership of an Italian family.<p><p>The boat aged and began to fall into disrepair, eventually sitting disused in a harbour for several years. A Finnish banker, sailor and wooden boat aficionado, Henrik Andersin, found and bought the vessel, which was carefully transported from Slovenia to Finland in 2006. He began to investigate options for restoring a boat the size of the Blue Marlin.<p><p>Revitalising cultural life in Kotka’s harbour: The Finnish Wooden Boat Centre is at the centre of the action.Photo: Leo Skogström<p><p>The port city of Kotka, on the Gulf of Finland about 130 kilometres east of Helsinki, boasts a lively boatbuilding tradition and numerous master craftsmen. However, the cooperative running the Kotka Wooden Boat Centre was becoming less active. Andersin bought its property in the old harbour area.<p><p>The building was not big enough for the Blue Marlin restoration project, so Andersin commissioned a new structure for the site from Lahdelma &amp; Mahlamäki Architects. A boatyard purpose-built for making and restoring wooden boats was inaugurated in May 2008. Its impressive curved-roof design is reminiscent of a boat’s hull and its all-glass front and back walls reflect the expanses of the sky and sea.<p><p>In its new home, the Blue Marlin is being restored to its original 1938 condition. Most of the interior, which had survived the decades in good condition, has now been removed and carefully preserved for future use. Virtually all of the rest of the boat is being meticulously rebuilt according to the original plans. The work will take an estimated three years in total. Andersin aims for the reborn Blue Marlin to take part in a 12mR race tentatively scheduled to happen in Helsinki in 2011 – with eyes on a prize, of course.<p><p>Andersin has a broader vision as well. The Finnish Wooden Boat Centre works to preserve and advance wooden boat culture while offering the public a chance to explore it. The main building welcomes visitors with exhibition and meeting space as well as a café. The structure of the boatyard affords the public a close-up view of the Blue Marlin restoration and other boatbuilding work. Altogether the centre is home to three wooden boatyards and three other nautical firms as well as storage places for boats. The centre hosts training sessions, as well as concerts and other cultural events. Visiting boats can dock overnight at the guest marina.<p><p>In May 2009, the Finnish Wooden Boat Centre received a building and environmental award from the Arts Council of Southeastern Finland, for its work in nurturing the wooden boat tradition and in revitalising cultural life in Kotka’s harbour and city centre.<p><p>Located on the same street as the Finnish Wooden Boat Centre and designed by the same architects, the Maritime Centre Vellamo forms a multifaceted museum and information centre that celebrates maritime culture.<p><p>The wave-shaped Maritime Centre Vellamo and its exhibitions will catch your eye and capture your imagination.Photo: Maritime Centre Vellamo<p><p>The building is stunning, both inside and out. Its exterior is made up of sheet metal cassettes painted in various shades and silk-screened fibreglass, which is illuminated at night. Seen from the sea, it shimmers like the horizon at sunset. Once inside the unusual, wave-shaped building, a visitor can step into a different world, a different time, and easily lose his or her sense of direction – as is often the case at a good museum.<p><p>The Maritime Centre Vellamo includes the Maritime Museum of Finland, the Museum of Kymenlaakso, the Coast Guard Museum, boat exhibitions, an information centre and a restaurant. The exhibitions focus on the relationship of the Gulf of Finland’s coastal residents to the sea: sailing, boatbuilding, trade, fishing and other aspects of maritime culture, including traditional celebrations and pastimes at sea and in port.<p><p>The museums are designed to offer experiences. Visitors can taste the atmosphere of ship galleys through the decades, tie knots or carry out underwater surveillance. The shows also captivate children’s imagination. <p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, July 2009<p><p>Old boat moves into new home<p><p>Nurturing wooden boat heritage<p><p>Coastal living through the ages<p>", "time": "2014-04-08T09:00:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

The change is dramatic. Mother Nature, who so recently lay dormant and frozen under a blanket of snow, bursts into wild blossom as summer arrives.<p><p>The onset of summer is also reflected in people. They can finally cast off their heavy winter clothes. Shoulders long hunched together against icy winds can finally relax; steps become lighter and faces brighter. The Finns make the most of their summer.<p><p>The awakening of nature in the north is an impressive show: tens of thousands of migratory birds arrive from southerly countries to nest, trees fill with leaves almost overnight and everything is abuzz with life. Unlike countries where the hot sun beats down for many months in a row and dries vegetation to a crisp, Finland usually remains green all summer.<p><p>In the cities, the silence of the summer streets often surprises visitors. It is particularly quiet from Midsummer in late June until early August. That’s when most Finns enjoy their four to six weeks of summer holiday in the peace of the countryside, preferably by a lake or seashore. Recharging batteries in the sun and near water is a prerequisite for surviving the long, dark winter.<p><p>A shot on a Finnish dream. A traditional summer cottage and sauna on a lakeshore.© Finnish Tourist Board/Keijo Penttinen<p><p>Where do the Finns spend their summer holidays, then? At summer cottages, of course! There are half a million summer homes in Finland, or roughly one for every five households. Many are shared by extended families, while others rent cabins or stay with friends.<p><p>A vacation home offers a place to relax, enjoy nature and sports, and spend time with loved ones – to stare at the calm water, savour the aromas of the forest, think deep thoughts and live a simpler life. Most Finns like their summer paradises to be as quiet as possible and as far from neighbours as possible.<p><p>Nearly everyone has a sauna, usually heated in the evening. There you can bathe at your leisure, cooling off intermittently on the porch or in the water. For many, this is a great joy: the world quiets down, mind and body are at peace and all is well.<p><p>Bonfires are lit across Finland on Midsummer Eve.© Finnish Tourist Board/Matti Kolho<p><p>The high point of the summer is the Midsummer holiday, around the summer solstice. While not the warmest time, this is when the sun is at its highest and shines the longest. In most of the country, the sun does not set at all, or just drops briefly below the horizon before rising again in the wee hours.<p><p>The Finns celebrate Midsummer with gatherings out in the countryside or at sea. Flags fly around the clock, saunas are heated up, houses are decorated with aromatic birch branches and large bonfires are lit on the shoreline. The accordion plays poignant tunes as couples dance late into the night.<p><p>Around Midsummer, the first harvests of the year appear at markets and shops: new potatoes and strawberries.<p><p>The northern sun makes strawberries redder, sweeter and more aromatic than further south. And nothing beats fresh local potatoes, which seem to melt in your mouth.<p><p>Summer meals are typically built around new potatoes. The tiny, tender tubers are steamed or boiled with dill and served piping hot with butter alongside pickled herring, fresh fish or grilled meat and a salad. For dessert, strawberries are served alone or with sugar and cream or ice cream – what a treat!<p><p>While landlubbers head for their cottages, seafarers cruise to the beautiful archipelago.© Finnish Tourist Board/Pekka Luukkola<p><p>Summer is the time to relish the water, whether swimming, boating or fishing.<p><p>Finnish children learn to swim early and family members compete as to who is the first to “throw off their winter fur” by making that first dive into the lake or sea. Those who do so before Midsummer are a hardy bunch, as the water temperature rarely reaches 20 degrees Celsius in June.<p><p>There are plenty of opportunities to enjoy the water, as Finland boasts nearly 190,000 lakes, 180,000 islands and a mainland shoreline of more than 6,000 kilometres. One in three Finnish families owns some kind of boat – at least a rowboat that can be used to set nets for pike and perch.<p><p>Pori Jazz is one of the crown jewels of the Finnish summer festivals.© Finnish Tourist Board/Matti Kolho<p><p>When summer comes, culture and art also move out to the countryside. July in particular is the time for the great summer festivals, with Savonlinna Opera, Pori Jazz and Kuhmo Chamber Music among the most internationally renowned events. Also on offer are visual art, theatre, rock concerts, literary gatherings, traditional celebrations, religious gatherings and village events around the country – something in every municipality.<p><p>The season culminates with the Helsinki Festival in late August and early September. Tourists and Helsinkians returning from holidays to the capital are treated to a wide array of international orchestras, circuses, theatre and dance performances and much more. In late August, as the nights get darker yet remain warm, the whole city celebrates the Night of the Arts, with a myriad of events spilling into the streets until dawn.<p><p>Crayfish parties are all about getting together, a few schnapps, toasts and singing.© Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>The northern harvest begins to ripen in late July. Many families spend vacation days picking and conserving wild raspberries, blueberries, lingonberries and cloudberries. After the late summer rains come forest mushrooms – boletes, chanterelles and dozens of other edible species.<p><p>The king of the late summer culinary season is the crayfish, which can be caught starting on July 21. Families, groups of friends and companies arrange light-hearted crayfish parties, centred around impressive piles of the glowing-red crustaceans. Digging the flesh out of the small shells is a somewhat complicated and messy ritual, but this exotic delight rewards the effort. The crayfish are washed down with cold schnapps and songs.<p><p>May we propose a toast: To the joys of summer in Finland! <p><p>By Salla Korpela, updated July 2010<p><p>Into the wild<p><p>Summer cabins, shoreline saunas<p><p>Daylight at night<p><p>Summer treats<p><p>Onto the water<p><p>Summer celebrations<p><p>Harvest time<p>", "time": "2013-06-06T11:07:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Defensive victory led the way to peace - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/defensive-victory-led-the-way-to-peace/", "review": "", "content": "<p>On June 6, 2004, the whole world — tout le monde, as the French would say — watched entranced as the landing of American and British soldiers on the shores of Normandy amidst a hail of German bullets was relived on TV.<p><p>Presidents Bush, Chirac and Putin and Prime Minister Blair joined in celebrating that heroic opening of a huge effort that culminated 11 months later in the defeat of Germany — or the liberation of Germany, as Chancellor Schröder put it.<p><p>But where was the Red Army? After all, Stalin had promised President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill that the Soviet Union would mount a massed attack immediately after the Normandy landings. Three days later, on June 9, the Red Army did launch an attack, but not towards Berlin; instead, it was aimed at Viipuri through a sector 15 km wide on the western shore of the Karelian Isthmus.<p><p>This operation was no sideshow. The artillery bombardment, the prelude to the main offensive, was so massive that it was heard all the way to Helsinki. There were 300 to 400 artillery pieces per kilometre of front line in the attack sector, and the vanguard of the attack force outnumbered the Finnish front-line forces on the Karelian Isthmus by two to one. Over 600 tanks were mobilized, and air support was provided by some 1,000 aircraft.<p><p>This offensive was an unexpected devastating blow that punched a hole in the Isthmus front and caused widespread panic. Even though intelligence on the appearance of new Soviet divisions and artillery and armoured units on the Isthmus had trickled through to Army Headquarters in Mikkeli, the Finnish High Command failed to conclude that this was in preparation for an attack on Finland. The received wisdom was that the Soviet troops were bivouacked, recuperating in preparation for a massive push towards Germany. It was thus, as Mannerheim put it, “Strange, to say the least, that the Russians should attack us”.<p><p>In the West, the outlook was much the same. Defeating and occupying Germany was an objective that took precedence over all others. It was considered self-evident that as the Allies advanced towards Germany, the countries occupied by the Germans would be liberated. That was, after all, what the war was all about.<p><p>The Soviet command — or shall we say Stalin — had a different conception. While bringing Germany to its knees was of course Stalin’s main objective too, he was also determined to ensure that his neighbours allied with or occupied by Germany would come under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, constituting a ‘buffer zone’. Once the Red Army had expelled German forces from the Baltic States, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, these countries could be brought under Soviet control on the sly. Finland, however, did not lie on the direct route to Berlin. It was on the sidelines, and beyond it lay a neutral state, Sweden.<p><p>Finland considered itself a case apart from all other countries at war. We considered that we were fighting a separate war against the Soviet Union, a war justified by Finland being the victim of aggression in the Winter War of 1939-40. The morally acceptable purpose of the Continuation War, which began in 1941, was to seek retribution for the wrongs that Finland had suffered. This separate war was to lead to a separate peace which would restore the territories that Finland had lost in the Winter War.<p><p>A separate peace with Finland was discussed at the summit meeting of the three major powers in Teheran on December 1, 1943. Roosevelt spoke in favour of Finland, and so did Churchill, even though Britain had declared war on Finland in December 1941. Stalin admitted that “a people that had fought so valiantly for its independence deserves consideration”. He presented his terms for peace: restoration of the borders of the 1940 treaty; annexing Petsamo to the Soviet Union; a “50 per cent restitution” for the damage caused by the Finns; the expulsion of Germans from Finland; and demobilization of the army. Roosevelt and Churchill did not comment. For them, the important thing was for Finland to remain an independent and democratic society.<p><p>Finland’s political leadership had realized as early as the winter of 1942-43, around the time of the Battle of Stalingrad, that Germany would lose the war and that Finland would have to get out of it as soon as possible. The Government headed by Edwin Linkomies was dubbed the ‘peace cabinet’. National Romantic aspirations of annexing Eastern Karelia and its Finnic peoples to Finland were quietly dropped. Paasikivi conveniently forgot the radio speech he had written in October 1941 where, quoting Dostoevsky, he surmised that Leningrad, the “window on Europe” opened by Tsar Peter the Great, would close as the Germans occupied it and that Russia’s political focus would shift towards the east and south, further from Europe. And no one brought up the fact that, in July 1941, Mannerheim had sworn that his sword would never be sheathed until Viena and Aunus (as the Northern and the Southern part of Russion Carelia were respectively called in Finnish) were free…<p><p>But when Paasikivi returned from Moscow with Molotov’s peace terms in March 1944, the Government and the majority of Parliament were aghast. The terms were considered draconian. However, the true reason for this was never spoken aloud. It was feared that Germany would punish Finland as it had only recently punished Hungary. German forces still held the whole of continental Europe. There were 200,000 German alpine troops in northern Finland, and the south side of the Gulf of Finland was under German control. The Germans could easily have “driven a wedge between the supporters of the Government’s peace policy and the people who vehemently opposed it”, wrote Linkomies in his memoirs Vaikea aika (A difficult time).<p><p>But Paasikivi’s position, whereby Finland should accept the Soviet terms despite their severity, found support among the opposition in Parliament. It became a political watershed used after the war to divide politicians into supporters of the ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ foreign policy.<p><p>Instead of German punishment, Finland met with Soviet punishment. What was the true objective of the Red Army offensive? Was it to occupy Finland or merely lend weight to Molotov’s terms? The answer was to depend on the outcome of the campaign.<p><p>The defence forces on the Isthmus recovered from the unexpected crushing blow. No more than one week after the beginning of the attack, Mannerheim exclaimed with relief: “The Finns are fighting again!” Most of the soldiers who had fled in panic were sent back to the front (although 46 court-martialled deserters were executed, and 11 were shot without trial). On June 16, transfer of troops from Eastern Karelia to the Isthmus front was begun. The defences were strengthened, but the attack did not yet grind to a halt, and on June 20 Soviet forces captured Viipuri.<p><p>As the battle escalated, the political climate was heating up too. It is difficult for us in the age of the Internet to understand the morass of unclear and conflicting messages and rumours in which the ministers and generals and their aides became embroiled.<p><p>Suddenly, on June 22, the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arrived in Helsinki, uninvited and unannounced, to demand that Finland commit itself unequivocally to Germany’s side. On the very next day, a message from Moscow came via Stockholm — a demand for surrender!<p><p>Finnish troops under fire cross a road in Ihantala.Photo: SA-kuva<p><p>Finland was now caught in a vice between two superpowers. Surrender, it was feared, would lead to Soviet occupation, while commitment to Germany to the bitter end would spell utter disaster. Now panic broke loose in political circles.<p><p>President Risto Ryti and Finance Minister Väinö Tanner tended towards surrender, while Mannerheim and Prime Minister Linkomies considered Germany’s military aid essential in repelling the Red Army offensive. The Government was split, although the majority of MPs favoured surrender. The only solution was for the President to take a personal stand. This was executed as a brilliant diversion.<p><p>Ryti sent a letter to Hitler, stating that he committed himself to continuing the war on Germany’s side to the very end. What he did not tell Hitler was that he would resign as soon as the situation demanded, at which point Finland’s commitment to Germany would be rendered null and void.<p><p>Hitler swallowed the bluff, considering the word of Finland’s “leader” a sufficient guarantee. So did the U.S. Government, who expelled the Finnish ambassador. So did the Swedes, who declared that Finland was now irrevocably doomed. So did the peace-favouring opposition in Finland — Paasikivi, Kekkonen, Wuori and Fagerholm — who began to set up a refugee government in Stockholm.<p><p>Stalin, however, appears to have called the bluff. This is the only explanation for why the Soviet ambassador in Stockholm, Madame Kollontay, sent the would-be refugee government back home, informing them that the Soviet Union would be talking terms of peace with the Finnish Government.<p><p>The political leaders of Finland, like many other leaders over the centuries, had taken a page from Machiavelli:<p><p>“…it did not appear he should avoid any procedure in order to save the country, for as the life of Rome depended on the life of that army, it appeared to him it should be saved in whatever way, and that the country is well defended in whatever way it is defended, either with ignominy or with glory; for by saving that army, Rome would in time wipe out that ignominy; but by not saving it, even though they should die most gloriously, Rome and its liberty would be lost.”<p><p>Ryti sacrificed himself in taking upon himself the “ignominy” to which the Western world considered Finland had stooped in relying on Hitler’s Germany to halt the Soviet offensive.<p><p>It has afterwards been observed that the bulk of the German aid had already been received before the Ribbentrop agreement. Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck anti-tank weapons had been ferried from Germany in April, Battle Unit Kuhlmey with its 70 aircraft had begun its campaign on June 17, and the first units of a German infantry division were on their way to Finland through Estonia before Ryti ever sent his letter to Hitler.<p><p>This division is considered to have played a major part in the defensive engagements at the Bay of Viipuri in July, while the assault gun brigade sent by the Germans had a negligible effect. The most spectacular contribution was made by the Stuka dive-bombers of Battle Unit Kuhlmey. In the battle of Tali-Ihantala, for instance, the German aircraft accounted for 63% of the bombs dropped on Soviet positions. Kuhlmey also shot down 151 Soviet aircraft. If no agreement with Germany had been entered into, Battle Unit Kuhlmey would probably have been withdrawn from Finland, and the infantry division would also have been recalled.<p><p>However, calling on Germany for help must be understood in a wider context. At Midsummer 1944, no one could possibly have known when and how the Soviet offensive might be halted. Continued help from Germany was considered vital. And continued it was; between the end of June and the beginning of September, Germany supplied Finland with a total of 28,860 tonnes of materiel, more than in any previous war year apart from the very beginning of the Continuation War.<p><p>But regardless of the quantity or nature of this military aid, what really decided Finland’s fate was Hitler’s great gamble, which shook the whole of Europe. In August-September 1939, Hitler turned his back on the east, and as a consequence the Soviet Union attacked Finland with intent to occupy; twelve months later, Hitler began to prepare his assault on the Soviet Union, and as a consequence Finland sought to regain the territories lost in the Winter War. At that point, “the whole world” believed that Germany would occupy the Soviet Union in a matter of months. If only we had known…<p><p>Once the tables had been turned and the Soviet forces had the upper hand, no amount of German help could ever have saved Finland had not the patriotic fighting spirit of our forces continued to grow from strength to strength, notwithstanding the artillery bombardments, air raids and infantry and armour assaults of the Red Army, which surpassed anything previously seen. As the attention of the rest of Europe was focused on the advance of the Western Allies from the French coast to Germany, Finland’s struggle to remain independent went largely unnoticed, even in our neighbouring Sweden. The only thing that was remembered was that Finland had been on the wrong side. Finland was labelled as having fought “a losing war”.<p><p>When Prime Minister Göran Persson of Sweden visited Finland in summer 2002, his opposite number Paavo Lipponen took him to the Hämeenlinna Artillery Museum to watch a video on the battle of Tali-Ihantala. The half-hour documentary made a deep impression on Persson. He said on leaving the museum that only now did he realize what Sweden owed Finland.<p><p>In the background, a Russian KV2 assault vehicle destroyed by Finnish anti-tank fire (foreground) at a crossroads between Ihantala and Karisalmi.Photo: SA-kuva<p><p>In addition to the defensive victory gained at Tali-Ihantala, the front line held fast at Kivisilta and Tienhaara to the north of the Bay of Viipuri and at Vuosalmi on the shores of the Vuoksi River. Further defensive victories were achieved at the Bay of Viipuri and on the northeast side of Lake Ladoga, and in Ilomantsi the Soviet contingent was besieged.<p><p>On July 12, the Soviet troops received an order to stop advancing and dig in. Soon Finnish scouts noticed trains with empty trucks advancing towards Viipuri to take troops away from the Finnish front. They were needed for the great push towards Berlin.<p><p>The defensive victory achieved by the Finnish Defence Forces showed once again that when a superpower, with its manifold objectives and commitments, is faced with a small nation fighting for its survival, the odds cannot be assessed simply on a one-on-one basis. For the second time in five years, Finland had succeeded in putting up such resistance that the price of occupying the country would have been so high as to damage other, more important interests of the Soviet Union; in 1940, continuing the war against Finland could have drawn the Soviet Union into a world war from which it had decided to abstain; and in summer 1944, the Soviet divisions in Finland were getting sidetracked from the decisive battles in the main theatre of war.<p><p>The ignominy of the alliance with Germany was expunged when Ryti resigned and Field Marshal Mannerheim was elected President on August 5. At that moment, the Army was still capable of defence, numbering 528,000 men. There were not enough Soviet forces on the Finnish front for a renewed assault. The Marshal-cum-President could calmly wait for the right moment to sue for peace. Daily he inspected intelligence reports on troop movements to the south of the Gulf of Finland to make sure that Germany would no longer be capable of retaliatory action against Finland.<p><p>Mannerheim’s initiative was patiently awaited in Moscow. Obviously Stalin trusted the Marshal; more than six months earlier, he had declared to the Swedish Foreign Minister that Mannerheim would not be touched.<p><p>A Russian tank in position in front of a burned-out rural post office (background).Photo: SA-kuva<p><p>Meanwhile, negotiations on the terms of peace to be presented to Finland were still going on in Moscow. On July 21, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov proposed to Stalin that the Finnish border be pushed back west, so as to bring the Kaukopää mills belonging to Enso in Imatra and the Kaukas mills in Lauritsala to the Soviet side. This would have resulted in an extra refugee population of 250,000. Voroshilov further proposed that the Soviet Union should establish military bases in both Porkkala and Hanko and that Soviet troops should occupy Helsinki, Åland, Turku, Vaasa, Oulu and Tornio until the war against Germany was over. He proposed the sum of 800 million dollars in war reparations. Stalin, however, dismissed Voroshilov’s proposals.<p><p>No one in Finland knew anything about this, of course; it was not until the Soviet Union collapsed that Russian archives have become available to scholars.<p><p>The archives have yielded a more extensive version than previously known of the draft treaty presented by Molotov to Paasikivi in March 1944. It contained several demands that Paasikivi was never informed of, for instance the ceding of several naval bases to the Soviet Union and the ‘rectification’ of the border of 1940 so that the Saimaa Canal, the upper reaches of the Vuoksi River and the shore of Lake Saimaa would come under Soviet control. But Stalin ignored this too.<p><p>Finally, on August 24, Mannerheim sent Hitler a letter declaring that Finland was withdrawing from the war. Germany is such a mighty nation, Mannerheim wrote, that it shall live on even if it loses the war. Finland, however, is such a small nation that it could be evicted from its dwelling place and destroyed.<p><p>He could well have quoted J.V. Snellman, who wrote: “Only uncivilized tribes have been observed to fight unto their very destruction.” This, indeed, is what Hitler did.<p><p>Hostilities at the front ended on September 5, and negotiations on the truce agreement began. The terms of peace presented to the Finnish delegation included the ones that Stalin had presented to Roosevelt and Churchill in Teheran: the 1940 border, the annexation of Petsamo, the expulsion of German troops and demobilization. But there was a further condition that had not been mentioned in Teheran, the leasing of the Porkkala naval base to the Soviet Union.<p><p>“Why was Finland never occupied?” asked Yugoslavian dictator Tito in April 1945. Stalin replied, “We took the Americans much too much into account.” Finland was, of course, not the only issue whose treatment by the Russians was influenced by Soviet relations with the United States. Stalin respected the wishes of the Americans because the Soviet Union was dependent on the military and economic support it received from the USA.<p><p>Stalin’s personal relations with Roosevelt were very close at the time. The American President treated the Communist Soviet dictator with remarkable tolerance. The bloodthirsty tyrant morphed into good old Uncle Joe. Relations between the two countries took a turn for the worse after Roosevelt’s death; his successor Harry Truman was suspicious of the Bolshevik leader.<p><p>“This war is not like earlier wars,” Stalin said to Tito. “Any power that occupies a land brings its own political system there too. Everyone will extend their political influence as far as their armies can go.” In the direction of Finland the Red Army could go as far as the 1940 border, but no further. In 1974, Molotov said in an interview: “We were wise not to annexe Finland. It would have been a running sore… The people there are stubborn, very stubborn.”<p><p>Actually, we were more than flexible. When the focus of power was in Berlin, we turned a blind eye to Nazi atrocities. When Moscow gained supremacy, we ignored Stalin’s brutality. We did everything we could to appease our mighty neighbour. No one even mentioned a ‘defensive victory’. (The very concept did not appear until 1956, in a book published by General Oesch.) The official position was that we had lost the war. Ryti, Linkomies, Tanner, Ramsay and many others were condemned as war criminals and put in prison, while Paasikivi, Kekkonen, Fagerholm, Wuori and others formed a Government. Of the people in charge during the Continuation War, only Mannerheim remained untouched, just as Stalin had promised. The Communist Party was made legal, and Soviet society and its workings became a topic that was taboo.<p><p>As the world war continued, more destructively and fiercely than ever, Finland disappeared below the news horizon. Scarcely anyone noticed that Finland became the first wartime combatant to hold a free post-war election, in March 1945. The next such election was held in Britain, in June. Although the Communists were on the ballot for the first time in 16 years, the results of the election showed that the basic structure of Finland’s political system had remained stable.<p><p>Of the countries that ended up in the Soviet sphere of influence at the end of the Second World War, Czechoslovakia was the only one with a tradition of democracy. It was in a wholly different position from Finland, though. In the election held in Czechoslovakia in 1946, the Communists gained 40% of the vote, and they had a strong grip on the civil service and the army. The Czechs were, for historical reasons, positively inclined towards the Soviets; after all, the Soviet Union was the only one of the Allies that had declared in 1938 that it would defend Czechoslovakia against Germany. The Communists were internally so strong that they managed to stage a coup in 1948 without the intervention of the Red Army. In the same year, the Communists were excluded from the Government in Finland.<p><p>Amidst the upheaval in Europe, Finland was largely ignored. When I met the well-known British writer and columnist Harold Nicholson in Paris at the peace conference in autumn 1946, he asked me in terms of deepest sympathy, “Which occupation was worse for you — the German or the Russian?” A more significant question was posed by President John F. Kennedy in autumn 1961 as he prepared to receive President Kekkonen in Washington, “What most interests us Americans is to know why the Soviet Union allowed Finland to remain independent.”<p><p>The answer was simple — a defensive victory! More broadly, Finland’s independence was preserved due to historical reasons, namely its geopolitical location and its position in the sphere of Western democracy.<p><p>In retrospect, the Continuation War was indeed a separate war that ended in a separate peace. We never did recover the territories we had lost in the Winter War; the Soviet Union dictated the permanence of the situation that prevailed at the end of the Winter War. But the Continuation War did not lead to the loss of our independence. Apart from Britain, Finland emerged as the only European country that participated in the war but was never occupied. We preserved our democracy, even though its flame burned low now and again. The fighting spirit of the Finns was a convincing display of national unity and vigour.<p><p>This article by writer and diplomatist Max Jakobson was translated from the Finnish original, which appeared in the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on September 3, 2004.<p><p>By Max Jakobson, September 2004<p><p>Finland’s separate position<p><p>Trapped between two superpowers<p><p>Hitler’s gamble<p><p>Defensive victories<p><p>The way to peace<p><p>The war lost<p><p>Defence of independence<p>", "time": "2009-06-16T08:47:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Japan: Big in Helsinki - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/japan-big-in-helsinki/", "review": "", "content": "<p>From a mutual love of design to a fondness for karaoke and sushi, the Japanese and Finns share a surprising number of passions.<p><p>Tucked away in Helsinki’s posh Ullanlinna neighbourhood is a tiny boutique called Lisn, which specialises in high-quality Japanese incense. It is the only store outside of Japan to sell the Lisn product line of Shoyeido, a traditional and respected incense maker with 300 years of history.<p><p>Stepping over the threshold is like taking a trip: In lieu of a welcome mat, a flat round stone separates the noisy bustle of the outside world from the oasis of calm found inside the shop. Here, Japanese and Finnish design meet in the minimalist interior, created by well-known Finnish designer Vertti Kivi. (His surname means “stone,” which seems a fitting touch of symbolism.)<p><p>“Lisn started as a personal passion,” says Finnish co-owner Sami Hilvo, who is fluent in Japanese. Hilvo and Brazilian-born partner Paulo Silva both worked in Tokyo for many years.<p><p>“When we decided to move to Finland, which is well known for its contemporary design, we thought it would be a good idea to combine a passion and a business opportunity,” says Silva.<p><p><p><p>With 120 different types of incense available, Lisn’s concept is based on the idea that different scents can be used to set different moods ranging from “fresh” to “chic” and “luxurious.” For example, under the category of “natural,” the suggested incense menu is as follows: morning might start off with bergamot, continue with sandalwood in the afternoon, follow with lavender in the evening, and round off with camomile and mint for night.<p><p>Lisn Helsinki’s Paulo Silva and Sami Hilvo.Photo: Katja Pantzar<p><p>According to Hilvo and Silva, Lisn’s customers are men and women of all ages with one thing in common: “They have an interest in bringing something new and enjoyable to their lifestyles while sharing precious moments with friends, or having a personal moment of calm and quietness.”<p><p>In Japanese, the verb “to hear” is used instead of “to smell” when breathing in a fine fragrance. The name Lisn comes from the sound of the English word “listen.”<p><p>The duo recently started working with Hotel GLO, Helsinki’s first lifestyle hotel. Scented Lisn bags complement the amenity boxes of each room. A junior suite in the hotel features a Room of All Senses, for which Lisn provided the scents and audiovisuals, with a piece called “Meeting in the Forest” that was developed together with a Kyoto-based group called Rewall.<p><p><p><p>In addition to the products available at Lisn, Helsinki serves up Japanese culture in other forms. Next door to Hotel GLO is the five-star Hotel Kämp, which turned their popular international brasserie into a high-end Japanese restaurant – complete with a chef from Japan.<p><p>Like Lisn, Yume provides a sensual experience. It fuses Japanese and Scandinavian culinary traditions into a menu built around the four seasons. As the seasons change, so do the menu, the wine list, the décor, the flower arrangements and even the restaurant’s website.<p><p>Yume fuses together Japanese and Scandinavian culinary traditions.© Palace Kämp<p><p>Karaoke, a form of entertainment in which amateurs sing along to recorded background music with lyrics displayed on a television monitor, is a Japanese tradition popular with Finns. A karaoke machine can be found in just about every bar and private coach throughout the country.<p><p>It should come as no surprise then, that Finland holds the Guinness World record for the largest number of people singing karaoke at one time: 80,000 people gathered together in Helsinki and sang “Hard Rock Hallelujah,” in May 2006 following Finland’s win of the Eurovision Song Contest by monster rockers Lordi. Further testament to the Finns’ love for this Japanese invention is the Karaoke World Championships, which originated in Finland. This event has grown from a small contest involving seven countries to an annual competition with 30 countries participating.<p><p><p><p>“The backbone for all things Japanese being so popular could be summed up by one word: consistency,” responds Silva, when asked why the Finns are such fans of all things Japanese.<p><p>“Japanese culture, which pays attention to form and detail, has become one of the best products that Japan has to export. It has refined various skills into art forms such as the traditional martial art disciplines of judo and karate, the art of the tea ceremony (chadô), flower arranging (ikebana) and incense (kôdô). More recently the appearance of Japan’s contemporary art forms has been remarkably visible: design, fashion and pop-culture.”<p><p>“The marriage between beauty and function is obvious in the design traditions of both Finland and Japan,” says Hilvo. “Something that has been born out of necessity is respectful to its function, clean and calm not only to the eye, but to the soul. Perhaps this also applies to other aspects of life and how we relate to them.”<p><p>And as Finns are drawn to Japanese design and culture, the Japanese are interested in Finland.<p><p>Not far from Lisn is Kahvila Suomi (“Café Finland”) on Pursimiehenkatu in the Punavuori neighbourhood. The café was the main filming location for last year’s Kamome Diner, the story of a Japanese woman who moves to Helsinki. The film achieved such cult status in Japan that a surge in tourism from Japan to Finland was reported by the main Finnish daily newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat.<p><p>Although a shared love of function and aesthetics are among the reasons that Japanese visit Finland, Silva offers another point of view: “The biggest difference between contemporary Japanese and Finnish life is time. Finland and Helsinki still have a feeling of calm and quietness in the lifestyle when compared to Japan’s major cities, such as Tokyo. The growing number of Japanese visitors to Finland may be after exactly this: the calm. I’ve understood that the fast-moving and busy lifestyle of Japan is quite a new thing; the Japanese long for the feeling of calm of yesteryear that they can only find here.”<p><p>Top Finnish designers including COMPANY (Aamu Song &amp; Johan Olin), Harri Koskinen, Ilkka Suppanen, Lustwear, Naoto Niidome, Pentagon Design and Syrup Helsinki are working on designing products for the Lisn concept. The results will be displayed in three exhibitions in three cities: Helsinki, Kyoto and Tokyo. The Helsinki exhibition will be held at Lisn Helsinki in September. The Tokyo exhibition will be held at the Axis Gallery, which is in the Axis complex, one of the most important design centres in Japan.<p><p>The Japanese and the Finnish share a love of raw fish, and the popularity of Asian cuisine has grown here in recent years. Owned and operated by Yoshio Tamura, Gyosai-Sushi Bar (Runeberginkatu 40B/+358 9 241 3440) is officially the city’s smallest restaurant, with five seats, while Norisushi Bar in the Old Market Hall (Eteläranta 1/+358 9 260 0027) makes great sushi in slightly more spacious environs. Nearby, upscale Raku-ya (Eteläranta 4/+358 9 675 449) features a sushi bar in front and a traditional Japanese restaurant in back, complete with private dining booths made of rice paper. At sushi bar Ichiban (Mikonkatu 8/+358 9 672 345/www.ichiban.fi), tucked away on the second floor, you can get a full meal deal with sushi, miso soup, and tea for about ten euros. Ichiban has a second location on the ground floor of the Kamppi shopping centre. When Japan’s Prince and Princess Hitachi visited town, the Japanese embassy ordered dinner from Kabuki (Lapinlahdenkatu 12/+358 9 694 9446), run by Yoshiaki Takayama, and known as a place where local celebs host parties and considered by many to be one of the city’s best sushi spots.<p><p>For karaoke Finnish-style, try Helsinki’s Pataässä (Mariankatu 9/+358 9 626 076) favoured by locals and domestic pop stars alike: Finnish chart-topper Paula Koivuniemi has been known to take over the mike here. A special bonus, all-day and night karaoke on Saturdays and Sundays starting at 9 am. Another Finnish specialty is the Karaoke Taxi (www.karaoketaxi.fi/+358 40 500 6070), which seats up to 12 people and is kitted out with all the karaoke essentials.<p><p> <p><p>By Katja Pantzar, June 2007<p><p>Good sense<p><p>Turning Japanese<p><p>Cultural forms<p><p>Designing products for Lisn’s lifestyle concept line<p><p>Sami and Paulo’s Japanese Helsinki picks<p><p>Sushi time<p><p>Karaoke time<p>", "time": "2009-06-04T06:49:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Unveiling Finland's mediaeval secrets - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/unveiling-finlands-mediaeval-secrets/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The vaults of the Finnish National Library house one of the world’s largest collections of mediaeval manuscript fragments, totalling more than 10,000 parchment leaves. A research project was launched in spring 2007 to explore this treasure.<p><p>Most of the fragments are from manuscripts written and used in Finland during the Middle Ages. As was customary then, they were written on parchment, which is made from animal skins. These fragments form by far the largest body of mediaeval literature preserved in Finland. Whereas only a few dozen complete mediaeval codices are known to have survived, it is estimated that the parchment fragments at the National Library represent as many as 1,700 different manuscripts.<p><p>Thematically the material is very diverse. Most of the fragments come from mediaeval religious texts, but there are numerous other fragments dealing with, for example, legal matters or philosophy. The beautifully gilded initial letters and endearingly wobbly handwriting open a door to the mediaeval world.<p><p> <p><p>Why has the material survived only as individual parchment leaves? The answer is that after the Reformation that took place during the reign of King Gustav Vasa (1523-1560), king of Sweden and Finland, Catholic religious literature became redundant. Mediaeval manuscript books were broken up into single leaves and, in an early example of recycling, used again as cover wrappings for the taxation scrolls of the King’s bailiffs.<p><p>Cataloguing the fragment collection of the National Library was begun in the 1920s and is still going on. But although this collection is a treasure trove of information on the Middle Ages in Finland, it is so extensive and so complex that very little use has been made of it in scientific research.<p><p> <p><p>A beautiful initial letter R in a missal of the 13th or 14th century.Photo: National Library of Finland<p><p>We know surprisingly little about Finland’s literary culture during the Middle Ages, even though it was the literature written in Latin and Swedish which linked Finland firmly to the Western cultural sphere and left a legacy whose influence is still evident today.<p><p>A research project launched in spring 2007 endeavours to shed some light on the emergence, development and impact of this earliest form of Finnish literature. The three-year project is led by Tuomas Heikkilä (a lecturer at the University of Helsinki) and financed by the Emil Aaltonen Foundation. Support has also been given by the Academy of Finland and the National Library.<p><p>This project is the first to explore all of the surviving Finnish mediaeval manuscripts and fragments. The collection of the National Library constitutes the majority of this corpus and thus has special status in the project.<p><p>The aim of the project team is to create for the first time a comprehensive overview of writing and literature in the mediaeval Diocese of Turku, whose domain broadly coincides with modern Finland. This will help clarify previously unanswered crucial questions, such as: What did people write and read in mediaeval Finland? What were the writers’ influences, and how did texts find their readers? How did the cultural identity of Finland come to be linked with western Europe and the Latin part of Christendom in the Middle Ages?<p><p>A page of liturgical text from a lectionary of the 14th century used in the diocese of Turku.Photo: National Library of Finland<p><p>The project is not only nationally significant but of international interest too. The spread of social and cultural values in mediaeval Europe and the emergence of a common European identity is one of the hottest issues in international mediaeval research. The spread of established Latin literature to the newly founded Diocese of Turku, where no indigenous pagan written culture existed, is highly relevant from a general European point of view.<p><p>The project team will study the manuscript material using methods drawing on the disciplines of history, philology, textual research, paleography, codicology and information processing science. Not only will this diverse approach generate new information on the earliest roots and development of written Finnish culture, it will also create a new, solid foundation for future research and, finally, put Finland firmly on the map of mediaeval text studies in Europe.<p><p>The National Library’s parchment fragment collection constitutes the earliest layer of literary culture in Finland. It can without exaggeration be dubbed Finland’s oldest national treasure.<p><p>The existing fragments have survived the soiled hands of their mediaeval readers, reuse by bailiffs of the 16th and 17th centuries, several fires, and arduous journeys from Finland to Sweden and back. Even though parchment is a very durable material, many of the National Library’s fragments are now quite fragile from heavy use and recycling, and are faded, torn and scorched. In the Middle Ages, the useful life span of a parchment manuscript was generally estimated at 300 years, but these fragments are now up to three times older.<p><p>Digitizing the collection would make the fragments accessible to both scholars and the general public without endangering the originals and without the difficulty and great care required in handling them. Careful professional cleaning and conservation of the fragments would improve their readability and durability.<p><p> <p><p>Tuomas Heikkilä is a lecturer at the University of Helsinki and leader of this research project.<p><p>By Tuomas Heikkilä, November 2007<p><p>Why only individual leaves?<p><p>Pioneering research project<p><p>Overview of writing and literature<p><p>Treasure in danger?<p>", "time": "2009-05-25T07:38:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Undeterred, our reporter shares his views on the subject.<p><p>Finland is a conservative country. At least, this conventional wisdom is echoed in countless guidebooks and newspaper articles. But in many instances, Finns refuse to act as you would expect conservative people to behave.<p><p>Their use of language, whether their own language or a foreign one, is a case in point.<p><p>Look up Finnish profanity on Wikipedia and it will tell you that in Finland ‘it is commonly considered impolite to swear excessively…and particularly in front of children’. This generally holds true.<p><p><p><p>However, a large slice of Finnish youth seems overly familiar with the less polite zones of their language, mostly expletives describing various parts of the human anatomy. These words have a way of popping up in public situations: on buses, on trains and in shops. And they leave the mouths of boys and girls alike.<p><p>Profanity is part and parcel of language usage, of course, as any linguist can tell you, but shouldn’t it be saved for special occasions? Some Finns now claim that the V-word (if you don’t know what the really bad words are in Finnish, we’re not going to repeat them here) has been said so often that it’s lost its shock value.<p><p>Don’t get me wrong. I must point out that most Finnish kids are not programmed to utter expletives. But the polite, soft-spoken ones are often overshadowed by the minority that go to extremes.<p><p><p><p>Leaving aside the juvenile talent for forming whole sentences comprised of anatomy-related obscenities, a fair amount of strong Finnish language is unrelated to the body and its functions. We don’t suggest that you add it to your vocabulary, but the old standby perkele refers to the Devil and derives from the pre-Christian word for the god of thunder.<p><p>Finland’s Swedish neighbours refer to “management by perkele”, a reference to the supposedly direct approach of Finnish bosses to dealing with workplace situations and the frequent use of the word to punctuate their orders. This makes Finnish offices sound much scarier than they really are, but it’s part of Finland’s myth in many Swedish eyes.<p><p><p><p>Visitors to Finland may notice the casual use of English profanities – although this particular phenomenon seems to be audible in most countries nowadays, no matter what language the locals speak. The Finnish proficiency in English is admirable, but it does not need to extend to the liberal use of our F-word (“our” referring here to English speakers).<p><p>It’s our F-word, after all. The Finns wouldn’t like it if we used their equivalent with the same lack of sensitivity.<p><p>Things would be much simpler if the words of popular travel writer Bill Bryson were true. Infamously, in one of those gaffes that Finns will never forget, he states in his book Mother Tongue that “some cultures don’t swear at all… The Finns, lacking the sort of words you need to describe your feelings when you stub your toe getting up to answer a phone at 2:00 am, rather oddly adopted the word ‘ravintolassa’.”<p><p>This perfectly polite word simply means “in the restaurant”. It makes you wonder who was pulling Bill’s leg.<p><p> <p><p>Finnish cartoonist Milla Paloniemi has made swearing into an art form with a comic strip entitled The Cursing Hedgehog.

Since neither is spoken by many people outside the Nordic countries, the Finns are aware of the need to learn other peoples’ languages. Today, it is no exaggeration to say that virtually every Finn up to middle age at least can communicate in a foreign tongue, most often English.<p><p>So, visitors to Finland are not expected to speak Finnish or Swedish. Indeed the locals would be surprised if they did. That’s fine for foreign adults working temporarily in Finland, advancing their careers, but what if they have school-aged children with them? Where can they go to school?<p><p>If Helsinki, the capital, is their destination they would have a wide choice of schools where the language of teaching is not Finnish or Swedish. For teaching in English at all age-levels there are the International School of Helsinki and the English School. In addition, a number of other schools that offer instruction in English at the upper secondary level, enable pupils to study, for example, for the International Baccalaureate (IB) examination, the Advanced International Certificate of Education or (at the English School) the American Advanced Placement program.<p><p>The Deutsche Schule Helsinki has a good reputation for academic achievement. It employs German as the language of instruction and students take the Reifeprüfung as their matriculation examination.<p><p>French is quite well served, bearing in mind that contacts between Finland and France have never been really extensive. That is despite the oft-cited exceptions of Olavus Magni, the Finnish clergyman who was rector of the Sorbonne briefly in the 15th century, and the community of fin-de-siècle Finnish painters who honed their skills in Paris, Brittany and Normandy. The Lycée franco-finlandais d’Helsinki covers the same syllabus as the equivalent Finnish grades. The upper classes accept students from abroad if there is room and the applicants can demonstrate adequate proficiency in French and Finnish in aptitude tests.<p><p>The Ecole francaise Jules Verne consists of a preschool and grades 1 to 9 and the language of instruction is French.

It is also home to the Tikkurila International School which was founded in 1992. As the school’s website explains, “The original purpose of the school was to offer an English language alternative school to parents who had worked or planned to work or study abroad. Later, because of increased demand, the school also accepted children whose parents wanted an alternative to traditional education in the elementary school.<p><p>Turku is a fascinating, photogenic town in SW Finland. It is Finland’s former capital and the country’s oldest seat of learning. The first Finnish university was founded there in 1640. Given this distinguished history as a centre of education, it was appropriate that the Turku International School opened in August 2003. It was founded by the City of Turku. Under an agreement between the City and the University of Turku teaching in the international school will be taken care of by Turun normaalikoulu, which is Turku’s teacher training school. The official language of the international school in English. In its own words, “The school is intended for foreign-born children living temporarily or permanently in the Turku region, Finnish children returning to Finland after residing abroad and Finnish children competent enough to receive education in English.”<p><p>A number of other schools in Turku have classes that teach subjects in English at the secondary and upper secondary levels but these lessons are designed principally for local children, speakers of Finnish and, or, Swedish.<p><p>Are there any other international schools outside the Helsinki and Turku districts? Indeed there are. Virtual Finland took a sample of three other important Finnish towns, Tampere, Jyväskylä and Oulu, all regional centres, and found that all of them do offer schooling in languages other than Finland’s two official ones. But the level and extent of instruction they provide vary.<p><p>For the offspring of internationally mobile parents, Oulu offers education in English in the International School which implements the IBO Primary Years Programme (PYP) for grades 1-4 and Middle Years Programme (MYP) for grades 5-9. The IB Diploma programme can be studied in the upper secondary school Oulun Lyseo. The city also offers immersion classes in Finnish for immigrants to ease their integration into Finnish school life.<p><p>Tampere has the International School of Tampere, founded in 1990. It was established in response to the difficulty of attracting foreign researchers and other academic staff because the town could not provide instruction for their children in English.

Finns are no exception.<p><p>The Finnish language in general is regarded as difficult and Finnish names have an exotic ring to them. For example, you introduce yourself to a Finnish woman and it sounds like she responds, “I know.” She might not be saying that she is aware of who you are, but that her name is Aino. Perfectly normal.<p><p>Understandably, Mr Aimo Sori (pronounced “I’m oh sorry”) also had a hard time getting his name across initially. But most problems occur with long names including the letters å, ä and ö. Therefore names such as Äkäslompolo or Yrjönen often raise eyebrows and give rise to verbal acrobatics. However, your new Finnish friend will appreciate your effort. At worst, you’ll have a laugh together.<p><p>When being introduced, a follow-up question in many countries is about the meaning of your name. Let’s present some well-known Finns and explain what their names mean.<p><p><p><p>It seems as if some people were destined for their vocation the moment they were christened. Weather forecaster and television profile Pekka Pouta is one. To the regret of many Finns and tourists alike, he all too seldom forecasts the type of weather associated with his last name, which means “sunshine”. That of course, is not his fault, but an occupational hazard of working in Finland.<p><p>Mika Ihamuotila, the Chairman of leading Finnish clothing and textile design company Marimekko, has been dubbed Mr Marimekko by Finnish media. Probably a name and a title to his liking, but his surname already contains the word “muoti”, which means “fashion” in Finnish. He used to be a banker, but perhaps he was driven by his fateful name to buy a controlling interest in Finland’s famous fashion house.<p><p><p><p>Most Finns were proud, and with good reason too, when former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. Interestingly, in contrast to his nonbelligerent nature, Ahtisaari’s first name actually means warlike. It can be traced back to the Latin name Martinus, which in turn is linked to Mars, the god of war.<p><p>What about Ahtisaari’s surname? “Ahti” is the sea god in the Finnish national epic Kalevala, and “saari” is Finnish for “island”. So the name of the current Nobel Peace Prize holder can actually be loosely translated as “Warlike, from the island of the sea god”. A patriotic Finn could try to excuse this juxtaposition between character and name by noting that Ahtisaari’s grandparents were Norwegian and changed their surname from Adolfsen to Ahtisaari in 1929.<p><p>Nicknames can describe a person’s career or maybe even character. Finnish Formula One star Mika Häkkinen is called “Häkä”, a diminutive of his surname which also happens to mean carbon monoxide, a waste gas produced by engines. His compatriot Kimi Räikkönen, however, is called “Räkä.” Räka means “snot” and might refer to his childish looks and unapologetic behaviour.<p><p>Trying to pronounce Finnish names just adds to their charm. But sometimes even a Finn is left wondering if there might be a hidden meaning behind all those ä’s and ö’s. <p><p>By Jens Alderin, April 2009, updated July 2015<p><p>Nomen est omen<p><p>The kindest man and the fastest man<p>", "time": "2009-04-22T14:43:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Let’s open the door and step inside.<p><p>Here we go!<p><p>It’s a few minutes past eight and the dim October morning has not yet given way to daylight when the pupils of Strömberg Lower Comprehensive School (ages 7–13) start taking off their jackets, caps and shoes in front of their coat-racks. An inviting fire, lit by the school caretaker to cheer the pupils up, is crackling in the fireplace in the hall.<p><p>Hellos are shouted along the corridors as pupils, teachers and the rest of the school staff greet each other. In this school, everybody knows each other, and the pupils call their teachers by their first names, as is customary in Finland.<p><p>Each child finds his or her own group. The classes are named after animals that live in Finnish forests: Elks, Bears, Foxes, Lynx, Hawks, Weasels, Seals, Eagle Owls and Wolves. And there are the Beavers, a class of pupils with mental disabilities; these kids arrive by taxi each morning. The school day can begin.<p><p><p><p>At the Strömberg School, as at most Finnish schools, kids spend recess playing outside, no matter what the weather.Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>Strömberg Lower Comprehensive School in Pitäjänmäki, a suburb of Helsinki, is located in the middle of an old industrial estate that has recently been filled with new blocks of flats. Situated near busy thoroughfares in the western part of Helsinki, some ten kilometres from the centre, Pitäjänmäki encompasses a wide social spectrum, from high-income homeowners to low-income families living in city-owned rental houses. A fair number of immigrants live in the area.<p><p>The school itself is a City of Helsinki comprehensive school, drawing pupils from homes in the neighbourhood. It is located in a former machine engineering workshop that was converted and extended for use as a school in 2000. The school principal, Päivi Ristolainen, took part in planning both the school curriculum and the building, her expertise helping ensure that they serve the modern concept of good learning.<p><p>In typical Nordic architectural style, the premises are light and spacious, the materials durable and the colours warm. Apart from ordinary classrooms, the school has workshops for magazine-making, handicrafts, music, drama, science and environmental education; and a gym and a library. The school’s specialities include a small winter garden, corners with sofas for reading, and chess tables for games.<p><p><p><p>Back to the classrooms: some of the groups are being taught in their own home classrooms. For these lessons, which include Finnish, mathematics and more, the pupils determine weekly targets with their teachers and choose tasks to be carried out at their own pace.<p><p>Some groups are taking their turn in the workshops, learning through practical training. For instance, each group regularly spends time in the magazine workshop, working on their own publication.<p><p>The lessons are by no means spent in silent memorization; the children walk around, gather information, ask advice from their teacher, cooperate with other pupils and occasionally even rest on the sofa. The classroom situation is active, but the teacher never lets go of the reins – and doesn’t have to resort to authoritarian methods.<p><p><p><p>Students at the Strömberg School take turns taking care of the pet tortoise, Pertsa.Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>Each lesson lasts 90 minutes. The pupils usually spend the thirty-minute recess outside playing in the schoolyard, regardless of the weather. They use the sports field for football in the summer and skating in the winter.<p><p>The school follows the pedagogical principles of the Frenchman Célestin Freinet, who underlines learning by doing and community orientation. Mrs Ristolainen-Husu points out that both the Finnish national core curriculum and the Helsinki city curriculum comply with Freinet’s ideas, but Strömberg School takes the model one step further.<p><p>This also means that the school has age-group–integrated classes, so that each group has children of two different ages. In such groups, differences between the children are taken for granted and less comparison results.<p><p><p><p>Learning by carrying out “chores” is a key element in the school’s curriculum. This means that pupils participate in common chores from the first year onwards. Taking turns in groups, they see to the school’s houseplants, library, wastepaper collection, recycling, compost, yard and aquarium. They help in the kitchen and the Beaver classroom and care for the environmental workshop’s pet tortoise Pertsa.<p><p>Non-teaching staff guide the kids in these chores: cleaners, kitchen workers, the caretaker, the school secretary and attendants. Everyone shares responsibility for educating the children and unnecessary hierarchy is avoided among the staff.<p><p>The school is also open to the local community. Parents are always welcome in the classrooms and their expertise is utilised in the workshops and evening school sessions. The classes go on a lot of excursions.<p><p>Each year the school has a special theme for all pupils; it is discussed from interdisciplinary and artistic viewpoints. The themes rotate from year to year: water, earth, air and fire.<p><p><p><p>Pupils and teachers eat lunch together in a cosy lunch room.Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>It’s time for a break after all that studying. And we’re hungry, too!<p><p>Like all Finnish schools, Strömberg School serves a free hot meal every day. Today it’s meatballs and mashed potatoes, a favourite with generations of children, served with salad, bread and milk. Special portions have been reserved for children with different dietary requirements for health or religious reasons. The children eat at cosy tables with tablecloths and flowers in vases throughout the year.<p><p>No extra funds above the average school construction budget were spent in building or maintaining Strömberg School. Yet a lot of ideas have been implemented here that people come from all over Finland and the world to learn about. Architects, too, come from all over the world to see the school building designed by Kari Järvinen and Merja Nieminen.<p><p><p><p>The school day is over between 12 noon and 2 pm, depending on the day and group. Nearly all the children come from families where both parents work fulltime, as is customary in Finland, and the little schoolchildren find the afternoon alone at home too long. Consequently, city authorities have built a playground near the school, with access safe from motor traffic.<p><p>Artistic viewpoints also form part of the school day.Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>The playground offers the schoolchildren an extensive recreational area with playground and games equipment and two buildings where first- and second-grade children can do their homework or play indoor games. Playground attendants take care of the children, who are also provided with a snack at cost in the afternoon. Otherwise the entire playground facility is free of charge.<p><p>After four o’clock in the afternoon, the playground gate opens and shuts repeatedly as parents arrive to pick up their children. The knees of the children’s trousers are dirty and their gloves are damp; they’ve done and seen a lot. They’ve played hard and a fun time has been had by all.<p><p>The school also arranges a low-cost snack and free afternoon clubs and hobby groups for students in the upper grades. This year they are studying Japanese, learning to play in a band and doing arts and crafts.<p><p>On with your rucksacks and wave to the attendants – see you tomorrow! <p><p>By Salla Korpela, updated March 2011<p><p>Light, space and social spectrum<p><p>Active lessons<p><p>Learning by doing<p><p>Windows on the world<p><p>Lunchtime!<p><p>Fun for everyone<p>", "time": "2011-03-29T10:43:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

For the results gathered in 2009 and published in 2010, a total of 6,415 students from 203 schools took part in Finland.<p><p>In that PISA study, special attention was paid to reading literacy. In this subject Finnish 15-year-olds came out second among the 33 participating OECD countries, after South Korea by a margin of only three points (Korea 539, Finland 536). Finland was third among all 65 PISA countries, with Shanghai-China placing first.<p><p>Finland scored well in the secondary portions of PISA 2009 as well: mathematical literacy and science literacy. In mathematics, the Finns placed second among OECD nations and sixth among all 65 participants, while in science they scored first among OECD countries and second overall.<p><p><p><p>According to the survey, the strength of the Finnish school system is that it guarantees equal learning opportunities, regardless of social background. Instead of comparison between pupils, the focus is on supporting and guiding pupils with special needs. Very few children need to be made to repeat a year.<p><p>The teaching staff in Finnish schools is highly educated. Qualifications for all school levels require a Master of Arts degree including extensive pedagogical study and qualifications in special subjects.<p><p>Small children’s feelings of safety and motivation are increased by the fact that they are taught by a single teacher. Also, although students receive progress evaluations, scaled grading is not introduced until the fifth year. Finnish schools aim for natural, warm relations between teachers and pupils.<p><p>Finland’s repeated success in the PISA study has focused widespread international attention on the country’s school system and its support for lifelong learning.<p><p><p><p>Comprehensive school education is provided by the child’s home municipality, and the network of primary-level schools is dense. Instruction and all basic education materials are free of charge for the children, and services include a free hot lunch every day, school healthcare and free transport for children who live too far from the school to walk or use public transport.<p><p>Preschool instruction is provided for six-year-olds. This is voluntary, but almost the entire age group participates.<p><p>Instruction is provided in both official languages, Finnish and Swedish. In major cities schooling is available in other languages as well. Special schools exist for disabled or hospitalised children. Practically every Finnish child goes to school.<p><p><p><p>A group of students celebrates after graduating from upper secondary school.Photo: Erja Raiskila<p><p>Approximately 50 percent of each age group continues to upper secondary schools. The curriculum covers a great many optional subjects and takes an average of three years, concluding with the national matriculation exam. Matriculation provides a foundation for continuing studies.<p><p>Apart from upper secondary schools, a three-year basic vocational education alternative also exists. This line of study is chosen by nearly all those who do not continue to upper secondary schools – only 7 percent of young people choose not to continue studying. Those who obtain a further vocational qualification can continue their studies in polytechnics or other institutions of higher education.<p><p><p><p>Higher education is divided between polytechnics and universities. Polytechnics provide education and training aimed at high-level professional skills to meet the requirements of working life, while universities carry out scientific research and provide conventional academic instruction.<p><p>Depending on the institution in question, student selection is based on examination certificates or a combination of certificates and entrance examinations. Finland’s national strategy aims to provide a polytechnic or university degree to 42 percent of young adults by the year 2020.<p><p>In Finland, school education stretches over a long period of time; a significant number of higher education students do not graduate before the age of 25. The goal is lifelong learning; plenty of further training opportunities are supported by the public sector for adults who are already employed.<p><p>All school levels are free of charge for the pupils. The government has provided funds for various social benefits for students relating to means of support, meals, housing and healthcare. Educational institutions are predominantly owned by the local or central government.<p><p>Thanks to its comprehensive, high-quality public-sector school system, Finland has no commercial training and education market in basic education. At other levels and in other sectors, commercial provision is also relatively small compared with many other Western countries.<p><p><p><p>Classes number about 30 pupils per age group, usually less in the younger classes. For the first six years of comprehensive school, the children are instructed by a class teacher. Instruction during the last three years of comprehensive school is taken over by subject teachers. Pupils are also given special instruction if needed for speech impediments and for reading and writing problems or similar special needs.<p><p>Comprehensive school subjects include native language and literature; other languages; environmental studies; civics; religion or ethics; history; social studies; mathematics; physics; chemistry; biology; geography; physical education; music; art; handicrafts and home economics. The goals of instruction and the core curriculum are the same nationwide, but the local authorities and schools draw up their own local curricula on that basis.<p><p><p><p>Finnish schools emphasize foreign language studies. The first foreign language is generally introduced in the third year of comprehensive school and the second domestic language (Swedish for Finnish-speaking pupils and Finnish for Swedish speakers) in the seventh year, if not sooner.<p><p>In addition, pupils may opt for up to six different languages by the completion of upper secondary level. The most common foreign languages are English, German, French, Russian and Spanish.<p><p>Immigrants with native languages other than Finnish or Swedish receive special instruction in Finnish as a second language. Municipally funded instruction in the children’s native language is provided twice a week.<p><p><p><p>Most Finns are members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church, and their children participate in instruction in that religion. Members of other religious groups are also entitled to instruction in their own religion if a minimum of three pupils form a study group.<p><p>Those who are not members of a religious group are exempted from instruction in religion. Instead, they study ethics, interpersonal skills and religions throughout their school career.<p><p><p><p>Many municipalities have upper comprehensive and upper secondary level schools with weighted curricula focusing on subjects such as music, art or sports.<p><p>Teachers’ high education level allows them to plan their work and choose their methods independently.

Overrun with tourists in winter and sleepy in summer, the shop’s narrow aisles always had shelves piled high with everything you’d expect to find in a general store – and then some.<p><p>“A few years ago, we started to notice how we were running out of space,” says 30-something Sampo Kaulanen, the third generation of store managers since the original Jouni opened a small shop in the basement of his home in 1950. Back then, the story goes, there were less than a dozen homes in the village. Now, at the height of ski season, the population swells from 400 to more than 20,000.<p><p><p><p>Jounin Kauppa has also expanded, into a 5,894-square-metre hypermarket complete with café, liquor store and beauty salon. Where the old shop stood, visitors are now confronted with a shiny new strip of businesses, names illuminating the winter darkness.<p><p>Sampo Kaulanen researched and commissioned a unique, sustainable combination of energy sources for his 5,894-square-metre store in Finnish Lapland.Photo: Carey Toane<p><p>But it’s what you can’t see that makes it remarkable: Jounin Kauppa is the first and only store in Finland with a heating and cooling system that runs entirely on clean, renewable energy. If you’ve ever been to Lapland in the wintertime, you’ll realise that energy accounts for a large part of the cost of operating a business.<p><p>“With an architect we were planning how to expand the old shop, but it was impossible because the old building was just so small, and the parking lot too,” says Kaulanen. “So we started to think of a completely new building, and that’s when I got the idea that it should be as high-tech as possible. And it was also that I just like doing things a little differently.”<p><p><p><p>Kaulanen studied various heating and cooling systems and ended up with the only building of its kind in the country, using a combination of geothermal energy for heating and lighting and carbon dioxide for cooling refrigerators and freezers. All power sources are managed via one fully integrated system.<p><p>During peak times, additional energy is pumped from 15 heat wells drilled into the rock beneath the shop, which also power air conditioning. During off-peak times, surplus energy is stored for later use. This keeps the condensate heat from the cold equipment at a low level and minimises the amount of additional energy that has to be bought from the grid.<p><p>The total renovation cost 13.5 million euros, which Kaulanen anticipates will be recouped soon. After that, the next stage is a combination of solar and wind energy to remove the last dependence on fossil fuels, making the building self-sufficient and 100 percent emission free. “This is what I can do for more sustainable development, to help change things. Second, this is an investment that’ll pay for itself in the long run, though it’s quite a bit more expensive to build.”<p><p>What do the locals think of this latest claim to fame for Äkäslompolo? “I don’t know,” says Kaulanen. “I guess they’re kind of amazed.”<p><p>By Carey Toane, March 2009, updated January 2014<p><p>Illuminating the darkness<p><p>Pays its own way<p><p>Link<p>", "time": "2014-01-23T10:22:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Finland's weather and light - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/finlands-weather-and-light/", "review": "", "content": "<p> <p><p>In Finland the weather can vary greatly during one day, first sunshine, then rain. Rapid changes in the weather are a characteristic feature from one day to the next. In the winter troughs of low pressure that have formed over the North Atlantic bring mild, cloudy and wet weather on southerly and southwesterly winds. The hottest weather in the summer, on the other hand, generally comes from the southeast, bringing thunderstorms and heavy rain showers.<p><p>As far as tourism in Finland is concerned, the weather both in summer and winter has its own exotic attraction. Autumn and spring are short and the weather in those seasons has its own beautiful features reflected by the natural surroundings. The striking tints on the leaves in Lapland in September are particularly splendid. The rich colours of the autumn last a week or two, their timing varying from year to year. Leaves obtain their colourful tints after a few nights of frost. Once these colours fade away in the north, they reappear quickly in southern Lapland. Elsewhere in Finland the period of autumn foliage occurs during September and October. In March and April the spring snow in Lapland glistens under the plentiful sunlight, a magnificent time for a winter holiday.<p><p>View of Helsinki South Harbour in summer. Photo: Finnish Tourist Board.<p><p>The same view in winter. Photo: FTB/Karsten Bidstrup<p><p> <p><p>Because of our northern location and because nights are light from the end of May to the beginning of August there is daylight in summertime around the clock across the whole of Finland. Lapland, north of the Arctic Circle, has “nightless nights” in the middle of the summer, when the sun does not sink beneath the horizon at all. This period starts at the end of May and continues to mid-July. In the far north of Lapland the nightless nights last from May 17 to July 27.<p><p>In the middle of winter, in contrast, daytime is very short. In the south of the country daylight in December lasts only for 6 hours. In northern Lapland a period of darkness prevails at that time, with the sun not rising above the horizon at all. In the far north of Lapland (69-70 °N) the sun stays below the horizon for the whole of December and the period of gloom does not end until January 16. But in Sodankylä (67.3 °N) the sun is below the horizon only for a few days around Christmas.<p><p>In the middle of winter it is memorable to experience the dawning of a day on the southern sky around noon. Clear weather allows one to see outdoors for a few hours, but soon the darkness takes over. However, when the sky is clear, it is not pitch black. A layer of clean white snow increases the brightness by as much as 80%, because artificial lights and moonlight are reflected off it. It is only completely dark when very thick cloud covers the sky and there is drizzle or mist.<p><p>Moonlight provides its own splendid atmosphere on the fells, not to mention the glowing of the Northern Lights in the grey-blue sky. The period of grey is really long throughout the country in the winter, 1.5 hours before dawn and the same duration after sunset. On clear days the beautiful, blue-tinted grey can be enjoyed for a long time, much longer than in central and southern Europe.<p><p>Finland is situated right in the far north, between latitudes 60 – 70 °N. At similar latitudes in other parts of the world, such as Siberia and Canada, it is much colder than in Fennoscandia. In the autumn and winter in particular the weather in Finland is dominated by troughs of low pressure that form over the North Atlantic and usually come to Finland from the west or southwest. As far as weather coming from the Atlantic is concerned, Finland is situated behind the Scandian mountain range, which separates Norway from Sweden. Both the Scandian mountain range and the landmass of southern Scandinavia reduce the effect of storms and rainfall before they reach Finland. Conversely, Finland is quite close to the Arctic Ocean, from where the northern winds bring cold, although clear and bright, freezing weather in winter.<p><p> <p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>In summer Finland receives doses of cold air from the north and northeast. The cold air first arrives in Lapland, from where it spreads rapidly to central and southern parts of the country. Sometimes in January or February continental winter high pressure that has formed in Siberia moves westwards and brings dry but icily cold weather to Finland, especially the eastern part of the country as well as Lapland.<p><p>Finland’s northern location and the closeness of a big ocean can be clearly seen in the climate statistics (tables for a number of localities for the period 1981-2006). They show the weather statistics at both average and record values. You can make comparisons with the climate of your own country.<p><p> <p><p>© Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>The climate is becoming warmer all over the world, including Finland, where in the 2000s summers have often been warmer than usual. Hot spells are more frequent and they last longer. In Finland, days when the highest temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius are recorded as hot days. Some increase in summer rainfall is also expected. The summer rains accumulate from numerous showers. Spells of dry summer weather with no rain are likewise forecast to become longer.<p><p>Hot and record-dry summers or comfortably warm summers with heavy rainfall have been experienced in Finland for more than ten years. The last cool summer occurred in 1998.<p><p>Although in the long term Finnish summers will become warmer, the weather will still vary greatly; during daytime the sun will shine and showers, accompanied by thunder, will moisten the ground.<p><p>In summer, even after a chilly night, the temperature in the morning rises to between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, and the weather warms quickly towards the afternoon. From the Midsummer festival (around June 24) to mid-August afternoon temperatures are typically between 20 and 23 degrees, and in Lapland, too, they are often about 20 degrees. Sometimes cool air spreads from the Arctic Ocean over the whole country. Then the temperature is only 10 – 15 degrees in Lapland during daytime and 15 – 18 degrees in southern and central parts of the country. On cool days it is also often cloudy for part of the day.<p><p>Sometimes in summer tropically warm humid air reaches Finland from the southeast or south, raising the daytime temperature to close on 30 degrees or more. Heavy thunderstorms with pouring rain often occur on such days. Sometimes continental high pressure from Siberia moves westwards in summer, bringing very dry, hot weather to Finland. The highest summer temperatures in Finland during the 2000s have varied between 30 and 33 degrees.<p><p>In Finland a day is called hot when the afternoon temperature is at least 25 degrees. This criterion was met in June 1999 (22 hot days), July 2003 (27 hot days) and August 2002 (26 hot days). Even at the beginning of September such temperatures are recorded occasionally in southern Finland.<p><p><p><p> <p><p><p><p>There is relatively little rain in Finland in early summer. The average rainfall in May and June is 40 – 60 mm, compared with 65 – 85 mm in July and August. Summer precipitation is normally in the form of brief rain or thunder showers.<p><p>A summer shower in Finland usually lasts for about half an hour. Very few summer days are cloudy or rainy all day long. If there is high pressure, the weather is generally sunny and dry, even if fair-weather cumulus clouds (Cumulus humulis) may develop into thunderstorms (cumulonimbus) in the afternoon. Finland’s coast is sunnier than the interior and has less rainfall. At the beginning of summer it is very sunny on the coast because the sea breeze from the cool sea keeps the rain clouds inland in the afternoon. Only towards evening can they move from inland towards the coast as the wind weakens. When there is a strong ridge of high pressure, the longest spells of dry weather last 2 – 3 weeks.<p><p>Average rainfall from June to August varies from 180 millimetres on the coast and in northern Lapland to 225 millimetres inland. Typical rainfall on a summer’s day is 2 – 4 millimetres. Heavy rain showers, however, easily bring between 20 and 40 mm of rain. In a dry summer, such as 2006, it rained less than a half of the average and in places on the coast only a quarter compared with the long-term average. Then again, in the rainiest summers rainfall may reach 300 – 450 millimetres, the years 2004 and 2005 being examples of this.<p><p><p><p>In summer winds are much lighter than in autumn or winter. In summer the air is often quite calm at night. The wind stirs in the morning as the sun heats up hill and dale. In summer, and winter, too, the prevailing direction of the wind is between south and southwest. The direction of the coastal sea breeze on the Gulf of Finland is between south and southwest but on the Gulf of Bothnia it blows from the west. The effect of the sea breeze extends 10 – 20 kilometres inland from the coast. At night the sea breeze weakens and the coastline becomes calm. At night a contrary land breeze stirs on the sea. Thunder clouds form their own strong gusty winds, thunder squalls, and weather bulletins include warnings about them for land areas and coastal and inland waters.<p><p>Many coastal towns advertise themselves as being the sunniest places in Finland in the summer, which, according to the sunshine statistics, holds true compared with localities inland. The sun shines most at sea in the southwestern archipelago and on the coast. The average number of hours of sunshine on the coast in May and June is more than 300, whilst inland the figure is slightly lower. In July, because of rain and thunder, there are fewer than 300 hours of sunshine, and as the days shorten, especially in August, the sun shines less.<p><p>Because in the north the sun is above the horizon in the middle of summer for a long time, it is possible to enjoy sunlight on clear days for 18 – 19 hours in southern Finland and 24 hours in Lapland. On a typical summer day including the shade from rain and thunder clouds, it is possible to enjoy an average of 9 – 10 hours of sunlight per day. In Finland, too, ultraviolet radiation from the sun is strong on either side of midday in summer. Protecting oneself from sunshine between 11.00 and 15.00 is highly recommended.<p><p>In the middle of summer (July-August) enormous thunderclouds can develop in Finland, almost like in the tropics. Flashes of lightning are frequent and heavy rain is also part of the picture. Hailstones may also fall but they are fairly rare. Widespread storm systems that cause damage occur less frequently than once every other summer. With warming of the climate, the frequency of violent thunderstorms may increase.<p><p>Thunderstorms are more frequent in July than in the other summer months, usually on more than 5 days. In the period May to September thunder occurs on average 12 days in southern and central parts of the country,but less frequently on the coast and in northern Finland. The number of thundery days per year varies from 6 to 20.<p><p>Photo: Eija Vallinheimo/FMI<p><p>In Finland summer weather fades into autumn as August comes to an end. In Lapland autumn weather starts at the end of August, with the advent of the first real frosty nights. In Lapland the period of colourful autumn foliage begins,lasting a few weeks and steadily moving southwards. In southern Finland,especially on the coast, summer temperatures linger until mid-September. There are a few days of summer warmth at the beginning of September. In September, too, the first snow usually falls in the north, but soon melts away.<p><p>The autumn equinox, when day and night are of equal length all over the world, occurs on September 21. Thereafter, the days become shorter every day until Christmas.<p><p>At the end of October the temperature is about six degrees lower than at the beginning of the month. At the beginning of the month the average daytime temperature in Lapland is 5 degrees and in southern Finland 10 degrees, whereas at the end of the month it is just below zero during the day in the north and 5 degrees in the south. Sometimes there are frosty nights and mornings in southern Finland, too, and the first snow in central parts of the country often falls in October.<p><p>By November the change to normal time has been made and the daylight keeps getting shorter. November is also the time of winter storms. Deep troughs of low pressure coming from the Atlantic bring stormy winds and rain. There are, on average, four stormy days in Finnish sea areas in November, which shows that stormy winds do not blow in Finland all the time. Precipitation may start as snow, but the further south it moves the more likely it is to fall as rain.<p><p>Photo: Eija Vallinheimo/FMI<p><p>The changeover to winter weather in Finland takes place fairly quickly in November and December. Winds blowing from the north bring cold air from the Arctic Ocean. In Lapland the weather is wintry in November. In fact in northern Finland in general and in parts of eastern Finland, too, the ground is usually already covered in snow in November. Southern and southwestern parts of the country get a permanent snow cover in December. This is preceded by several snowfalls that usually melt away. For example, the average date for the start of the permanent snow cover in the Helsinki region is Christmas Day, December 25. In the extensive archipelago off the southwestern part of the mainland the snow cover does not become permanent until the New Year.<p><p>The increasing mildness of winter is apparent in the 2000s in weather statistics: rain and drizzle are more common than they used to be. It often rains in December, sometimes even in January and February. Temporary thaws accompanied by rain do not melt the snow in Lapland, although they do further south. During the past 15 years record mild early winters have been experienced, in 2006 for example, when it was almost December before the first snowfalls occurred in the north. The warming of the climate is making winters start later than previously throughout the whole country.<p><p>Winter is the longest season in Finland. According to climatic definition, when the average daily temperature remains below zero, it is winter. Winter weather in the southwestern archipelago, when the sea is ice-free, lasts about three months (December-February) and in northern Lapland more than six months, from mid-October to the end of April. In the central part of the country winter weather usually prevails from November to the beginning of April, and in the interior of southern Finland from December to the end of March.<p><p>Winter in Finland includes days when the temperature is above zero. There are, on average, 6 – 10 such days, often with drizzle or rain, in each winter month in the south of the country, and 2 – 8 days in central Finland. In really mild winters it even rains for a few days in Lapland. In winter the drizzle is often freezing, and this makes road conditions very slippery. Radio stations issue warnings about the hazardous conditions which require extra caution from road users.<p><p>The coldest time in midwinter (the period from December through February) is January in Lapland, and the beginning of February in a typical winter in the south. The temperature on a winter day is determined to a large extent by whether cold, dry air has flowed to Finland from the north, in which case the weather is clear, or a moist, windy and cloudy thaw, warmed by the Atlantic, has moved in from the southwest. In winter the sun does not warm the air as it is low, close to the horizon. But the situation changes rapidly in February-March, because in March, around the time of the vernal equinox, the warming effect of the sun is already considerable. This is particularly so in Lapland. In Lapland’s glistening snow in March – April sunshine can raise the temperature from 15 degrees below zero in the morning to above zero later in the day. In clear weather the sun gives off a maximum of 20 degrees of heat. Further south change in temperature over the course of a day is somewhat smaller than in Lapland.<p><p><p><p>Winter weather arrives first in the north. In Lapland the tops of the high hills, or fells, generally receive their first coating of snow at the end of August or in September. A permanent snow cover settles on northern and central Lapland on average after mid-October. It is usually preceded by 2 – 3 snowfalls that melt away. The timing of the start of permanent winter varies greatly in different years. In the province of Oulu and in central Finland the first snow typically falls in October, but the period of permanent snow cover does not begin until about a month later. On the coast, as long as the sea is free of ice, the snow cover appears and melts numerous times at the beginning of winter. In Helsinki, for example, the snow cover melted away 14 times in the early stage of the winter of 1992-1993.<p><p>The southwestern part of the country and the coastal areas receive a permanent snow cover during December on average, and it arrives earlier inland than by the open sea. The Åland Islands and the Turku archipelago are the areas with the shortest period of snow cover. In both areas the snow comes at the turn of the year and the final remnants melt away at the beginning of March at the latest.<p><p>The snow cover is usually at its deepest in mid-March, although in Lapland the maximum is not reached until early April. In a typical winter the greatest snow depth is only 10 – 30 cm in southwestern Finland, in the western province of Ostrobothnia and on the coast. In southeastern and eastern Finland the snow cover is between 40 – 70 cm in the middle of March. In the hilly areas of eastern Finland, in the region of Kainuu and in most of Lapland the snow cover amounts to 60 – 100 cm in early April. The depth of the snow cover depends on the type of winter weather and it can vary greatly from the long-term average. Snowfalls and the depth of snow cover are decreasing as the climate becomes warmer. The duration of the snow cover is gradually shortening at both ends.<p><p>In spring, specifically in March, snow melts fairly quickly because the sun then gives off a great deal of warmth. At this time of year, the snow softens into crystals during the day and some of it melts, but with freezing temperatures at night it solidifies once again. The southern slopes lose their snow cover quickly because the sun’s rays are directed on them. In the forests and shaded places on northern slopes snow disappears 1 – 2 weeks later than in open spaces. In coastal regions and the south of the country the snow cover has disappeared completely by the beginning of April. The earth reveals itself in eastern Finland and the province of Oulu between the end of April and May 10. Only in central and northern Lapland can the snow cover locally linger until the end of May.<p><p><p><p>The windiest periods are autumn and, in particular, the winter months. In Finland’s maritime areas storm-force readings (more than 21 m/s) are recorded on average on four days in November, December and January. The number of stormy days per year fluctuates greatly. The windiest winter in recent decades was in 1992 – 1993, when there were 30 days of storms in Finland’s maritime areas between November and January. And in November 2001 there were exceptionally severe autumn storms, which caused damage to forests in inland areas.<p><p>Photo: Eija Vallinheimo/FMI<p><p>The months of late winter and spring are March, April and part of May. Springtime is characterized by light winds, clear weather and sunshine during the daytime. This pattern is, however, sometimes interrupted by troughs of low pressure arriving from the southwest and bringing snow and sleet and a cold spell in spring as late as May. The evenings have already been light for several weeks. Spring starts in the southern part of the country first, and spreads out in a good seven weeks over the entire country. In March-April the sun sheds powerful warmth on the dark forests and the ground, which has reappeared from under the snow. In spring, snow and the ice on lakes and on the sea melt. In the south lakes and rivers lose their ice cover at the end of April, while in the north this occurs during May.<p><p>In spring the temperature varies greatly between night and day as the sun brings warmth during the daylight hours. On a clear night the temperature often falls below zero. Around dawn, in southern and central parts of the country, as the sun rises, the lowest temperatures are below zero. In Lapland they are well below zero. In March, in fact, the temperature there can drop to minus 30 and in April to minus 20 degrees. But on a sunny morning the temperature rises above zero rapidly. At the beginning of March the daytime temperature is typically around zero in southern and central parts of the country, but at the end of April it is already above 10 degrees. In recent years it has occasionally been as high as 20 degrees at the end of April. In northern Finland, on the other hand, the daytime temperature rises from –5 at the beginning of March to +5 at the end of April. In cloudy weather there is little variation in the temperature during the course of the day.<p><p>In spring there is little rainfall in Finland because the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere is dry after the cold winter. That is why it is often clear and sunny in spring. Although rainfall amounts are generally quite small, snow may fall persistently. Sometimes the south of Finland experiences a cold spell in May, when snow falls and the temperature is only just above zero.<p><p>In the spring the winds are much lighter than in winter. A storm-force wind on the sea is rare in the spring months; on average there is only one stormy day per month. In May, as in the other summer months, there is, according to statistics, only one stormy day in two years.<p><p>By Anneli Nordlund, senior meteorologist, Finnish Meteorological Institute, January 2008<p><p> <p><p>1.

{"title": "Concern for a precious sea - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/concern-for-a-precious-sea/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In late summer the water lapping the shores of the Baltic is warm. Children would like to go swimming but their mothers often have to stop them. The reason for this is apparent to the naked eye. Cruise passengers approaching Helsinki can see it. The water is cloudy and greyish-green, and there are great rafts of blue-green algae floating on top. Many types of blue-green algae are dangerous to humans, as the toxins they secrete damage the nervous system and liver.<p><p>The state of the Baltic Sea has caused all parties at the national, international and NGO level to take resolute action. Wastewater is being cleaned more thoroughly; attention is being paid to discharges from agriculture and to pollution caused by transportation. Consumers are more aware of the effect of their choices. So there is a light flickering at the end of the tunnel, and perhaps one day our grandchildren will be able to swim in clean water on a warm August evening. Reports by marine biologists on what is going on below the surface tell us that the Baltic is in need of urgent aid. In the Gulf of Finland, the seabed is in many places completely dead. There is no oxygen in the water and no living organisms of any kind at the bottom of the sea. In fact the Baltic is the most polluted sea in the world. Nine industrialized nations border on it; thus there are big cities and intensive agriculture putting a heavy load on the water. Moreover, the natural conditions and shape of this sea make it extremely vulnerable. It is a shallow basin in which the water is rarely replaced. Any nutrients and poisons that find their way into the Baltic stay there. <p><p>Nine countries border the Baltic Sea.<p><p>The Baltic is a small sea that lies to the north and east of the Straits of Denmark. Its average depth is only 55 metres, and even its deepest point is only 450 metres. The average depth of the Atlantic, by comparison, is two kilometres. The water in the Baltic is far less salty than Atlantic water, because the former gets surges of oxygen-rich saline water through the Straits only occasionally. A large number of rivers empty into the Baltic, and their estuaries are practically salt-free. The catchment area of the Baltic — the area from which river water flows, and with it nutrients and other pollutants — is four times the size of the sea itself. It comprises the three Baltic states and the whole of Poland, almost the whole of Finland and Sweden, and substantial parts of Denmark, northwest Russia and Belarus. Some 85-90 million people live in the catchment area, and there is a lot of heavy industry and intensive agriculture. The Baltic also carries a large amount of shipping. The load imposed on the Baltic by the activities of man is thus wide-ranging and heavy. The heaviest strain on the well-being of the Baltic comes from the untreated wastewater that is released into it. The biggest single polluter is the huge metropolis of St Petersburg. At the present time only a fraction of its wastewater is treated. But the problem is being tackled both by Russian and international action, and major improvements can be expected in the next few years. Finland’s municipal sewage has been treated before release into the Baltic for many decades already.<p><p>A sewage treatment plant in St. Petersburg.Photo: Tero Pajukallio<p><p>Finland’s biggest challenge is agriculture: artificial fertilizers used in arable farming currently account for over half of all the phosphorus and nitrogen discharges from Finland into the Baltic. Farmers are being persuaded to take action by offers of tied subsidies. If they reduce the amount of fertilizer they use, fewer nutrients get into the sea, they can create buffer zones and wetlands that adsorb them and they can adopt organic farming methods. There is still a lot to do in this respect, though. The growing prosperity of the three Baltic states, Poland and Russia has made farming more intensive there, too. Thus reducing nutrient emissions from artificial fertilizers is a problem for all the countries around the sea. <p><p>The year 1974 witnessed the signing of the ‘Helsinki Convention’ on protection of the Baltic, and this was ratified by all the countries around the sea and by the EEC. To put the Convention into effect a special Commission was set up, commonly known as HELCOM. In 1992, the HELCOM countries approved a joint protection programme designed to restore the sea’s ecological equilibrium. Experts identified the 162 worst sources of pollution, or ‘hot spots’, and devised a 20-year investment programme for cleaning them up. A summit meeting every second year works out plans for taking the work forward, and progress is monitored by a Secretariat in Helsinki. In autumn 2007, the aim is to draft an ambitious new Baltic Sea Action Plan to dramatically reduce the Baltic’s pollution level and restore its ecological equilibrium by 2021. A great deal has already been achieved. The nutrient load has been reduced, risks and discharges from shipping have been decreased, and emissions of harmful chemicals into the sea have been restricted. Discharges of DDT, PCB and mercury into the sea have been drastically reduced and in some cases halted altogether, and thanks to this the white-tailed sea eagle and seal populations have started to grow. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has put the Baltic on its list of PSSAs (Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas). The biggest passenger shipping lines operating on the Baltic have voluntarily undertaken to stop releasing all forms of wastewater into the sea. <p><p>The need to protect the Baltic is clear to everyone living along its shores. No wonder, then, that the media and ordinary people make sure that action to protect it is kept in the news. Since 2002, a Baltic Festival has been held every August, gathering musicians from all the Baltic countries in support of the common cause. The Festival was engendered by the concern and love for the Baltic shared by the eminent orchestral conductors Valery Gergiev of Russia and Esa-Pekka Salonen of Finland, and Michael Tydén, director of the Berwaldhallen concert hall in Stockholm. The programme includes high-quality concerts in most Baltic cities and on board passenger ships, as well as discussions and seminars about the state of the sea. The event is arranged in cooperation with the World Wide Fund for Nature, or WWF. The Finnish media keep a close and conscientious eye on the state of the Baltic and are active in other ways, too. At the end of summer 2007, for instance, the Finnish evening paper Ilta-Sanomat, with the WWF, launched a ‘Save the Baltic’ competition in which readers were urged to send in photographs, videos and text messages on the state of the sea. The winning picture and suggestions for ways of improving the condition of the Baltic were presented to Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen. Ordinary citizens have few opportunities to directly affect the state of the Baltic through the choices they make because the pollution comes mostly from communities, agriculture and shipping. But there is something the enlightened consumer can do, namely buy organic food from nearby and favour shipping lines that do not release their wastewater into the sea, and do not tip soapy water directly into the sea.

{"title": "Treasures of the boreal forests - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/treasures-of-the-boreal-forests/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Nordic growing conditions are harsh yet productive. The berries and mushrooms that grow in Finnish forests are part of the traditional Finnish diet, and gathering them is a pastime for many families that has been passed down through generations. The fruits of the northern forests are coveted by gourmet chefs, and are increasingly exported.<p><p>Towards the end of July, Finnish grandmothers put on boots, tie scarves around their heads to protect their hair, and then disappear into the woods. As twilight falls, they return home laden with treasures — bilberries, raspberries, lingonberries and mushrooms. Approximately 500 million kg of berries and a staggering two billion kilograms of mushrooms grow in Finland’s forests every year and the tradition of picking wild berries and mushrooms is as popular as ever, despite urbanization. One study shows that 56 percent of Finns, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, go to pick forest berries at least seven times each summer. The most enthusiastic berry pickers are elderly women: 87 percent of them in the age group 60-74 pick wild berries. Northern and eastern Finland produce the largest quantities of berries, and the people living there are the most active in picking them. In the region of Kainuu, in northeastern Finland, each household picks an average of almost 60 kilograms of berries a year. The berries are turned into juice or jam to preserve them for the winter, or frozen without processing to retain their valuable nutrients. Cleaning the berries of their leaves and stalks, putting them in freezer boxes and freezing them is a common summer occupation for the whole family. At the end of summer, kitchens are filled with the fragrance of freshly made jam or juice. Berries and mushrooms are also picked to sell. Demand well exceeds supply, which is mainly because there are not enough pickers and only a tiny proportion of what grows is gathered. In recent years, this shortfall has been partly filled by pickers from Estonia, Russia and Southeast Asia. Finland has universal rights which allow everyone to move freely around the countryside, to pick berries and mushrooms and to fish with a rod and line, without permits. Any money made from the sale of this natural produce is exempt from tax. The income from picking berries in years when there is a good harvest is a significant bonus for many households in eastern and northern Finland, and of course also for the pickers from abroad. A significant proportion of the wild berries and mushrooms that are sold are exported. This applies to more than 60 percent of bilberries and lingonberries and to more than 90 percent of ceps. Germany, Austria and other continental European countries have traditionally been the destination for these exported berries and mushrooms, but lately Japan and China have increased their demand. A new speciality that is greatly valued in Japan is the matsutake (pine mushroom) which is also found in Finland. The Finnish Forest Research Institute has started to chart the places where this species grows, and it is already being exported for Japanese gourmets. All this enthusiasm is scarcely surprising considering that Finnish berries and mushrooms are incredibly tasty. When important guests visit Finland these delicacies are practically guaranteed to be on the menu at formal dinners. Anyone who comes to Finland and is interested in new culinary sensations should try the fruits of the Finnish forest.<p><p>Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). In September, Finnish forests turn red with lingonberries. The berry is known as the red gold of the Nordic forests, and with good reason; the lingonberry is abundant, easy to pick and incredibly nutritious. Lingonberries contain large quantities of fruit acids, which give them a sharp taste, and they keep well without sugar or preservatives. Because of this, they were an important source of vitamins and other nutrients all year round in Finland long before freezers were invented. Lingonberries can be used to make jam, pastries and juice and used in porridge and various desserts.<p><p>Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). This grows in different types of forests all over Finland all the way to Lapland in the far north. In terms of the volume picked, the bilberry is one of the most important fruits in Finland, even though the harvest is prone to fluctuate significantly. Bilberries contain high levels of vitamins A, B, and C and of manganese, calcium and flavonoids. They lower blood sugar levels and are good for the eyes and stomach. Bilberries have a subtle, aromatic flavour, somewhat stronger than that of the similar, but cultivated, blueberries. They are used to make pies and desserts, whilst hot bilberry ‘broth’ is a traditional energy drink favoured by skiers in Finland.<p><p>Photo: FTB/P.Luukkola<p><p>Cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus). This is the most valued Finnish forest berry and the most expensive to buy. Cloudberries grow best on boggy terrain in northern Finland, often in places that are well hidden and difficult to reach. If someone finds a good spot with lots of berries, it remains a well-kept secret. The cloudberry is related to the raspberry but its plants do not grow as high as the latter’s. The berries are yellow or reddish and have a sweet taste. They also have rather large, hard seeds, which may take a bit of getting used to. In Finland cloudberries are regarded as a delicacy to be served on special occasions — a cream cake topped with cloudberries is often eaten at family celebrations, when golden cloudberry liqueur is served with coffee.<p><p>Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Raspberry (Rubus idaeus). Clear cutting in forests is a controversial practice but it has at least one positive consequence: a few years after timber felling, raspberry bushes will appear in the space cleared. The wild raspberry has spread remarkably along with timber felling over the last few decades, and Finns pick these berries in the same way that they pick lingonberries and bilberries for extensive home use. Wild raspberries are hardly ever sold in shops, however. They are smaller and much more tasty than cultivated raspberries.<p><p>Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Arctic bramble (Rubus arcticus). This is rarer than the aforementioned berries and is regarded as far more refined. It is also related to the raspberry, but its plants do not grow as tall. The berries are red. Sadly, the wild Arctic bramble is becoming increasingly rare, but for some years now it has also been cultivated. Most of the yield is not sold as fruit but goes for the production of liqueur.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Arctic Flavours<p><p>Cep (Boletus edulis) and pine cep (Boletus pinophilus).<p><p>These mushrooms are very common in Finland, except for the northernmost part of Lapland. As much as 90 percent of ceps picked for sale end up being exported, mainly to Italy, where they are regarded with as much respect as truffles. The volume of ceps picked each year varies significantly and their appearance is often a matter of uncertainty. In the hot summer of 2006, it seemed at first that there would be no ceps at all, until surprisingly hordes of them appeared in the space of a few weeks. An operation to gather these fungi was quickly launched, and over 300,000 kg of ceps were dispatched to central and southern Europe. In Finland, the use of mushrooms, ceps in particular, spread from across the eastern border. They are not nearly as highly valued in western as in eastern Finland. Finnish mushroom dishes are very Russian in style. Often salted and eaten as a salad, mushrooms are also used to make creamy soups, sauces and casseroles.<p><p>Photo: Arctic Flavours<p><p>Chantarelle (Cantharellus cibarius). Every time you see something yellow peeking out from the moss on the forest floor, it is worth taking a closer look and making a mental note of the exact spot, as chantarelles tend to grow in groups and in the same place from one year to the next. And better still, chanterelles never accommodate maggots, unlike many of the other delicious types of mushroom. Chantarelles grow in southern and central Finland, and are used to make sauces and soups.<p><p>Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Autumn chantarelle (Cantharellus tubaeformis). This is a mushroom that appears in late autumn and can even be picked after the first snow has fallen. You need sharp eyes when you are looking for autumn chantarelles, as they are very small and well camouflaged on the forest floor due to their brown-grey colour. But if you do find one you will often find many, many more nearby. The autumn chantarelle is, like the chantarelle, used in soups and sauces.<p><p>Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>False morel (Gyromitra esculenta). This mushroom is deadly poisonous when raw but incredibly delicious when properly prepared. It has a wrinkly brown hollow cap and can be found on the forest floor as early as April after the snows have melted. False morel soup is a delicacy that is often on the menu in early summer. In order to remove the poisonous substances the mushrooms must be boiled twice in copious amounts of water, which is then thrown away. The mushrooms are washed before each treatment. It is also essential to ensure good ventilation during boiling. False morels are also sold at markets. Sellers are obliged to ensure that buyers know how to prepare them properly and safely.<p><p>Photo: Arctic Flavours<p><p> <p><p>Pine mushroom, (Japanese: matsutake). This has not traditionally been eaten in Finland but has been included in the official catalogue of commercial mushrooms for 2007. A number of years ago, a group of Japanese tourists found pine mushrooms in Lapland and took them to be identified by Finnish mushroom experts. They turned out to be the mushroom that is called matsutake in Japanese. In Japan, the matsutake is considered a special delicacy on a par with the truffle. It is believed to have an aphrodisiac effect and a kilo can fetch hundreds of euros. The pine mushroom is a large and compact mushroom that travels well.<p><p>Mustikkakukko is a traditional dessert from eastern Finland. It combines the delicate taste of the bilberry and the robust energy of rye. Rye and bilberries are health-enhancing.<p><p>1 litre (about one quart) bilberries 1 dl (0.4 cups) sugar 250 g (1/2 pound) butter 1 1/2 dl (2/3 cup) sugar 4 dl (1 2/3 cups) rye flour 1 dl (0.4 cups) wheat flour 1 teaspoon baking powder Mix the softened butter and sugar together. Mix the rye flour, wheat flour and baking powder together and add to the sugar and butter mixture. Press about 2/3 of the dough onto the base and sides of a high-sided oven dish. Add fresh or frozen bilberries. (If you are using frozen bilberries, add 1 dessert spoon of potato starch.) Sprinkle sugar over the bilberries. Cover the bilberries with the rest of the dough. Bake for about an hour at 200 degrees Celsius (390 degrees Fahrenheit). After you have left it to cool for a while serve with vanilla ice cream, custard or whipped cream.<p><p> <p><p>A mushroom picker properly dressed for autumn in the forest.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, October 2007, updated July 2013<p><p>Some favoured berries and mushrooms that grow in Finland’s forests<p><p>Bilberry Pie (Mustikkakukko)<p><p>List of things you will need when you go picking berries or mushrooms<p>", "time": "2013-07-17T08:26:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

He was the symbol of the Finnish struggle against Soviet Russia during the Winter War of 1939–1940.

Rajajoki had been the border of Russia and Finland, or more precisely Russia and Sweden-Finland, since the Treaty of Schlüsselburg of 1323.Photo: Gunnar Strandell, SA-Kuva<p><p>Mannerheim’s record as a soldier was impressive. He fought for Russia on the battle front in both the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and in the First World War between 1914 and 1917. General Mannerheim was decorated with the St George’s Cross for gallantry and was famous for his military skill and efficacy.<p><p>Mannerheim was also an able sportsman whose horsemanship won prizes. This was evidently one of the reasons why he was chosen for the formidable task of undertaking a reconnaissance mission, on horseback through Asia, that lasted two years.<p><p>Mannerheim’s passport: “Order of the Imperially appointed minister to grant a passport. The Russian consul has stated that this man will come from the Russian-Chinese border to Xinjiang to visit certain localities and to see old monuments. He is to be given a passport and allowed to visit the places that he desires, and in addition he is to be protected. Given as a certificate to the Russian authorities. On the 27th day of the fourth month of the 32nd year of the reign of (Emperor) Guangxu (1906).”Photo: National Board of Antiquities<p><p>You could add courteous manners to the list of Mannerheim’s merits. This contributed to the progress of the young cavalry officer in high society and at the imperial court itself.<p><p>A non-Russian officer in the Imperial Army was no rarity. In fact, there were thousands of them. Many of these inorodtsy or “non-orthodox” subjects of the emperor serving in the Russian army came from the Baltic provinces, spoke German as their mother tongue and were Lutheran by religion, as was Mannerheim.<p><p>Mannerheim at Lanzhou, during his fact-finding journey to China, 1906-08.Photo: National Board of Antiquities<p><p>However, Mannerheim’s background differed from that of his Baltic brother officers. He came from the Grand Duchy of Finland, which sent more than 4,000 officers to serve in the Russian army between 1809 and 1917. Almost 400 of them reached the rank of general or admiral.<p><p>Most of the officers from Finland spoke Swedish as their mother tongue, Finnish being used mainly as a second language, if they knew it at all. Mannerheim’s Finnish before 1917 was far from fluent.<p><p>However, in common with the Baltic German officers, the Finnish officers served the emperor impeccably. In fact, there are no records of disloyalty among the Finns, even during the period from 1899 to 1917 when Russia began to pressure Finland by undermining its juridical status. In lieu of disloyalty, some of the officers chose to retire from active service.<p><p>Mannerheim did not retire. He remained a faithful soldier even though he privately deplored the emperor’s policies, which he regarded as unwise. Even when his own brother was exiled to Sweden, Mannerheim’s loyalty to the emperor remained unshaken. His relatives understood his position.<p><p>Mannerheim reads a newspaper on the porch of Stormhällan villa in 1926. In 1920, he rented Iso Mäntysaari, an island near Hanko in southwestern Finland. He later bought it and renamed it Stormhällan.Photo: Otava Publishers<p><p>It was only when the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 crushed the old order that Mannerheim realised his ties of loyalty to Russia had been cut. After the revolution he became a champion of the White Finnish cause.<p><p>His loyalty towards his native land was now total and he always respected its democratic institutions even though he was hardly a true democrat by conviction.<p><p>Mannerheim’s career in the service of two states is an intriguing story that excites curiosity. To Russians, Mannerheim is above all the cultivated young officer of the Chevalier Guards who stood by Nicholas II during coronation procession.<p><p>In Finnish eyes Mannerheim stands tall as the elderly marshal, a man of honour and a fatherly figure whose moral integrity and intelligence could always be trusted.<p><p>Mannerheim in parade uniform as an officer of the Chevalier Guards of Her Majesty the Empress Maria Feodorovna.

{"title": "J.V. Snellman, without him where would Finland be? - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/j-v-snellman-without-him-where-would-finland-be/", "review": "", "content": "<p>More than two centuries after his birth, Johan Vilhelm Snellman remains one of the most influential architects of Finnish society. Philosopher, scholar, journalist and politician, he came to acquire towering importance for the genesis of Finnish literature, and, ultimately, Finnish national identity.<p><p>Johan Vilhelm Snellman was born on May 12, 1806 in Stockholm, Sweden, where his father was a sea captain. After the Russian takeover of Finland in 1808 and 1809, and the establishment of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, his family moved to the Finnish coastal town of Kokkola in 1813. When Snellman’s mother passed away only one year later, he was sent to school in Oulu, northern Finland, where his aunt lived.<p><p>Snellman matriculated from school at the age of 16. He then studied at the Academy of Turku – which was relocated to Helsinki in 1828 and became the Imperial University – and gained his Bachelor’s degree in 1831. During his studies, Snellman became friends with Elias Lönnrot and Johan Ludvig Runeberg, both of whom would have significant impact on his future endeavours.<p><p>After finishing his doctoral thesis on Hegel, Snellman was appointed to the post of lecturer at the Imperial University in 1835. As an ardent opponent of Russian rule over Finland, he refused to take orders from the Russian-influenced university directorate on what and how to teach. Eventually, despite being highly popular among students, Snellman was temporarily suspended, in 1838, after a judicial action aimed at increasing the government’s control over dissent among academic personnel.<p><p>Consequently, Snellman voluntarily exiled himself to Sweden and Germany in 1839, and did not return to Finland until 1842. It was during these years that his ambitions in academic and political life began to crystallise: he wanted to awaken Finnish national consciousness.<p><p>In the mid-1800s, Swedish was the language spoken by Finnish political and economic elites. Snellman believed that increasing the use of Finnish was a way for Finland to avoid assimilation by Russia. He stressed the importance of literature in promoting a sense of national identity.<p><p>Until the nineteenth century, however, there had been almost nothing published in Finnish apart from religious works. This void was eventually filled by Kalevala, the Finnish folk epic and single most important work of Finnish literature. The book was compiled by Snellman’s friend Lönnrot. Another important publication was The Tales of Ensign Stål, a collection of poems authored by Runeberg. The first poem of the cycle, entitled Our Land, was soon set to music, and later became the national anthem of Finland.<p><p>When Snellman returned to Helsinki, his popularity had increased further. Nevertheless, he quickly learned that his pro-Finnish opinions and aims did not please the Russian rulers. He was considered a radical extremist, and the political quandary prevented the University from employing him. Snellman thus moved to Kuopio, in eastern Finland, where he became headmaster of a school.<p><p>The school in Kuopio, E. Finland, where Snellman taught.National Board of Antiquities<p><p>From Kuopio, Snellman begun to publish two periodicals. Maamiehen ystävä (English: ‘The Countryman’s Friend’), the only newspaper published in Finnish at that time, was aimed at ordinary Finnish folk to strengthen their national identity and enhance their language skills. Saima, written in Swedish, emphasized the duty of the educated classes to take up Finnish, spoken by 80 per cent of the population at that time, and develop it into a language that could be used in academic work, fine arts, statecraft, and nation-building.<p><p>Saima was regarded as highly controversial, especially by the targets of its criticism, and it was ultimately banned by the government in 1846. The views expressed in the paper nevertheless remained in public discourse and Snellman received wide support for his views.<p><p>In 1849 Snellman returned to Helsinki, where he was again rejected, this time for a professorship at the University, leaving him and his family in economic hardship until the death of Emperor Nicholas of Russia in 1855.<p><p>The Senate Building, Helsinki 1851 (half-tone lithograph, F.Liewendal).Photo: Harald Malmgren/National Board of Antiquities<p><p>In 1856, Snellman was, to the great satisfaction of politically interested Finns, finally appointed professor. Seven years later, he was nominated for a cabinet post in the Senate of Finland, in effect as the Minister for Finance. As a senator, Snellman was able to pass a language decree, which gradually gave Finnish a position equal to that of Swedish within the Finnish government, and thus effectively in the entire country. Moreover, Finland’s own currency, the markka, was introduced in 1865 mainly as a result of Snellman’s efforts.<p><p>However, Snellman, now a man of the government, was not able to retain his unparalleled popularity among all Finns. His uncompromising stand on the language issue also contributed to considerable opposition against him. Ultimately, Snellman’s inflexibility and position in the political debate, together with his old reputation as a radical agitator, accumulated too much resistance and antagonism against his person and policies. He was forced to resign from the senate in 1868.<p><p>Despite his setbacks Snellman continued to participate in political debate for the remainder of his life. He was made a nobleman in 1866 and thus acquired a seat in the Nobles’ Chamber in Parliament. Even though Snellman never lost his popularity among his pro-Finnish adherents, he had developed into a highly divisive figure in Finland’s political landscape.<p><p>Snellman died in July 1881. His statue stands in front of the Bank of Finland and his picture has appeared on Finnish banknotes. Given his colossal significance in Finnish nation-building, Johan Vilhelm Snellman is regarded by some as the greatest statesman in the country’s history.<p><p> <p><p>By Otto Utti, January 2006<p><p>Fostering national consciousness<p><p>Polemical periodicals<p><p>Man of power<p><p>Eminent statesman<p>", "time": "2011-10-07T08:09:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Bare facts of the sauna in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/bare-facts-of-the-sauna/", "review": "", "content": "<p>How should a visitor to Finland react to the following proposition?<p><p>You are invited to take off all your clothes and go to a little room heated to almost 100 degrees Celsius, where you will sit, naked, with others for a while and sweat. Then you will go outside and jump (still naked) through a small hole in the ice on a lake, the sea or whatever and refresh yourselves in the freezing water – or roll in the snow instead.<p><p>In short, “What about a sauna?”<p><p>The answer should be simple. Be courageous and say “yes” – because if you don’t you will miss a deliciously relaxing experience which will provide a vital insight into the culture and mentality of your Finnish hosts.<p><p>Saunas have existed in other cultures, but it is in Finland that they have become entwined in the national culture. In days gone by, they were the most practical place to wash during the long winters when there was no running hot water. You can still find people in Finland who were born in the sauna. Not when it was heated, of course, but it was a sterile place where hot water was available.<p><p>It is estimated that there are two million saunas in Finland, for a population of 5.3 million. Big companies and state institutions have their own saunas. The president has an official sauna, as does the prime minister. They are to be found in city apartments and in country cottages.<p><p>Traditional saunas are heated by wood, burned either in a stove with a chimney, or by a stove with no chimney. The latter – a smoke-sauna – is the original sauna and believed by most Finns to be the best. The door is closed after the wood has burned down (and most of the smoke has escaped), leaving the embers to heat the sauna to the proper temperature, but giving a soft heat and the aroma of woodsmoke.<p><p>All saunas have a basket of rocks heated by the stove on which to throw water to increase the humidity. Called löyly in Finnish (for pronunciation, contact your host), the steam increases the feeling of heat and makes you sweat.<p><p>Basic etiquette in the sauna is quite simple. You first take all your clothes off – something you have to try not to be shy about. It is considered polite to shower before going in. Otherwise, there are few rules. Stay in as long as you feel comfortable, and return to the sauna several times if you wish.<p><p>When you come out of the sauna, jump into a lake, or roll in the snow. Or – and this will be the case for most foreign visitors – simply take a shower. But if you do roll in the snow, make sure it is fresh and powdery: old, icy snow can have an effect on your skin like sandpaper.<p><p>In summertime, you may also be handed a vihta – a bunch of birch branches which you dip in water and with which you then gently flagellate yourself. This is not as kinky as it sounds – it stimulates the circulation and gives fresh aroma.<p><p>In some hotel saunas the tradition of the washing-lady survives. She takes care of washing you; don’t be shy.<p><p>An invitation to sauna from business contacts you have never met before is perfectly normal. If you want to take the initiative yourself, almost all hotels have good saunas, though mostly heated by electricity.<p><p>I once took three American journalists to a sauna in a big hotel. The men were a little bit shy so we decided they could keep their swimming trunks on. In the middle of a good löyly, the door swung open and a large old Finnish woman entered the room. She simply pointed at the first, horrified American and said bluntly: “You first, underpants off.” I had forgotten to tell them about the washing-lady.<p><p>This article was first published in the Financial Times.<p><p> <p><p>By Joe Brady<p><p>Allow yourself a reasonable amount of time: the sauna is a place for relieving stress and tension – unhurriedly.<p><p>Have a shower before entering the hot room.<p><p>Place a small towel on the bench to sit on, both for hygienic reasons and because the bench may feel rather hot.<p><p>The temperature in the hot room is a matter of preference but the Finnish Sauna Society recommends from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius. Some people, however, are quite happy in 70-degree heat. What is universally agreed by responsible sauna bathers is that competing to see who can stand the most heat is both silly and unhealthy.<p><p>Increase the humidity by throwing water on the stones and after a few minutes of perspiring refresh yourself in the shower or with other clean water. People with heart complaints or high blood pressure should avoid swimming in cold water after leaving the hot room.<p><p>If you are enjoying the sauna experience, go back into the hot room to perspire more and whisk yourself with the bundle of leafy birch twigs known in Finnish as a vihta. Use of the vihta, or sauna whisk, is not essential (and you may not be able to obtain one) but it does enhance the cleansing effect of the sauna by opening up the pores.<p><p>You can repeat the heating and cooling process as many times as you wish: in Finland most people would have at least two sessions in the hot room. Washing with soap or shampoo is generally part of the sauna routine, usually towards the end of the whole procedure.<p><p>Get dressed only after the your body temperature has returned to normal and you have stopped perspiring.<p><p>The following words of advice from the Finnish Sauna Society are worth remembering: “Big meals and alcohol should be avoided before the sauna.” However, “the sauna leaves you not only content but also thirsty and hungry.” Then, of course, refreshing drinks should be taken to quench the thirst and restore the body’s fluid balance. What you drink depends on local custom. The Finns usually enjoy low-strength beer – nice and cold.<p><p>By Mikko Norros, December 2001; updated May 2009<p><p>Some additional tips for newcomers to the sauna<p>", "time": "2014-01-08T09:22:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Ever since the Middle Ages novelties from the west have come to Finland via Sweden, and from the east originally from Novgorod; indeed some have arrived directly from Stockholm and St. Petersburg. For example, the Finnish cold buffet has been influenced by both the Swedish smörgåsbord and the Russian zakuska table. In the early twentieth century, Finnish, German, Swedish and Russian master chefs worked in the kitchens of Finnish restaurants creating food according to the precepts of French cuisine.<p><p>The elegant interior of Chez Dominique.Photo: Katja Hagelstam<p><p>Today gastronomic experiences, inspiration and new ideas are taken from all over the world and then combined and applied to create a truly original Finnish cuisine. The six Michelin stars that have been awarded to four restaurants in Helsinki (Chez Dominique, Demo, Carma and Postres) are an indication of the high quality of restaurants in the capital, the excellence of their personnel and the professional success of their head chefs.<p><p>Fish, game, forest mushrooms and wild berries – pure ingredients with striking flavours – form the basis of Finnish gastronomic culture, and the four seasons, each with its own food varieties, bring their own contributions. Burbot stew in the middle of winter, blinis and burbot roe at Shrovetide, mämmi (a pudding made from rye flour and malt) and roast lamb at Easter, new potatoes and herring at Midsummer, crayfish in August, game in Autumn and ham at Christmas – each of these dishes tastes best when eaten at just the “right time”.<p><p>Fresh fish is available all year round, and it is prepared in a variety of ways. The old recipe for salting – two handfuls of fish and one of salt – seems rather extreme in modern cooking, in which salmon, whitefish and perch are marinated and flavoured only lightly. Steamed zander served with spinach, a timbale of smoked perch with a chervil sauce and pumpkin flower stuffed with minced salmon, and Baltic herrings on a bed of lettuce with French white wine are some of the finest piscine delicacies. In Finnish restaurants, zander, a freshwater pikeperch, is used in many of the classic dishes. It is said that fish that live in cold water taste best.<p><p>The 1930s décor of the Savoy Restaurant in Helsinki (interior design by Alvar Aalto).Photo: Katja Hagelstam<p><p>Reindeer, elk and wildfowl offer excellent and highly appreciated foods. Reindeer hash, made from strips of frozen reindeer meat served with mashed potatoes and lingonberry relish, is one of the best-known reindeer dishes. Cold beer makes a suitable accompaniment for this simple, wholesome fare, while reindeer bundles stuffed with mushrooms and blue cheese are best accompanied with French red wine. Modern executive kitchens serve elk filet stuffed with spinach, apricots and goat cheddar cheese, flavoured with balsamic syrup and topped with Soignon goat’s cheese. The filet is served with sweet potato, Portabella mushrooms, baby fenugreeks and elk sauce. Broiled wildfowl such as ptarmigan and pheasant are seasoned in the homely old-fashioned way with just salt and white pepper.<p><p>Wild mushrooms go well with both meat and fish. The mushroom season starts in the spring with morels, which are used in soups and stews. The first ceps and chanterelles come out after Midsummer. A warm chanterelle salad, grilled whitefish with a crayfish sauce and a berry tart make a splendid late summer meal. The popular food culture of eastern Finland included russulas, milkcaps and nearly all other edible fungi. In the manors and vicarages of western Finland, on the other hand, only ceps and chanterelles were eaten.<p><p>Cloudberry mousse.Photo: Katja Hagelstam<p><p>Finnish berries – strawberries, bilberries, raspberries, lingonberries, cranberries, cloudberries, sea buckthorn and arctic brambleberries – are mostly aromatic wild varieties. They are excellent in cold puddings, parfaits and ice cream. Indeed, cranberries, sea buckthorn, arctic brambleberries and cloudberries served with ice cream and a liqueur are typical items on the dessert menus of executive restaurants. A delicious cloudberry whip is served with fresh cloudberries and a sauce made with cloudberry liqueur. Frozen redcurrants with a hot butterscotch sauce provide an ideal dessert to follow a main course of reindeer meat. Berries also make excellent garnishes for meat and game dishes. The homely Finnish dish of liver casserole is served with melted butter and a relish of puréed lingonberries. Filet of reindeer is served with morels and cranberries or with a creamy sauce flavoured with lingonberries, and blackcurrant jelly is used to flavour reindeer sauce.<p><p>Ice cream has maintained its place as the queen of desserts for a couple of centuries now, although tastes have changed. A hundred years ago, people favoured ice cream flavoured with fresh pineapple, almonds, chestnuts and other nuts. Ice cream with foreign canned fruits and chocolate sauce was regarded as a delicacy in the 1950s. In the present century, wild strawberry ice cream with a garnish of puréed wild strawberries is typically served as a dessert at lunch. The purée of wild strawberries is flavoured with strawberry liqueur and Koskenkorva vodka. Crème caramel is served with vanilla ice cream, and a chocolate flan is accompanied by blackcurrant ice cream, blackcurrant sauce and coffee ice cream sweetened with coffee syrup. Pastries, often made from wheat bread or crumble, tarts and pies are sweets that can also be enjoyed with coffee.<p><p>A cheerful crayfish party closes the summer season in festive mood.Photo: Katja Hagelstam<p><p>The crayfish parties of late summer evenings are an integral part of Finnish culinary culture. In the old days the crayfish was the main item, and these gatherings reached a climax when hundreds of carefully boiled and chilled crayfish accompanied by bottles of ice-cold schnapps were carried to the table, wafting an aroma of dill. Since those days, crayfish parties have become lighter. Today lake crayfish are eaten as a starter, followed by a main course of fowl, for example mallard, and wild berries as a dessert. Crayfish butter and crayfish tails are still used in restaurants all year round. Lake crayfish tails flambéd with cognac, crayfish butter and chopped dill are used to give a final touch to the flavour of crayfish soup.<p><p>Until the mid-nineteenth century, the fare of the common people consisted largely of cereals, fish and milk products; in other words, bread, porridge, salted fish and buttermilk. The meeting of eastern and western cultures is still apparent in the dietary traditions of ordinary folk in Finland. The border between the two is usually drawn by a line running from the Kymijoki river in the south-east to the town of Oulu on the northern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Northern Finland belongs to both the east and the west according to what aspects of folk culture are taken as criteria. In western Finland, people ate hard rye bread, in the east soft rye bread, and in northern Finland unleavened bread and barley bread. The buttermilk drunk in the western parts of the country was elastic and smooth, while in the east it was thick and clotted. Previously, cheeses and sausages were only made in western Finland. The traditional leipäjuusto (bread cheese) of northern Finland and Lapland is a round fresh cheese baked over an open fire. It is sliced up, and in the Lappish tradition dunked in coffee to soften it. The softened pieces of cheese are then spooned into the mouth. Doused with cream and served with cloudberries, this cheese is also a typical Finnish dessert.<p><p>By Kirsti Grönholm, September 2008<p><p>The writer is the Director of the Hotel and Restaurant Museum.<p><p>This article is based on the book The Best Kitchen in Town, published by the Finnish Literature Society in 2007<p><p> <p><p>Seasonal variety<p><p>Plenitude from fresh water and the sea<p><p>Game in abundance<p><p>Mushrooms from the forest<p><p>Berries galore<p><p>Desserts aplenty<p><p>Crayfish – pride of the north<p><p>Popular food culture<p><p><p>", "time": "2014-06-27T08:23:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

There is very little chance of a visitor committing fundamental social gaffes or breaches of etiquette that would fatally damage relations between himself and his hosts. Such breaches are viewed by Finns with equanimity if committed by their own countrymen and with understanding or amusement if committed by foreigners. Codes of behaviour are fairly relaxed, and reputations – good or bad – are built up over time as the result of personal actions rather than conforming to norms or standards. It is difficult in Finland to make or break a reputation with a single social blunder.<p><p>Finland is a country where considerable weight is attached to the spoken word – words are chosen carefully and for the purpose of delivering a message. Indeed, there are very few other culture-specific considerations that visitors need be aware of. Finns place great value on words, which is reflected in the tendency to say little and avoid ‘unnecessary’ small talk. As the Chinese proverb puts it, “Your speech should be better than silence, if it is not, be silent.”<p><p>Finns have a strong sense of national identity. They would be happy if visitors knew something about the achievements of well-known Finns in sports and culture.<p><p>Finns have a very strong sense of national identity. This is rooted in the country’s history – particularly its honourable wartime achievements and significant sporting merits – and is today nurtured by pride in Finland’s high-tech expertise. Being realists, Finns do not expect foreigners to know a lot about their country and its prominent people, past or present, so they will be pleased if a visitor is familair with at least some of the milestones of Finnish history or the sports careers of Paavo Nurmi and Lasse Viren. Finns would be happy if visitors knew something about the achievements of Finnish rally drivers and Formula 1 stars, or if they knew that footballers Jari Litmanen and Sami Hyypiä are Finns. Culturally oriented Finns will take it for granted that like-minded visitors are familiar not only with Sibelius but with contemporary composers Kaija Saariaho and Magnus Lindberg, and orchestral conductors Esa-Pekka Salonen, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Sakari Oramo and Osmo Vänskä. While Finns are aware that Nokia is often mistakenly thought to be a Japanese company, this misconception is viewed forgivingly but with pity. They are proud that Linus Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, is a Finn.<p><p>Visitors should also be prepared to encounter the other side of the Finnish national character: Finns are chronically insecure about whether the wider world is aware of the achievements of this northern nation. Finns love reading things written about them abroad, and visitors should not feel uncomfortable being asked repeatedly what they think of Finland. However, although Finns are ready enough to criticize their own country, they do not necessarily wish to hear visitors doing so.<p><p>Most Finns belong to the Evangelical-Lutheran Church while a fraction of them belong to the Orthodox Church. The Evangelical-Lutheran Church accepts the ordination of women as priests.<p><p>As far as religion is concerned, there are very few dangers for visitors to Finland, even on subjects that in other cultures might be particularly sensitive. Most Finns belong formally to the Evangelical-Lutheran Church (about 83%), while 1.1% belong to the Finnish Orthodox Church; but people in general are fairly secular in their views. Despite this, the Church and its ministers are held in high esteem, and personal religious views are respected. It is difficult to observe differences between believers and everyone else in everyday life, except perhaps that the former lead more abstemious lives.<p><p>The number of immigrants in Finland is growing, and increasing contacts with other religions in recent years have increased the Finns’ knowledge of them, although there is still much to be desired in their tolerance for people with different religions and cultures.<p><p>There is a high degree of equality between the sexes in Finland, as can be seen in the relatively high number of women holding advanced positions in politics and other areas of society.<p><p>There are numerous women in academic posts, and in recent years visiting businessmen have also found increasing numbers of ‘the fairer sex’ on the other side of the negotiating table. The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Finland accepts the ordination of women, and there are women priests in numerous parishes. The first female Finnish bishop in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is Irja Askola. She is reigning Bishop of Helsinki since 2010.<p><p>Chauvinistic or patronizing attitudes towards women are generally considered unacceptable, although such attitudes do persist in practice. Women do appreciate traditional courtesy, although ultimately they appraise men on the basis of their attitude towards equality. Women are usually independent financially and may offer to pay their share of a restaurant bill, for instance. A man may politely refuse such an offer, but it is equally polite to accept it.<p><p>In international contexts, or when using foreign languages, particularly English, Finns have become accustomed to politically correct language in which traditional masculine terms are replaced with gender-neutral ones (e.g. ‘chairperson’); or the third person singular pronoun is offered in both forms (he/she) when they exist. In Finnish the latter problem does not exist. Instead, the third person singular pronoun hän covers both genders. There are also many titles ending with the suffix –mies (man) that are not considered gender-specific. It is appropriate for visitors to follow the established practice of whatever language they are using.<p><p> <p><p>The conception that Finns are a reserved and taciturn lot is an ancient one and does not retain the same validity as it used to, certainly not with the younger generations. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that Finns have a special attitude to words and speech: words are taken seriously, and people are held to what they say. “Take a man by his words and a bull by its horns,” says a Finnish proverb. A Finn will carefully consider what he (or she) says and expect others to do so too. He (or she) considers verbal agreements and promises binding, not only upon himself but upon the other party too, and he (or she) considers that the value of words remains essentially the same, regardless of when and where they are uttered. Visitors should remember that invitations or wishes expressed in a light conversational manner (such as: “We must have lunch together sometime”) are often taken at face value, and forgetting them can cause concern. Small talk, a skill at which Finns are notoriously lacking, is considered suspect by definition, and is not especially valued.<p><p>Finns rarely enter into conversation with strangers, unless a particularly strong impulse prompts it. As foreigners often note, Finns are curiously silent in the metro, the bus or the tram. In lifts, they suffer from the same mute embarrassment as everyone else in the world. However, a visitor clutching a map will have no trouble in getting advice on a street corner or in any other public place, since the hospitality of Finns easily overrides their customary reserve.<p><p>Finns are better at listening than at talking, and interrupting another speaker is considered impolite. A Finn does not grow nervous if there are breaks in the conversation; silence is regarded as a part of communication. Finns usually speak unhurriedly, even in their mother tongue (the pace of newsreading on Finnish TV is a source of amusement for many foreigners), and although many Finns are competent in several foreign languages, they may be wary of the speed at which these languages are spoken. Nevertheless, Finns can become excited and voluble, given the right situation.<p><p>Having once got to know a stranger moderately well, Finns are quite willing to discuss any topic; generally not even religion or politics are taboo. Finland is one of the world’s leaders in the reading of books and newspapers and the use of libraries, and thus the average Finn is fairly well informed on what is happening in Finland and in the world. Finland’s membership of the EU has increased interest in other EU countries, and the common currency, the status of agriculture and the effects of Community legislation are viable topics of conversation wherever two or three Union citizens come together. Though Finns enjoy bitching about the niggling directives of ‘Brussels bureaucrats’ as much as the next man, in general they seem to approve of EU membership and recognise its benefits.<p><p>Shared hobbies are a natural topic for conversation and exchange of opinions in Finland as elsewhere, and it can be easy to strike up a lively conversation with a Finn about culture and the arts on the one hand and about sports on the other. Sports is a particularly feasible topic because in recent years Finns have enjoyed success in sports other than the traditional long-distance running and winter sports: there are now world-class Finnish footballers, racing drivers and alpine skiers, and consequently amateurs and enthusiasts in these fields too. Golf has established itself securely especially among urban Finns, even though they are obliged to abandon this pastime for the winter months. This deprivation is an eminently suitable topic for conversation on the part of a visitor who is familiar with the world of drivers and putters.<p><p>The now ubiquitous mobile phone is revolutionizing the image of Finnish communication skills. The persistent, supposedly amusing ringing tones of the phones demonstrate how eager people are to talk to each other, especially when they are not face to face. One foreign journalist described a scene that he considered typically Finnish: a lone man sitting in a bar with a beer and speaking into a cell phone. A Finnish version of small talk? Communication without intimacy?<p><p>The use of mobile phones is governed in Finland, as indeed in other countries, by a loosely defined etiquette which forbids their use if disruptive or dangerous, so using a mobile phone is completely forbidden on aeroplanes and in hospitals. During meetings it is inappropriate. In pubs and restaurants it may be regarded by many as irritating but it goes on regardless. At concerts, at the theatre and in church it is barbaric and considerate people switch their phones off in those places.<p><p>Mobile phones have no doubt changed visitors’ perceptions of Finland. Whereas a few decades ago a visitor might report back home on an uncommunicative, reserved and introvert Arctic tribe, the more common view today is that of a hyper-communicative people who are already experiencing the future that some fear and others hope for: a society where anyone can reach anyone else, no matter where or when.<p><p>All over the world, the Internet and e-mail have radically changed how people find information and keep in touch, and Finland is no exception. For young people, using the ever-increasing range of IT applications is commonplace, and it is also an important factor in shaping youth culture. Increasingly, politicians and corporate managers set up websites and maintain personal blogs to comment publicly on their lives and views.<p><p>A Finn’s mother tongue is either Finnish, Swedish (5.6% of the population are Swedish speakers) or Saami (some 8,000 native speakers). Finnish belongs to the small Finno-Ugrian language group; outside Finland it is understood (and to some extent spoken) in Estonia. And in Sweden, too, Finnish is spoken among the large number of Finnish immigrants. Finns take care of their linguistic communication by maintaining a wide range of foreign languages in the school curriculum.<p><p>English is widely spoken in Finland and in the business community some companies use it as their house language. German is no longer widely taught but many Finns in their 50s or older learned it as their first foreign language at school. French, Spanish and Russian have grown in popularity both in schools and among adult learners. Membership of the European Union and the related practical and social demands have increased the need to study European languages, at least in the case of Finns who travel in Europe on business or are studying abroad.<p><p>Educated Finnish speakers, particularly those working in the public sector, speak Swedish to some degree whilst almost all Swedish-speaking Finns speak Finnish too. Only in some coastal areas and in the autonomous province of the Åland Islands is Swedish the dominant language, indeed in Åland it is the only official language. The status of Swedish as the joint official language of mainland Finland can be seen in the bilingual names of public institutions and in street signs, the latter case depending on the percentage of minority language speakers resident in a given municipality, and in the Swedish-language programmes on radio and TV. Swedish-speaking Finns have a distinctive culture, and their social mores are influenced by Scandinavian traditions moreso than amongst the Finnish-speaking majority.<p><p>When introducing themselves, Finns will say their forename followed by their surname. Women who use both their maiden name and their husband’s surname will state them in that order. Although Finns are conscious and proud of any official titles they may have, they rarely mention these when introducing themselves. In contrast, they do expect to be addressed by their title in professional and official contexts: Doctor Virtanen, Managing Director Savolainen, etc. Foreigners, however, are not expected to follow this practice, with the exception of the titles “doctor” and “professor” if these are known to the speaker. Otherwise, foreigners can safely address Finns using the English practice of calling them Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms, Sir or Madam, as appropriate.<p><p>The familiar form of address in Finnish (i.e. the second person singular pronoun sinä, as opposed to the formal second person plural pronoun te) is commonly used, not just between friends and acquaintances but among strangers too. It is usual nowadays for people in a workplace to address each other as sinä, up to and including senior management, at least in larger workplaces. Using sinä is common today in service occupations, too, although older people may resent the implied familiarity. However, young people still tend to address middle-aged or elderly people by the formal second person plural if they do not know the persons well.<p><p>Although the use of the familiar sinä is common, using first names requires a closer relationship. It is relatively easy to get onto first-name terms with a Finn, especially if it is evident that the parties will continue to meet regularly for business or pleasure. However, it is felt appropriate that the use of first names is specifically and mutually agreed upon. The use of first names is always proposed by the older or more senior person to the junior, or, in the case of equals, by the woman to the man; the agreement is enacted by shaking hands, making eye contact, with each party saying their first name aloud, and nodding the head. Raising a toast with schnapps, wine or champagne lends a festive air to the occasion.<p><p>Apart from this, Finns are not nearly as demanding in remembering names as many other people are. It is not usual to address people by name when greeting them (regardless of how familiar one is with them) or in the course of a normal conversation. Addressing by name has trickled into Finnish culture from the American practice, but as nice as it is to hear one’s name spoken, Finns will not be offended if they are not addressed by name.<p><p>Businessmen and persons in public office are expected to distribute business cards as a means of ensuring their name and title are remembered. There are no special rituals related to exchanging business cards in Finland. For a visitor, receiving a business card provides a convenient opportunity to ask how a name is pronounced or what a cryptic title might mean.<p><p>When meeting, Finns shake hands and make eye contact. Handshakes are brief and firm, and involve no supporting gestures.<p><p>When greeting, the parties shake hands and make eye contact. A deep bow denotes special respect – in normal circumstances, a nod of the head is enough. A Finnish handshake is brief and firm, and involves no supporting gestures such as touching the shoulder or upper arm. When greeting a married couple, the wife should be greeted first, except on a formal occasion where the hosts should first be greeted by the spouse to whom the invitation was addressed. Children are greeted by shaking hands too. Embracing people when greeting them is rare in Finland. A man greeting someone in the street should raise his hat; in the cold of winter, a touch of the hand to the brim of the hat is enough.<p><p>Finns can kiss as well as the next nation, but they rarely do so when greeting. Hand-kissing is rare. Friends and acquaintances may hug when meeting, and kisses on the cheek are not entirely unknown, although this habit is not generally found in rural areas. There is no special etiquette regarding the number of kisses on the cheek; however, most Finns feel that three kisses is going a bit far. Men very rarely kiss each other in greeting, and never on the mouth in the manner of our eastern neighbours.<p><p>Finnish cuisine has western European, Scandinavian and Russian elements. Table manners are European. Breakfast can be quite substantial. Lunch is usually eaten between 11.00 and 13.00, a typical lunch break at work lasting less than an hour. The once common long business lunches have shrunk to 90 minutes or two hours. Evening meals at home are eaten around 17.00-18.00. In most restaurants, dinners are served from 18.00 onwards. Many restaurants stop serving food about 45 minutes before they actually close, so it is worthwhile checking the serving times when booking a table. Concerts and theatre performances usually begin at 19.00, and audiences adjourn to restaurants at around 22.00.<p><p>Restaurant menus and home cooking rarely involve food that western visitors would not be acquainted with. Increased nutritional awareness has made the once heavy, fatty Finnish diet lighter, and the better restaurants can cater for a variety of dietary requirements. Ethnic restaurants, constantly increasing in number, have added to the expanding choice. Beer and wine are drunk with restaurant food in the evening, but at lunchtime these days they feature very little, if at all.<p><p>At a dinner party, the host determines the seating order if necessary. The guest of honour is seated to the right of the hostess (or the host, if it is a men-only dinner). This is a seat dreaded by most Finns, since the guest of honour is expected to say a few words of thanks to the hosts after the meal. Guests should not begin to eat until everyone has been served; usually, the host will propose a toast at the beginning of the meal, wishing his guests hyvää ruokahalua, the Finnish for bon appétit! It is not appropriate for guests to drink before this, unless the beginning of the meal is badly delayed.<p><p>Finns seldom make speeches during a meal, but they do so on formal occasions. In such cases, the speeches are made between courses. During the meal, the host may toast individual guests, or guests may toast each other, by raising their glasses and making eye contact. Once the toast is drunk, eye contact should be made again when lowering the glass to the table.<p><p>A meal normally concludes with coffee and postprandial drinks are served with it or immediately after. If the hosts allow smoking, this is the moment to bring out the cigars and cigarettes, unless of course the host has already allowed or suggested this earlier. When leaving the table, the guests should thank the hosts briefly for the fare when they get the chance, regardless of whether the guest of honour has done so or not.<p><p>It’s time for a cup of coffee. Finns drink coffee anywhere and everywhere. More coffee per person is drunk in Finland than anywhere else in the world.<p><p>Finns consume the equivalent of slightly over ten litres of pure alcohol per person per year, which is close to the European average. Drinking habits mainly follow Scandinavian and European practices. There are fewer national characteristics than one might think, considering that Finns do have a reputation for drinking; and indeed binge drinking is fairly common, as it is throughout northern Europe and parts of the UK.<p><p>However, consumption of wine and beer, as opposed to spirits, has increased in recent years, and as a result more decorous drinking behaviour has become more common. Consumption of alcohol at lunchtime is less common in the business world than it used to be, and in the public sector it is extremely rare.<p><p>Alcohol consumption varies somewhat, according to socio-economic differences and, to some extent, by region. The influence of central European or Mediterranean drinking habits is primarily visible among urban middle class young adults and slightly older Finns with tertiary education.<p><p>The import and sale of wines and other alcoholic beverages is largely controlled by the state-owned Alko organisation, and private individuals can only buy alcoholic beverages in Alko shops, with the exception of medium strength beer and cider, which can be bought in food stores. Alko is a major buyer of wines and stocks a wide and geographically representative selection of all qualities, including top labels. Many restaurants import their own wines directly from suppliers abroad.<p><p>In households wine is normally reserved for weekend meals, but meals prepared for guests or eaten in a restaurant usually involve wine. Often – and in the case of Swedish-speaking Finns, almost always – a meal is preceded by schnapps, a shot of vodka or aquavit in a tiny glass. This is considered an integral part of cold fish courses, and absolutely essential with crayfish. Swedish-speaking Finns have a custom of enlivening the occasion with a line or two of a drinking song before each shot of schnapps. Big dinner parties have an appointed toastmaster who determines the interval between shots and leads the singing. Finnish-speaking Finns have a less elaborate and less structured drinking etiquette, although there are schnapps songs in Finnish too. Schnapps is usually accompanied by mineral water, or sometimes beer, which is also commonly served with meals. Beer is also used to slake the thirst created by the sauna.<p><p>Visitors can approach Finnish drinking customs as they see fit. It is not necessary to drink a shot of schnapps in one gulp even if your neighbour does. So it is enough to raise the glass to one’s lips without swallowing. It is also perfectly acceptable to request mineral water or non-alcoholic wine with a meal. Lunch is usually accompanied by non-alcoholic beverages in any case, and non-alcoholic drinks are usually provided. Abstinence is also supported by legislation; in Finland, the blood alcohol level for drunken driving is very low, and the penalties are severe.<p><p>Tipping has never fitted very comfortably into the Finnish way of life. This may have originally been due to the traditions of a religion which emphasized frugality; today, the rather blunt reason for not tipping is that the price paid includes any unusual instances of service or politeness i.e. the view taken is that “service is included”. Tipping does nevertheless exist in Finland, and you can feel safe that while nobody will object to being tipped, very few will mind not being tipped.<p><p>As a rule, service is included in restaurant bills. However, an extra service charge is often added to bills which are to be paid by a customers’ employers. Those who pay for their own meals and in cash often choose to round the bill up to the nearest convenient figure. This does not require any complicated arithmetic from the customer, as no one cares whether the tip really is 10-15% of the total bill.<p><p>Tipping at hotels is fairly rare. If you know that you have caused extra inconvenience for the room cleaner, it would be regarded as an appropriate to leave a tip. Receptionists should be tipped only by long-term guests at the hotel. Like their colleagues across the world, Finnish hotel porters will be glad to be tipped the price of a small beer. It is also OK to leave a few coins on the bar for the bar staff.<p><p>Taxi drivers do not expect to get a tip, but customers often pay the nearest rounded up figure to the actual fare. Major credit cards are usually accepted in taxis, and in this case tipping in cash is practical.<p><p>If you are the guest of Finnish hosts, you should leave any tipping to their discretion.<p><p>Smoking has decreased in recent years, and attitudes towards it have become more negative. The law prohibits smoking in public buildings and workplaces and, being generally law-abiding, Finns have adapted to this legislation. Nevertheless, smoking is still quite common, in all age groups. International trends have increased the popularity of cigars amongst a minority of tobacco smokers.<p><p>As have many other countries, Finland has banned smoking in most restaurants and other licensed premises completely.<p><p>Smokers are expected to be considerate. When invited to a private home, a guest should ask the hosts if they object to smoking, even if there are ashtrays visible. Smokers may be guided to the balcony, which may have the effect of reducing the intake of nicotine considerably in cold weather.<p><p>The home is to a great extent the focus of social life in Finland – to a greater extent at least than in countries where it is more common to meet over a meal in a restaurant. There are cultural, and also economic, reasons for this. A growing interest in cooking and wines has led to an increase in entertaining in the home. A foreign visitor need have no qualms about being invited into someone’s home; he can expect a fairly relaxed and informal atmosphere, and sending or bringing a bunch of flowers or a bottle of wine for the hosts will be appreciated.<p><p>A greater cultural challenge for the visitor is accepting an invitation to one of the innumerable summer dwellings that dot the seashores and lakeshores of Finland. One in four Finns owns a summer cabin, and for many, it is regarded as a second home. Sociologists like to explain that the summer dwelling is a tie that Finns maintain to their rural past; and it is true that many Finns transform into surprisingly competent fishermen, gardeners, farmers, carpenters or foresters when they withdraw to their summer homes.<p><p>A guest is not expected to take part in this role-play, at least not actively. On the other hand, he is expected to submit without complaint to the sometimes primitive conditions at the summer residence, since not all of them have electricity, running water, a flushing toilet or other urban amenities Many families consider that even a TV set is incompatible with genuine summer cabin life.<p><p>A guest is expected to dress casually but practically when going to a summer cabin. The hosts will have rubber boots, raincoats and windcheaters that are worn as the weather dictates or when going fishing, picking mushrooms or walking in the forest. An experienced guest understands that under these conditions the hosts, particularly the hostess, have to go to a lot of trouble to give the guest an enjoyable stay. Help with routine chores is greatly appreciated: peeling the potatoes or the onions is a job the guest can safely offer to undertake.<p><p>The best reward for the hosts is that guests enjoy themselves, rain or shine. As for correctness, it would be polite for a guest to raise the question of departure at breakfast time on the third day, and only agree to stay longer if the hosts protest with particular conviction.<p><p>Although seasons occur everywhere, in Finland they mark the progress of the year with striking conspicuousness. Extending far beyond the Arctic Circle, Finland enjoys such extremes of temperature and daylight that it would not be too far-fetched to say that there are two cultures in Finland: one dominated by the almost perpetual daylight of the summer sun and surprisingly high temperatures, and the other characterized by mercilessly cold winters and Arctic gloom that only briefly gives way to twilight during the day.<p><p>Even though summer comes every year, it is considered so important that virtually the entire country ‘shuts down’ for the five or six weeks that follow Midsummer, which falls in late June. After Midsummer, Finns move en masse to their vacation homes in the countryside and those who do not spend their time out of doors, in street cafés and bars, in parks and on beaches, being social and feeling positive. Business and personal correspondence may be temporarily shelved, e-mails cheerfully return ‘out of the office’ notifications for a month or more, and conversations between acquaintances revolve more around how the fish are biting or how the garden is doing than around important issues of international politics or the economy. It is easy for a visitor to observe that in summer Finns are especially proud and happy to be Finns and to live in Finland, and encouraging these feelings is welcome.<p><p>With the advent of winter, Finns close down their summer dwellings, store their boats in dry dock, put snow tyres on their cars, stash their golf gear in the basement and check their skis. Whereas the rural ancestors of today’s Finns whiled away the long winter days in making and repairing tools for summer, their descendants labour in offices to make their country an increasingly efficient and modern high-tech marvel.<p><p>Finns are punctual people and, in one sense, prisoners of time. As is the case elsewhere in the world, those holding the most demanding jobs have tight daily schedules; missing appointments can cause anguish. Agreed meeting times are scrupulously observed, to the minute if at all possible, and being over 15 minutes late is considered impolite and requires a brief apology or an explanation. Concerts, theatre performances and other public functions begin on time, and delays in domestic rail and bus traffic are rare.<p><p>In general, busy lifestyles have come to stay and a diary full of meetings and negotiations is a matter of pride and a status symbol in Finland rather than a demonstration of poor scheduling. In such an environment, the time allocated for the entertaining of guests is one of the most important indicators of the value attached to the occasion. When a Finn stops glancing at his watch and suggests something more to eat or drink, or even a sauna, the visitor can rest assured that a lasting business relationship, or friendship, is on the cards.<p><p>Finns move to their vacation homes after Midsummer. One in four Finns owns a “mökki”, a holiday cabin. Finns take a dip in the lake after sauna, and finish the bathing session with sausage and beer.<p><p>Finns like celebrations and Finland’s calendar of official festivals is not very different from that of other European countries. One major difference is that the Protestant Lutheran calendar does not accommodate all the feast days of Catholic tradition. Visitors may find it strange that Finns have calm and serious festivities on occasions that would be boisterous and joyful in continental Europe.<p><p>Christmas, and Christmas Eve in particular, is very much a family festival in Finland, usually spent at home or with relatives. Customs include lighting candles by the graves of deceased family members. Finns wish each other ‘Merry Christmas’, but equally often they say ‘Peaceful Christmas’. Christmas Day is generally a quiet day and Christmastide social life does not restart until Boxing Day.<p><p>December 6 is Independence Day, an occasion marked with solemn ceremonial observances. It is a day for remembering those who fell in the wars to protect Finland’s independence, which was achieved in1917. In the evening, the President of the Republic hosts a reception for some 2,000 guests – including the diplomatic corps accredited to Finland – and watching this reception on TV has evolved into a favourite pastime for the entire nation.<p><p>In wintertime, Shrove Tuesday is just about the only festive occasion where public merrymaking can be observed, though even this is not even a pale reflection of the carnivals held in more southerly lands. Logically enough, the most flamboyant annual parties in Finland occur at a warmer time of year. May Day, internationally a festival day for workers and students, can with justification be described as a northern version of Mardi Gras, and Midsummer – the ‘night of no night’ – is an occasion for uninhibited rejoicing, as for most Finns it marks the beginning of summer holidays and a move to the summer dwelling in the countryside.<p><p>Having a sauna is something completely natural to Finns. A first timer should perhaps have a first encounter with the sauna in the company of a genuine Finn.<p><p>A nation of five million people with 1.5 million saunas has no need to acquire a formal sauna education – learning to bathe in the sauna comes as naturally as learning to speak. Visitors would do well to have their first encounter with the sauna in the company of a Finnish friend or acquaintance, rather than following a mechanical set of instructions that reduces sauna bathing to a drill by numbers.<p><p>In Finland, both men and women bathe in the sauna, but never together except within the family. There are no mixed public saunas in Finland. A visitor hesitant about having a sauna should remember that if it has been heated specially for him or her, it is a matter of pride for the hosts, and only medical constraints are an acceptable reason for not trying it.<p><p>Having a sauna is something natural to all Finns, yet people do have their own ways of bathing in the sauna. But Finn would never say to another that he is ‘doing it wrong’. It is a matter of preference. This is a good principle to follow for the visitor too: listen to your own body and follow your own rhythm in moving between the hot room, the washing room and the open air, perhaps including the lake or the sea. It is helpful to follow what others are doing, but avoid extremes: some Finns feel the need to demonstrate their tenacity by sitting in a scalding hot sauna for inordinately long periods. In such a situation, a wise visitor will quietly slip out to consume some liquid and enjoy the scenery. On the other hand, it can be equally rewarding to surrender to unknown rituals with an open mind. The feeling of being slapped on the skin with a bundle of soft birch leaves in the heat of the steam room can be a pleasant therapeutic experience.<p><p>The sauna is no place for anyone in a hurry. When the bathing is over, it is customary to continue the occasion with conversation, drinks and perhaps a light meal. A guest’s comments on the sauna experience will be listened to with interest, After all, this is a subject that Finns never tire of talking about.<p><p>By professor Olli Alho, November 2002, updated March 2010 Illustrations by Mika Launis<p><p>Identity<p><p>Religion<p><p>Gender<p><p>Conversing<p><p>Information technology<p><p>Languages<p><p>Names and titles<p><p>Greeting<p><p>Eating<p><p>Drinking<p><p>Tipping<p><p>Smoking<p><p>Visiting<p><p>Time and the seasons<p><p>Festivals<p><p>The sauna<p>", "time": "2015-03-19T08:18:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

His untiring work for the cause of peace is rewarded with the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.<p><p>Ahtisaari has without doubt received more publicity in international affairs than any other Finn in recent memory. He served as president of Finland from 1994 to 2000. Upon leaving office he founded Crisis Management Initiative, where he is chairman of the board.<p><p>Diplomats, journalists and other informed individuals see Ahtisaari as straightforward, approachable and considerate.

After national service in the late 1950s, Ahtisaari became a teacher and worked in schools in Finland and Pakistan.<p><p>From 1965 to 1973 he served in the international development cooperation department of the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In 1973 he was appointed ambassador to Tanzania, also accredited to Zambia, Somalia and Mozambique.<p><p>From then on, in the words of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, he was to “figure prominently in endeavours to resolve several serious and long-lasting conflicts.” In Tanzania he gained a reputation as a specialist in African politics.<p><p>At the request of African leaders, the UN Secretary-General appointed him UN commissioner for Namibia in 1977. The following year he became the Secretary-General’s special representative for Namibia. In announcing that Ahtisaari had won the 2008 Peace Prize, the Nobel Committee noted that in 1989 and 1990 he played a significant role in the establishment of Namibia’s independence.<p><p>Ahtisaari’s role in the Namibian independence process consisted of coordinating the often diverging positions of the UN, South Africa, the Namibian independence organisation SWAPO, the West and the Soviet Union, while forging an agreement that would be acceptable to all concerned. It took many years before all the pieces of the puzzle fell into place.<p><p>In 1999, under notably difficult circumstances, Ahtisaari crafted proposals to resolve conflict in Kosovo. When genocide was under way there, the Nato countries sought to exert pressure on Yugoslavia with an extensive bombing campaign. This did not appear to be enough in itself, and diplomatic efforts were required.<p><p>The task consisted of getting the US, its Nato allies, Russia and Yugoslavia to approve an agreement that combined all their minimum demands so that no one would feel they were suffering unduly. This time the challenge lasted only eight weeks, but was all the more hectic for its brevity.<p><p>In the autumn of 2005, Ahtisaari again turned his attention to Kosovo. He headed talks on the exceptionally complex topic of the future status of Kosovo.<p><p>The Nobel Committee recalls that in 2005 Ahtisaari and his Crisis Management Initiative (CMI) were central to the solution of the complicated matter of the Indonesian province of Aceh’s bid for independence. CMI was asked to facilitate talks between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM).<p><p>The first round of negotiations, actually the first face-to-face meeting between the parties since May 2003, took place in Helsinki in January 2005. Subsequent rounds of talks were held in February, April and May.<p><p>CMI then prepared a draft Memorandum of Understanding, which formed the basis for a fifth meeting in July. The agreement was signed on August 15, 2005. CMI was also present during the implementation phase.<p><p>Ahtisaari has also made exceptional contributions to settling conflicts in Iraq, Northern Ireland, Central Asia and the Horn of Africa. His solutions for international problems have not always been to everyone’s liking, of course.<p><p>His detractors have been particularly uncomfortable with his proposals for the future status of Kosovo. Hinting at such issues, Yuri Deryabin, eminent Russian diplomatist and former Russian ambassador to Finland, wrote in the Finnish newspaper Kaleva that Ahtisaari had not been awarded the Nobel Prize for the negotiations he had chaired over Kosovo.<p><p>Deryabin stated his belief that Ahtisaari had sincerely tried to advance the cause of peace in Kosovo, and added that he doubted whether critics had even read Ahtisaari’s proposals for that area. Ahtisaari had proposed “conditional” independence for Kosovo, which would have guaranteed extensive rights for the Serb minority.<p><p>Between the operations in Namibia and Kosovo, Ahtisaari occupied the posts of UN Under-Secretary-General for administration and management, secretary of state at the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs and chairman of the Bosnia Working Group of the UN International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.<p><p>He is a member of the board of the New York-based EastWest Institute, as well as a member of the joint advisors’ group for the Open Society Institute and the Soros Foundations, which operate in various countries. He serves as chairman of the Balkan Children and Youth Foundation and Global Action Council of the International Youth Foundation, as well of the Governing Council of Interpeace.<p><p>Until 2003 he was a member of the board of directors of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), and until 2004 chairman of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. In early October 2008, Ahtisaari was also awarded the Unesco Peace Prize.<p><p>Ahtisaari’s Nobel Prize is welcomed here in Finland, a country that devotes much brainpower and money to the cause of peace. The Norwegian Nobel Committee refers to him as an outstanding international mediator who has shown, through his untiring efforts and good results, the value of mediation in bringing peace to international conflicts.<p><p>By Joseph Brady and Peter Marten, December 2008<p><p>Great reputation<p><p>From teacher to diplomat<p><p>The Kosovo challenge<p><p>Assuaging Aceh<p><p>Several sides to every story<p><p>The value of mediation<p><p><p>", "time": "2012-11-02T11:18:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

In addition to municipal libraries, there is a network of regional central libraries and university and other academic libraries, together with a handful of special libraries, such as a library for the visually impaired that is maintained by the state. The libraries are inter-networked. This means that the services offered by all libraries are available for everyone living in Finland through inter-library loans. The aim is to place library services within the reach of all, regardless of age, domicile or state of health.<p><p>The Library Act lays down provisions on the functions of libraries:<p><p>“The objective of public libraries and information services provided by them is to promote among citizens equal opportunities for personal development, for literary and cultural pursuits, for access to knowledge for the acquisition of personal and civic skills, for broadening their world view, and for lifelong learning.”<p><p>“Library activities should also aim at promoting the development of virtual and interactive network services and their educational and cultural contents.”<p><p>Library services are free for registered users. Extra services such as photocopying, reserving material or dealing with borrowed material returned late may incur a fine that at most corresponds to actual costs. Everyone living permanently in Finland can obtain a library card, both adults and children alike, and many public libraries issue cards to people who are not permanent residents.<p><p>The amount of non-printed material available from libraries has increased in recent years. Libraries today acquire proportionally more recordings, videos, DVDs and other electronic material than they do printed books. One result of this trend is that for many, the library has become a source of digitally stored informational and cultural material.<p><p>Finnish society has experienced a period of transition and structural change known to many other countries in Europe, namely the movement of large numbers of people from the land to urban areas. Public services in general have shrunk in rural areas. But libraries are an exception due to their statutory position. Their status has remained the same or even strengthened in some cases. In many localities libraries have become important civic meeting places, cultural centres, which people visit for a variety of reasons, apart from borrowing books and recordings.<p><p>The network of libraries in Finland have long played a key role in public education and in protecting and preserving the national culture and languages. This is a fact that decision-makers and citizens both realized back in the early days of independence.

{"title": "Mirages in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/mirages-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The open sea lies before you, the spring warmth and a light wind have split the sea ice into floes that rock lazily on small waves. Beyond the horizon, on the other side of this body of water, lies Sweden. In between, there is only water — or there ought to be only water.<p><p>There are pale columns ‘dancing’ on the horizon! Looking along the shore, you see distant islands, whose low, thin silhouettes grow into steep rock faces. The entire shoreline takes on the shape of a rock wall where the familiar outlines are impossible to find; a mirage distorts the shores of Finland!<p><p>Most people’s impression of mirages comes from comic books, for instance the elusive and distant mirage of an oasis which tends to appear to Donald Duck during adventures in the desert. People consequently tend to conclude that the mirage is a phenomenon produced by the delusions of a person who is exhausted by heat and thirst, a hallucination which exists only in the imagination of that person, rather than something which can be documented in, for instance, photographs. On the other hand, most people are familiar with the shimmering pools of water that can often been seen on hot pavements on summer days. These apparent pools are not given any mystical connotations, however, even if they are in fact the same phenomenon as the mirage of an oasis in the desert: the sky and its blue colour appear to be reflected above a hot surface, producing an illusion of water, which constantly recedes out of reach before the approaching traveller.<p><p>There are a number of possible explanations for the mystique of mirages. The cold northern sea off the coast of Finland is an exotic experience in itself and has proved a fertile source for traveller’s tales but it is also an exceptionally good place for seeing incredible mirages. In the past, seafarers who had visited all kinds of faraway places and seen all kinds of marvels usually developed something of a reputation as storytellers. Their stories were often extraordinary, but talk of ships sailing upside down and the sight of palaces and vast meadows out in the middle of the ocean must have sounded particularly strange. Since telescopes and binoculars had not been invented yet, people’s imagination added the detail and colour to the stories of the things they had seen. Mirages appeared seemingly at random, they might be visible only for a brief moment, they changed shape and disappeared as you approached them, observers at different heights saw different types of mirages, and so on. The only explanation seemed to be some unknown force under the trackless waves, which had the power to shift all manner of marvels between the underwater world and the world above the surface!<p><p>The word mirage can be more accurately defined by explaining that atmospheric conditions can cause deviation of the normally straight movement of light rays, creating a situation where an object is perceived as displaced or distorted. Mirages are usually seen at the horizon and with a very small angular diameter, yet they may take a number of shapes. The shrubs and rocks on a small island may tower into the sky; low, sloping shores may be vertically stretched so they look like precipices; a ship and its deck superstructures may distort into unidentifiable boxy shapes; entire islands seem to float in the air with inverted mirages below them; a number of mirages of the same island appear, now right way up, now upside down, above the island; a ship is seen to travel along the distant horizon upside down; the setting sun looks square, splits up into slices and gives off a final, bright green flash before going down. Sailors who spend more time in Finnish waters inevitably come up against mirages; seasoned navigators and sailors who know their channels are well aware that there are conditions in which it is extremely difficult to find a familiar route among the confusing mirages obscuring a rocky shoreline; people who use radar may remember occasions on which the radar range seemed strangely limited or other occasions when the radar range seemed to extend past the normal horizon. Sometimes, there is a mention on the news for TV viewers and mobile phone users that meteorological conditions are causing transmission disturbances. Mirages caused by atmospheric conditions are everywhere; usually only as a marginal phenomenon for those who look for it, but sometimes to the extent where it interferes with our everyday lives.<p><p>On April 20, 1999 an ordinary freighter was plying the waters of Finland’s south-western archipelago. But what Pekka Parviainen saw on that day was anything but ordinary. The ship turned up in a number of different shapes; sometimes there seemed to be two ships, one of the pair upside down. Luckily Pekka had brought his video camera with him. Here is part of his footage for you to enjoy. On a day like this Finland is full of mirages!<p><p> <p><p>Air gets thinner the higher you are from the surface of the earth or the sea. In normal conditions, the density of air decreases with increasing altitude. When light rays travel along the surface of the earth, the air below the light ray is therefore denser than the air above it. One of the typical properties of light is that it refracts towards the denser medium, and thus a ray moving along the surface of the earth is in fact constantly refracted slightly downward, following the earth’s curve instead of escaping straight into space. Imagine if you will that the denser air exerts a kind of friction on the ray of light, drawing it towards itself. When we see something, we imagine that the object we are seeing is in the direction from which its light reaches our eyes. But when we look at the distant horizon, we see objects which are in fact partly below the horizon. The light from these objects is refracted in a low curve along the curved surface of land or sea, and reaches the observer’s eye from what only appears to be the direction of the horizon. Many people must be familiar with the often repeated fact that when we are looking at the setting sun, it is in fact already below the horizon. In astronomy, this phenomenon is known as refraction: the refraction of light in the atmosphere raises objects in the sky at the horizon by about half an (angular) degree.<p><p>This is all very well, but Nature has a way of surprising us: very often, the density of air does not change consistently with the altitude, and instead, colder, denser air and warmer air form layers of different temperatures at different altitudes. The movement of light in this kind of stratified ocean of air can be quite erratic, thus creating a strongly distorted image of the landscape — mirages, in other words. The stratification of the air, furthermore, is not necessarily clearly defined or stable, yet it may at times be strong enough to create at least a moment’s amazing mirages. In Finland, the conditions for mirages are particularly favourable in spring, when the sea ice thaws. Sea water of 0° C combined with a spring ‘heat wave’ of 15° C in the air can create miraculous images.<p><p>Keeping in mind that light is refracted towards colder air, let us consider some of the peculiar things you might see out at sea, for instance. In late summer and early autumn in Finland, the nights quickly get colder and air temperatures drop rapidly above the heat-retaining sea water. The sea warms a layer of air a few centimetres above the water, however, creating a thin layer of warm, thus less dense, air just above the water surface. When the light is reflected off a distant island towards the observer, it might consequently find two different paths: one ‘normal’ path travelling clearly above the surface of the water almost straight to the eye of the observer, the other moving at a low angle toward the water surface, where it is refracted at a height of a few centimetres up toward the colder air, reaching the observer’s eye from an angle below the line of sight. This means that the observer sees two images of the island, one normal and the other an inverted mirage hanging below the island. This is called an inferior mirage.<p><p>Inferior mirages are quite common. For instance, the water seen on desert sand or on hot pavement is a mirage of sky above the hot sand or asphalt. Landing aircraft in films or car races on television are often filmed from a point quite close to the surface of the hot tarmac of the runway or race track. This means that below the car or plane, you can see a mirage of the sky, but also an inverted image of the actual car or plane — its inferior mirage. In this same way, if you look at an object along, for instance, the wall of a house which is warmed by the sun, you can almost always see a mirage of the object very close to the surface of the wall. Inferior mirages by the sea in autumn are worth investigating by trying out different observation heights: the higher you are as you watch the phenomenon, the less visible it becomes. Meanwhile, the lower you go to watch the phenomenon, the thicker the slice that the mirage ‘cuts’ off the horizon to project the inferior mirage on. Sailors know this phenomenon well: islands look suspended in mid-air. The impression occurs when you watch the seascape from a boat and your eye level is between two and three metres above the water surface. A thin slice of sky above the horizon and the inferior mirage below it become ‘welded together’. The mirage of the island is seen at this height as a strongly flattened slightly rounded ‘bottom half’ of the island, outlined as a dark shape with the island itself “in mid-air along the welding seam”.<p><p>In this picture the sailing boat has almost disappeared into the inferior mirage. Only the sail is visible.<p><p>The lighthouse of Isokari, near Kustavi, in the south-western archipelago.<p><p>Another view of the Isokari lighthouse. <p><p>An inferior mirage and the mirage of a ship.<p><p>The inferior mirage as a phenomenon is rather monotonous: there is always only one inverted mirage below the object and the mirage is always more or less flattened. If the actual landscape itself is beautiful, then so is the mirage, and they may spread together across the horizon as a string of buildings and treetops. As a phenomenon the inferior mirage is, however, always identical in structure and easy enough to understand. As a phenomenon of physics, it is devoid of interest.<p><p>In spring the reverse of the stratified temperatures described above may occur over the sea or a big lake: the cold water, recently freed from winter ice, is covered by a warm layer of air from above the land. Favourable conditions for this occur when the wind blows seaward off the land. In such situations in Finland, there is often a dry, warm wind from deep within the Russian steppes, driving the first spring warmth out over the open sea. Again, the light reflected off a distant island finds two paths to the observer’s eye; again, one of these paths is almost straight from the island to the observer, but this time the other leaves the island at a slight upward angle towards the warmer air, being refracted at the boundary between the air layers down toward colder air and reaching the observer’s eye from an angle above the line of sight. This, again, creates two images of the island, one ‘normal’, but this time the other image is an inverted mirage above the island. This is called a superior mirage. The particular type of atmospheric condition which creates superior mirages is called thermal inversion, i.e. a clearly defined, lighter and less dense layer of warm air rests on top of a cold air mass. Powerful thermal inversion is also the cause of the occasional disturbances of radio and television reception and mobile phone transmissions.<p><p>A sailing boat with a typical superior mirage in the background.<p><p>A small boat with a superior mirage of islands.<p><p>A superior mirage with a sailing boat.<p><p>A house in the archipelago with a superior mirage.<p><p>The type of air layers in a thermal inversion can vary a great deal: sometimes the warm air mass is thick, sometimes it is thin and hot, sometimes there are several warm layers, and the temperature profile of the air layer near the earth and the vertical temperature gradient may fluctuate wildly. As a consequence, the superior mirages caused by this can be extremely strange. At sea, there may not be a single ‘normal’ image of an island, and instead the parts of the island at different elevations are flattened or elongated in several different ways; there may be up to four mirages above the distorted island, visible now right side up, now upside down, and flatter the higher up they are. Islands at different distances also produce different mirages. In this kind of situation, if you can look towards land from your position out at sea, the shoreline will be visible as a wall of roughly even height, where elongated mirages of lighter rocks and darker trees make speckles on the wall. On the open sea, low waves may reach into the mirage-producing air layer, where they become vertically stretched into high columns: this produces a vision of dancing columns far out to sea. If the height of the thermal inversion layer is variable, the mirage may raise parts of the sea surface up into the air, causing the appearance of ‘castles in the air’ which rise and then crumble into the waves in an instant. These exceptionally impressive mirages are also called Fata Morgana. (The phenomenon was named after King Arthur’s wicked stepsister, the sorceress Morgan le Fay, who, according to some legends, lived in a crystal palace under the waves and manifested her magical powers by creating mirages.)<p><p>In order to see mirages, you need a wide and fairly even horizontal surface that the air can form layers above. The alternation of air temperatures in the different layers at different altitudes causes vertical distortion of objects. In contrast, the formation of vertical layers of air with subsequent clear and stable horizontal mirages is not possible. The only exception is the situation mentioned before, where a wall is heated by the sun and an inferior mirage is created between an object and the wall. A mirage always has a small angular height, and therefore it is much easier to discover the phenomenon and observe it in more detail with the help of binoculars than with the naked eye.<p><p>Inferior mirages are clearly visible near a warm sea surface, but an elevation of as little as a couple of metres may cause the phenomenon to go unnoticed unless you are already familiar with it. On the other hand, as the phenomenon occurs very frequently in late summer and early autumn, it is easy to see if you make a slight effort. Superior mirages, meanwhile, are much more rare than inferior ones and also very sensitive to just the right viewing height. A deviation of as little as one or two metres up or down may prevent you from seeing the mirage at all. Therefore, when conditions seem favourable — for instance the first warm spring day by a cold sea — it is a good idea to scan the horizon from positions at different heights. Here, one clue to the possible presence of mirages can be a dark stripe along the horizon, looking like a thin layer of pollution fog. If you see this, it is well worth experimenting with different viewing heights to look for good mirages; it may even be worth waiting around for them. The wind should be blowing at a few m/s from the warm land mass; should the wind be too strong, even 6-8 m/s, it tends to mix up the air layers. It is nevertheless also true that on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, a long-term current of warm air across the sea from Estonia may be just right for creating conditions which are conducive to mirages. Your chances of seeing superior mirages may, however, be further complicated by poor visibility; these mirages are usually visible out at sea affecting islands at a distance of about 15-30 kilometres, and at that distance, even a slight haze is enough to cloud the contrast and spoil the visibility of the mirage. Fortunately, warm spring air currents are often dry in Finland and thus offer good opportunities for looking for mirages. After all the trouble, it is usually well worth the effort when you actually see a mirage, which at best can distort the landscape in the most incredible way. If and when you come across this natural phenomenon, be grateful for the opportunity and make the most of the atmospheric optics!<p><p><p><p>In the context of mirages, we should not forget sunsets, because so many people watch them and therefore often witness the surprising tricks of the atmosphere — possibly even without ever realizing it. Even the setting sun is usually too bright to watch with the naked eye, so a piece of exposed film or the grey filter from a camera is useful. (At sunset, the film you use can even be a piece of exposed colour film, unlike when the sun is high in the sky, when only exposed black and white film is safe.) Unlike the conditions in daytime landscapes, the sunset is never spoilt by a slight haze. Furthermore, the sunlight passes twice through the entire atmosphere, so clear distortions are much more common than good superior mirages. The sun can be distorted in the most amazing ways: it splits up into slices; it looks almost square when it sets; the disc of the sun takes on the shape of a Chinese lantern; after it has actually set, the sun may sometimes float above the horizon as a needle-thin strip for 10-15 minutes before finally disappearing; the sun may have the shape of a pot, a peaked cap, a vase, a cauldron, an atom bomb… On the surface of the sun, dark sunspots may be vertically elongated into dark columns or double like ordinary mirages. At sunset it is possible to see anything! Some people may be familiar with one of Nature’s most exciting surprises: sometimes the very last ray of the setting sun is bright green, a pure, metallic shade of green which would be considered utterly mendacious if a painter dared to include it in his painting. Jules Verne has written an entire novel on the theme of this green flash (Le Rayon vert). It is said that whosoever sees it shall never be short of luck in love! Surely that alone is a good enough reason to go looking for mirages on the horizon?<p><p> <p><p>Text and photos by Pekka Parviainen, mathematics lecturer, University of Turku, December 2001<p><p>Shifting horizons and eerie ships<p><p>The refraction of light<p><p>The two paths of light<p><p>The inferior mirage<p><p>The superior mirage<p><p>Hunt for mirages with your binoculars<p><p>The green flash<p><p>Pekka Parviainen’s pictures of the sun in different shapes<p><p>A ship of many shapes<p><p>The two paths of light in a thermal inversion<p><p>Mirages require searching and waiting<p>", "time": "2014-04-07T12:47:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Is Finnish a difficult language? - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/is-finnish-a-difficult-language/", "review": "", "content": "<p>How easily can a foreigner learn a language like this? In fact, Finnish is a very logical language, as many students who have methodologically studied it admit.<p><p>Finnish often expresses ideas very differently from the ways of the more commonly studied European languages. In other words Finnish is different. But this does not make it more difficult than other languages. Linguists recognise a phenomenon called Sprachbund. This means that in a certain geographical area, languages which differ from each other typologically share other similarities which result from living in a similar environment. This kind of phenomenon exists, for example, in the Baltic region. Because of the same environment, a common history, culture and contacts, Scandinavian languages, German and Finnish share some features (perhaps mostly in vocabulary) which bind them together and accordingly make it easier for people who know these languages to understand some features of Finnish.<p><p>To start with, Finnish is a very demanding language, not least for a teacher and an author of a Finnish textbook. Why? Because Finnish is a very synthetic language. Both nouns and verbs have a large number of inflectional types, some of which are more frequent than others. Furthermore, as I have already mentioned, languages are never static. They change, and, therefore, it is often impossible to give a strict rule for a particular grammatical point. One example of this is the change ti &gt; si which started hundreds of years ago and is still continuing. Many native speakers might hesitate, for example, between the imperfect forms kielsi and kielti, meaning “he forbade”. <p><p>For these reasons, the problem facing the teacher of Finnish is to decide in which order grammar and vocabulary should be taught and how thoroughly they should be learnt. The answer to this depends on the aim of the language course. Is it just to learn a little conversational Finnish and to keep the students amused for two hours per week? Or is the learner going to be a translator or interpreter who has to understand all the nuances of the language?<p><p>To understand the kind of complexities that Finnish presents to the beginner, let us examine the Finnish equivalent of the simple English sentence: I like you. The English sentence is very easy for a foreigner to handle because you simply place one word after the other. This simple sentence translates into Finnish as Minä pidän sinusta.<p><p>Before you can produce this Finnish sentence, you have to know the following:<p><p>It is quite a lot of grammar to handle such a simple sentence. Of course, you can say Minä pitää sinä leaving all the words in their basic form, and surprisingly the Finns will understand you (provided your body language is appropriate). But if you are a perfectionist or otherwise take your studies seriously, you will want to know how a Finn says it.<p><p>However, that is only the start of the problem. In reality it is not very likely that a Finn today would say: Minä pidän sinusta. If a young Finnish man were bold enough to express such feelings in words, he would be more likely to say something like: Mä tykkään susta. This brings us to the reality that every language has a range of dialects and registers. Finnish has regional dialects and different social variants (jargons, slangs). Colloquial Finnish often differs markedly from the standard language. For a foreigner, however, it is always best to start with the standard form of the language.<p><p>This all brings me back to the question: Is Finnish a difficult language? As the reader might already have guessed, my usual reply to the question is: it is not difficult but different. The biggest problem is where to start. You want to learn but there seems to be no end to what you have to remember before you can form even the most simple statement. There are so many words which all seem to look the same but which have different meanings and functions.<p><p>But is Finnish more difficult than French or Spanish or Latin or German which you might have studied at school? Remember how you learnt (or failed to learn) French at school. How many years did you spend on it? How many classes did you have with teacher every week? How much home work did you have? What was your French like when you left the school? What is your French like now?<p><p>When people study Finnish abroad it is most often once a week for perhaps two hours at a time in an evening class. Most teachers give students some homework but many students do not do it. Students often believe, or expect, that a language can be learnt by osmosis – just like that, in the classroom. Unfortunately, the study of any foreign language requires work – and often very hard work. Finnish grammar can be learnt logically. The greatest obstacle is the vocabulary, which requires memory; and the teacher cannot memorise for you.<p><p> <p><p>By Hannele Branch, lecturer in Finnish, University of London<p>", "time": "2010-08-20T12:07:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Remove the membranes from the meat and dry it. Rub the surface of the meat with salt and roll it in the herb mixture. Press the herbs tightly into the meat to form a green covering. Wrap the fillet tightly into a roll in cling film, let it stand for 2−3 hours and then freeze it. Slice the frozen meat thinly with a slicer or a sharp knife and lay the slices in a circle thinly brushed with the vinaigrette. Sprinkle the vinaigrette lightly over the slices of meat. Set the frisee salad and cucumber bits in the middle of the dish and sprinkle the serving with gourmet salt and parmesan cheese. Drizzle a little herb oil around the edges of the serving dish.<p><p>ROSEMARY VINAIGRETTE<p><p>Mix the ingredients and let the mixture stand for about an hour.<p><p>HERB OIL<p><p>Chop the parsley, chervil and salt finely in a food processor. Drizzle the oil over them and continue processing until the oil is an even green colour. Season with the pepper and strain. You can store any surplus oil in the refrigerator for later use.<p><p>PICKLED CHANTERELLES<p><p>Vinegar solution:<p><p>Clean the chanterelles, parboil them for a minute and drain them. Measure the ingredients for the vinegar solution into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Slice the onion into rings and add them and the chanterelles to the boiling solution. Cook for 20 minutes. Remove the whole spices and pour the mushrooms with the brine into small, clean, heated jars. Cool. The chanterelles will keep for a long time when stored in a cold place.<p><p><p><p>(serves 6)<p><p>Warm the milk to 42 °C and add the yeast. Add the buckwheat flour and mix it to a smooth dough. Cover and allow it to stand overnight and ferment into sourdough. Combine the other ingredients with the sourdough, folding in the beaten egg whites last. Fry the blinis until crisp in clarified butter in a blini pan and serve them hot with clarified butter, vendance roe, chopped onion, black pepper and smetana.<p><p><p><p>(serves 8)<p><p>MARINADE<p><p>Cut the fish fillets into thin strips. Combine the marinade ingredients. Turn the strips of fish in the marinade ensuring that there is marinade between them. Let them marinate for at least 2 hours.<p><p>Cut the courgette lengthwise into thin slices with a cheese slicer. Steam the slices for a couple of minutes and chill them in iced water. Finally dry them carefully between sheets of kitchen roll.<p><p>Drain off excess marinade from the strips of fish and dice them. With the aid of a ring mould form the whitefish into tartare portions and wrap rings made of slices of courgette around them. Tie the rings in place with a strip of boiled leak. Serve on a bed of frisée salad, garnish with a shoot of mangold and drizzle herb oil around the serving.<p><p>HERB OIL<p><p>Chop the parsley, chervil and salt finely in a food processor. Drizzle the oil over them and continue processing until the oil is an even green colour. Season with the pepper and strain. You can store any surplus oil in the refrigerator for later use.<p><p><p><p>(serves 8)<p><p>SALAD<p><p>Clean the mushrooms, place them in a saucepan and sweat them dry. Strain them and allow them to drip completely dry through a sieve. Then sauté them golden brown in butter and season them with salt and black pepper.<p><p>Wash the lettuces and let them drip dry. Tear them up into a bowl and dress them with olive oil, salt and balsamic vinegar just prior to serving. Put the mixed salad in mounds on the plates and lay the mushrooms on them directly from the pan. Garnish with onion flowers, crown dill, dill sprigs or chopped dill.<p><p><p><p>(serves 6)<p><p>From the thicker part of the salmon fillet cut three pieces of approximately equal thickness, each about 20 cm long and 3−4 cm wide. Salt the pieces of salmon and set them aside for about an hour. Wipe off the salt and dry the salmon. Sear the pieces of salmon on all sides on a hot griddle pan, and when they are browned transfer them to an oven tray. Prepare the Sauternes sauce. Then cook the salmon in a 170°C oven for 5−7 minutes until the interior temperature of the fish is about 48 degrees. The fish can remain a little reddish in the middle.<p><p>Cut the pieces of salmon crosswise into two and slice the resulting halves again into two. Place the tower-like pieces of salmon in pairs on the plates and serve with the Sauternes sauce, boiled asparagus and green vegetables.<p><p>SAUTERNES SAUCE<p><p>Sweat the shallots in butter and let them stand for a while. Then add the wine and the fish stock. Reduce the sauce to 2.5 dl. Process the ingredients with a hand-held blender to an even consistency and mix in the butter. Froth the soup with the blender and taste for flavour. Add seasoning if necessary.<p><p><p><p>(serves 8)<p><p>MINCE<p><p>MUSHROOM STUFFING<p><p>If the zander fillets are thick, you can pound them gently flat. Lay them on the work surface skin side up and season them lightly with salt and white pepper.<p><p>Cut up the filleted zander for the stuffing, season it with salt and mince it in a food processor. Add the egg and continue mincing. Finally drizzle in the cream in a thin stream and season with white pepper.<p><p>Dice the mushrooms finely, sauté them in butter and drain them.<p><p>Spread the mince thinly over the skin side of the fillets of zander and then sprinkle the mushrooms on top. Press them lightly into the mince, and fold the fillets in two, turning the tails over towards the heads.<p><p>Grill the folded fillets either on a salted hotplate or a griddle plan. Transfer them to an oven dish, place a knob of butter on each and bake them in a 175°C oven for 10−12 minutes.<p><p>Serve with butter and wine sauce, halved tomatoes, mangetouts and sautéed portabella mushrooms seasoned with salt, white pepper and thyme.<p><p>BUTTER AND WINE SAUCE<p><p>Chop up the onion and sweat it for a few minutes in cooking oil. Add the wine and lemon juice and reduce the sauce by a half. Thicken slightly with the cornflour. Mix in the butter vigorously with a hand-held blender and strain the sauce. Do not boil it again.<p><p><p><p>(serves 6)<p><p>Detach the legs and breasts from the willow grouse. Remove any gristle, tenderise them lightly and season them with salt and pepper. Peel the apple and slice it. Reserve 6 rings and put the rest to boil with the sauce base. Sauté the breasts and the slices of apple quickly in butter and transfer them to an oven tray. Roast them for a couple of minutes at 200°C.<p><p>Assemble the servings as follows: at the bottom a bed of sautéed chanterelles, on that one breast, then an apple ring and on top the other breast. Garnish with decorative vegetables and drizzle a little of the sauce over the breasts and on the plate.<p><p>You can freeze the fillets and the legs and use them later, for example for a timbale.<p><p>SAUTÉED CHANTERELLES<p><p>Cut up the chanterelles coarsely and chop the onion. Sauté the chanterelles in butter for a few minutes and add the chopped onion.<p><p>SAUCE<p><p>Cut up the carcasses of the willow grouse. Brown them together with the chopped root vegetables in the oven or on a frying pan. Transfer them to a saucepan and add enough stock to cover them. Add the sauce mix and the bay leaf. Cook them for about 40 minutes, strain, and continue to reduce the liquid until the sauce base is sufficiently strong.<p><p>Taste for flavour, add seasoning if necessary and thicken with dark cornflour, blackcurrant jelly and a drop of cream. Add 1 tablespoonful of butter and froth the sauce with a hand-held blender.<p><p><p><p>(serves 6)<p><p>Remove the gristle from the fillets and season them with salt and pepper. Let them rest and prepare the sauce (see below).<p><p>Sauté the fillets quickly in butter. Continue frying until they turn pink in the middle or roast them for 4−5 minutes in the oven at 200°C. Allow them to rest under foil for 2−3 minutes. Slice them across the grain and set them on the plate. Serve with lingonberry sauce and fried shallots, baby courgettes and turnip rings. Garnish with a few lingonberries and herbs.<p><p>LINGONBERRY SAUCE<p><p>Sauté the gristle and the chopped root vegetables in a frying pan or saucepan. Add the sugar and continue frying until it dissolves. Add the lingonberries, stock, sauce mix and spices. Reduce by a half and strain. Add the cream and continue to reduce the liquid. Taste for flavour and add seasoning if necessary. Thicken the sauce with cornflour.<p><p><p><p>(serves 8)<p><p>STUFFING<p><p>TOPPING<p><p>Remove the gristle from the meat and slit it open into a steak. Tenderise it lightly and season with salt and pepper. Sweat the spinach rapidly in a drop of olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Cut the apricots into strips and grate the cheese coarsely.<p><p>Spread the spinach evenly all along the steak and then sprinkle the apricot strips and grated cheddar over it. Drizzle a stripe of balsamic syrup over the cheese and fold the slab of meat into a tight roll, binding it with twine in 5 or 6 places. Season the surface of the roll with mixed herbs and salt and allow it to rest at room temperature for about an hour.<p><p>Sear the meat in a frying pan and transfer it to a baking tray. Roast it for about 15 minutes at 225°C. Remove it from the oven and allow it to rest for a while. Cut the roll into slices about 3−4 cm thick.<p><p>For the topping, dice the toasted bread, the cheese (with the rind) and the butter into small cubes. Blend into a paste in a food processor and roll between cling film into a sheet about 0.5 cm thick. Chill briefly in the freezer. Cut out disks the size of the fillet roll (about 7 cm in diameter) from the paste and return them to the freezer for a while. Place the topping disks on the fillet rolls and gratinate them quickly at a high temperature under the grill in the upper part of the oven.<p><p>Serve with elk sauce, sculpted sweet potatoes, fried slices of portabella mushroom and boiled baby fenugreeks.<p><p>ELK SAUCE<p><p>Sauté the chopped onion, carrot and celery, add the stock and reduce. Add the juices from the roast meat. Strain the sauce and taste for flavour. Add seasoning if necessary. Also thicken with cornflour if necessary.<p><p><p><p>(serves 6-8)<p><p>CLOUDBERRY SAUCE<p><p>Pass the cloudberries through a fine sieve or use a hand-held blender to process them into a smooth sauce. Mix in the sugar and thin the syryp to a suitable consistency with the cloudberry liqueur to make 2 dl of sauce.<p><p>Separate the egg white from the yolk, and beat the yolk together with the sugar into a froth. Whip the cream and beat the egg white into a froth. Fold half of the cloudberry syrup into the creamed egg yolk. Soak the gelatine, squeeze it dry, dissolve it in boiling water and add it to the creamed egg yolk. Then gently fold in the whipped cream and beaten egg white. Allow the mixture to set in the refrigerator for about 3 hours. Pipe the mixture into cylinders made from tuille pastry and garnish with cloudberry sauce and fresh cloudberries.<p><p>TUILLE PASTRY CYLINDERS<p><p>Cream the egg white and the icing sugar. Fold in the flour. Add the melted butter and mix to an even dough. Cover the dough and place it in the refrigerator for about half an hour. Heat the oven to 200 °C and either grease two oven trays or use silicon pastry mats. Use a mould to cut the pastry into the desired shape to make the cylinders and bake them in the oven for 5-8 minutes until the biscuits take on an attractive colour. Use a spatula to lift off the biscuits carefully and bend them into cylinders while still hot.<p><p>This will make about 15 biscuits depending their shape and size.<p><p>The dough will keep in a refrigerator for 3-4 days.<p><p><p><p>(serves 6)<p><p>Place 1 dl of slightly frozen redcurrants in each bowl or dish and pour hot butterscotch sauce over them. Serve immediately.<p><p>Alternatively you can roll the redcurrants in icing sugar twice, re-freezing them between the sugarings. Serve with the butterscotch sauce in a separate jug.<p><p>BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE<p><p>Cook the mixture on low heat for 1-1 ½ hours until the sauce is golden brown.<p><p><p><p>(serves 6)<p><p>Blend the egg yolks, sugar and cream in a bowl and whip the mixture in a bain-marie until it reaches a temperature of 82 °C. Cool the bowl in iced water.<p><p>Blend the sugar with the wild strawberries in a food processor. Add ¾ of the mixture and the vodka to the ice cream mixture and make it into ice cream in an ice cream maker. Add a little sugar to the remaining strawberry mixture and thin it with strawberry liqueur to form a sauce. Garnish the ice cream portions with whole wild strawberries and strawberry sauce.<p><p><p><p>(serves 8)<p><p>Soak the sheets of gelatine in cold water for about 10 minutes. Squeeze them dry. Heat the milk. Place the egg and the soaked gelatine on the bottom of a bowl and pour the hot milk over them, stirring continuously. Then add the essence and finally fold in the whipped cream.<p><p>Pour the mixture into a loose-based baking tin to a depth of about 3 cm. When it has set, pour a thin layer of the sea buckthorn jelly (made with sea buckthorn essence and 1 sheet of gelatine) over it.<p><p>When the jelly too has set, carefully remove the sides of the baking tin and cut round serving portions with a ring mould. Lay a chocolate basket hood partly over each serving and garnish it with drizzled sea buckthorn syrup, halved sea buckthorn berries and a sprig of melissa. You can also use edible violets to give the servings a final garnish.<p><p>SEA BUCKTHORN ESSENCE<p><p>Reduce the sea buckthorn juice and the sugar gently for about 10 minutes until there is 2 dl left. Use half of the essence for the pudding and the other half for the jelly.<p><p>SEA BUCKTHORN SYRUP<p><p>Boil the ingredients at 104°C into a syrup.<p><p>CHOCOLATE BASKET HOODS (8 pieces)<p><p>Melt the chocolate in a bain-marie, or use the melting program in your micro-wave oven. If using a bain-marie, ensure that the water does not come into contact with the chocolate.<p><p>Crush ice finely in a food processor and pack it into an individual serving bowl. Then turn out the ice onto the work surface. Pipe the melted chocolate in a thin stream over the heap of crushed ice in a cross-hatch pattern and allow the chocolate to set. Lift the chocolate basket carefully off the ice and place it upright. You have time to make several baskets before the ice melts.<p><p><p><p>(serves 8−10)<p><p>FILLING<p><p>Measure all the ingredients apart from the whipped cream into a saucepan.

However, that’s not the case with Finnish.<p><p>Finns often run into questions like “Is Finnish like Swedish?” or “Does everyone in Finland speak Russian?” A simple answer to both questions is no. Both Swedish (one of the two official languages of Finland) and Russian belong to the Indo-European group of languages, while Finnish is a Finno-Ugric language. The latter group also includes Hungarian, Estonian, Sámi (spoken by the indigenous people of northern Finland, Sweden and Norway and northwestern Russia) and several lesser-known languages spoken in areas of Russia. The Finno-Ugric languages share enough common lexical and grammatical features to prove a common origin. Although these languages have developed separately for thousands of years, it can be seen that common features include:<p><p>1) absence of gender (the same Finnish pronoun, “hän,” denotes both “he” and “she”) 2) absence of articles (a and the in English) 3) long words due to the structure of the language 4) numerous grammatical cases 5) personal possession expressed with suffixes 6) postpositions in addition to prepositions 7) no equivalent of the verb “to have”<p><p>There are various speculative theories about the time and place of the origin of the so-called Proto-Finno-Ugrian language. According to the most common theory, Hungarian and Finnish are separated by a mere 6,000 years of separate development.<p><p>How long Finnish-speakers have populated Finland is a question that has always interested Finnish scholars. Nowadays it is thought that speakers of a Finno-Ugric language have been living in the area of present-day Finland since at least 3000 BC. During the following millennia contacts proliferated between the speakers of the Finno-Ugric language and speakers of neighbouring Indo-European languages (e.g. Baltic, Germanic and Slavic dialects). Numerous loan words borrowed by Finnish, Estonian and the other Baltic Finnic languages (Karelian, Lude, Vepsian, Vote and Livonian) demonstrate the existence of contacts between the people speaking Finnic languages and people speaking Indo-European languages. Not only vocabulary has been borrowed, but also many grammatical features. Most loans in present-day Finnish have come from the Germanic and Scandinavian languages, especially from Swedish.<p><p> <p><p>By Hannele Branch, lecturer in Finnish, University of London<p>", "time": "2014-11-19T12:13:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Success of Finnish schoolchildren indicates society's values - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/success-of-finnish-schoolchildren-indicates-societys-values/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In 2007 Finnish schoolchildren again ranked first in the international PISA survey, which measures the learning results of 15-year-olds. What kind of school produces these top results? What factors lie behind the success? We interviewed Aki Holopainen, Headmaster of Munkkiniemi School in Helsinki.<p><p>Mr Holopainen is not surprised by the results of the PISA survey. He points out, however, that the conclusions to be drawn from the results do not apply merely to the school system.<p><p>“A school is not a separate island of excellence — and there is a lot of room for improvement in schools too. In my opinion, the results of the survey are rather an indication of the values and potential of society.<p><p>Children and adolescents grow up in an environment where education is highly valued across the board and where there is a high level of preparedness to do work. The value base is never questioned, there is generally a good, non-disruptive atmosphere in which to work, and there is a practical approach in all things,” says Holopainen, listing factors behind the success of Finnish schools.<p><p>Holopainen is in charge of one of the biggest schools in Helsinki, with some 950 pupils and 70 teachers. The School has some 400 pupils studying in the 7th to 9th grades, which is compulsory, and 450 upper secondary school pupils.<p><p>The upper secondary school is classless, in other words pupils complete courses at their own pace, the average time being three years. The school is situated in the west of Helsinki, in the middle-class suburb of Munkkiniemi. The oldest section of the school building dates back to 1951, and it was last renovated and extended in 2000. The building is pleasant and well-equipped, including a sports hall and seating area of more 900 m2, an assembly hall seating 700, a library with 23,000 volumes and the latest in information and teaching technology apparatus.<p><p>Munkkiniemi School has a library with 23,000 volumes.Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>Munkkiniemi School is a privately owned, but as far as the pupils are concerned there is hardly any difference between it and municipal schools. Tuition is free of charge at all levels in the school, the costs being covered mainly by central and local government grants.<p><p>Being a private school means being administratively autonomous, but teachers’ salaries and the school’s disposable funds are largely equal to those of municipal schools.<p><p>All the children living in the catchment area are guaranteed a place in the school, and other Helsinki children can be admitted by application if there are places available. Admission to the upper secondary school depends on the average of the grades on the comprehensive school leaving certificate, and students can apply from anywhere in Finland.<p><p>In Finnish schools, the grade scale ranges from 4 (fail) to 10 (excellent), and in order to get a place at Munkkiniemi School, a student must have a minimum grade average of about 8.2 to 8.3.<p><p>“We’re a good school, but we’re not right at the top. This means that our pupils include quite ordinary boys too, not just high-achieving girls. About half of those who complete their minimum compulsory education at this school progress into our upper secondary stage,” Holopainen says.<p><p>Munkkiniemi School has its own curriculum, which is based on the national curriculum. The national curriculum sets the compulsory subjects, the number of hours to be allocated to them and the contents to be taught. It is up to the school and the teachers to decide how the subjects will be taught.<p><p>“The national curriculum is clearly-stated and extensive and by following it we ensure that pupils and students are left with no skill gaps. It also guarantees a uniform level of study and goals so that no major differences are created by school or by area. This must be one factor that explains the consistently high level of success that Finland reaches in the PISA tests,” Holopainen states.<p><p>In the upper level of the comprehensive school, every pupil studies the core subjects, namely mathematics, one foreign language and the other official language (Swedish or Finnish depending on their mother tongue), natural sciences, history, social studies, religion or ethics, health education, music, arts and crafts, home economics, and physical education.<p><p>According to teachers young people know how to react with healthy common sense to what is published on the internet.Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>The pupils also choose optional subjects. At Munkkiniemi School, there is a diverse array of electives on offer, thanks to the diversity of teaching staff: drama, basketball, home economics, art, technical work, textile work, physical exercise, media education, music, information technology, French and German.<p><p>Upper secondary school has mainly the same compulsory subjects as the upper level of comprehensive school, with the addition of economics, law, psychology and philosophy. Munkkiniemi School specializes in extended mathematics courses, which start in comprehensive school and continue in upper secondary school.<p><p>The course programme in upper secondary school classes includes university-level mathematics courses. If they so wish, the upper secondary school pupils can also study applied skills courses. “The high educational level, motivation and commitment of the teachers are important factors. They genuinely pursue the pupils’ best interests and also integrate those who need special support.”<p><p>Why then do Finnish schoolchildren do so well in natural sciences? “The natural science curriculum contains an enormous amount of material, and to help assimilate it, we appeal to all the senses and use practical exercises. A wide range of laboratory and field work keeps up interest and motivation,” replies Tiina Virkki, who teaches geography and biology.<p><p>“I also think it is important for subjects taught to be always connected to the society outside school. In biology and geography, for example, we achieve this via extramural ecological issues that will become increasingly important,” Virkki continues.<p><p>Munkkiniemi School participates in the Green Flag project that is part of the international Eco-Schools programme in which an entire school community endeavours to reduce environmental loading caused by the school.<p><p>From time to time, the media ask how things are going in Finnish schools. Are top-level learning results achieved at the expense of increasing stress and mental ailments? This question was last put to the public at the beginning of November 2007 in connection with the shooting at Jokela School.<p><p>“In my opinion, things are going well, generally speaking. In fact, I think that for most young people things are going better than ever, but there is some polarization here. Some suffer from exclusion, and their situation can be difficult,” Holopainen remarks.<p><p>Aki Holopainen, Headmaster of Munkkiniemi School in Helsinki.<p><p>He feels the Jokela shooting was the act of a sick individual and does not see it as a symptom of a wider problem. Surveys conducted in Finnish schools have occasionally revealed that Finnish children do not enjoy school as much as children in many other European countries.<p><p>This Holopainen puts down partly to cultural factors: when a Finn is asked ‘how are you?’, the reply is not automatically ‘fine, thanks’, but an honest description of his or her health at the time. In many countries, it would be bad manners or even provocative to talk about dissatisfaction or a community’s faults. Nor does Holopainen believe that the problems have increased, just that they have never been talked about so openly.<p><p>“When we plan the schoolwork, we take into account the situation of individual pupils and make sure that not too many tests and projects are piled on to them at the same time. At our school we have a school social worker, a psychologist, a pupil counsellor and a pupil welfare team who look after the wellbeing of the pupils both pre-emptively and when someone starts to show symptoms. In my opinion, this system works,” Holopainen states.<p><p>Primary responsibility for children lies, of course, with the parents, but the adults in a school community are an important support for young people. Many foreign visitors to Finnish schools remark on the friendly relationship between teachers and pupils. The pupils are on familiar terms with their teachers and address them by their first names, and they chat informally in the classrooms and corridors.<p><p>“Finnish young people are smart, society-oriented, gregarious and family-centered. Parents are interested in their schooling and support it; cooperation with families is good. As I see it, our schools are producing young people who are not only capable but also mentally strong and well-balanced and who have a lot to offer the world,” Aki Holopainen sums up.<p><p>By Salla Korpela, February 2008<p><p>Top-level schooling for all children in the immediate area<p><p>Comprehensive curriculum guarantees good knowledge and skills<p><p>How are things going at school?<p>", "time": "2009-06-24T08:15:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Environmental protection in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/environmental-protection-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finland provides many good examples of how to protect the natural environment. Wide-ranging and detailed environmental data and high levels of technological skill form the basis of Finland’s effective environmental protection policies. As one of the world’s wealthiest industrialised countries Finland is also able to afford vital environmental investments. Finland’s low population density and comparatively unspoilt natural environment also facilitate nature conservation.<p><p>The fruits of successful environmental policies are clearly visible around the country. Many polluted lakes and rivers have been cleaned up. Air quality has improved greatly around industrial locations. An extensive network of protected areas has been built up to safeguard biodiversity. Forests – Finland’s most valuable natural resources – are managed more sensitively than in the past, and the overall annual growth rate clearly exceeds the total timber harvest.<p><p>Emissions from large industrial facilities have particularly been curbed significantly. There has also been progress in controlling emissions from agriculture, transport and homes, although these trends have not been as favourable as for industry. There is still a need to reduce airborne emissions of carbon dioxide, noise and particles from traffic, as well as waterborne nutrient emissions generated by farms and by scattered settlements not connected to sewerage systems.<p><p>Efforts to halt the ongoing decline in biodiversity have also been insufficient in spite of progress in the conservation of certain threatened species. The struggle to combat climate change must also be continued more resolutely both in Finland and globally. But the successful reduction of acidification problems shows that well-planned strategic environmental policies can achieve their goals.<p><p>The main aim of environmental protection is to anticipate risks and prevent damage before any harm is done. It is especially vital to be aware of critical ecological thresholds in cold northern environments, where nature can be slow to recover from any damage.<p><p>The vegetation of Finnish Lapland is especially sensitive to disturbances such as logging and overgrazing by domesticated reindeer. Fortunately these threats have been reduced through the protection of large areas of forest and restrictions on the number of reindeer. Increasing tourism in Lapland can likewise burden the environment, but it can also encourage environmental protection, since most tourists are attracted to Lapland by the region’s unspoilt natural settings.<p><p>Tourism in Lappland can burden the environment but it can also encourage environmental protection, since tourists are attracted to Lapland by the unspoilt nature.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board/Pekka Luukkola<p><p>Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>It is much harder and more expensive to repair any damage done to the environment than to prevent harm in the first place. In the worst cases damage may even be irreparable. Arctic climatic conditions may inhibit the natural regeneration of logged forests in northern Lapland. On the other hand, the predicted warming of the climate could completely wipe out species and whole ecosystems adapted to cold conditions.<p><p>Climate change and the consequent reduction in snow and ice cover could prove to be fateful for animals such as the Saimaa ringed seal, since these rare lake seals raise their young in winter dens dug in compact snowdrifts on the frozen waters of the Saimaa lake system in eastern Finland. Thanks to the efforts of conservationists, seal numbers have risen slowly since the 1980s, but there are still fewer than 300 seals, and their population increase seems to be slowing. Saimaa ringed seals used to face problems including persecution by fishermen and contamination with mercury and other toxic chemicals. Controls over fishing have thankfully reduced the numbers of young seals killed in fishing nets or traps, but seals are increasingly suffering due to the disturbance of their habitat by snowmobile traffic in the winter, and the construction of lakeside holiday homes.<p><p>Across 80% of Finland’s lacustrine area the water is rated excellent or good. Water near industrial sites has improved but Finland’s inland waters are shallow and vulnerable and thus still need care.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Many environmental problems can be lessened if sufficient time and money can be found to address them. But it could take decades to resolve the problem of eutrophication in Finland’s inland waters and the Baltic Sea, for instance. Over time some waters could recover from the presence of excess nutrients through natural processes, if further inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen could be kept down to acceptable levels. But there are at least 1,500 lakes around Finland where more active ecological restoration measures such as selective fishing, oxygenation or the removal of aquatic vegetation would be needed to combat eutrophication effectively. Such measures have already been applied in almost a thousand lakes.<p><p>Eutrophication is an example of a gradual environmental change that can suddenly attract the attention of the public when a certain threshold is exceeded. In Finland eutrophication first became the focus of extensive debate in the summer of 1997, when massive algal blooms occurred widely in the Gulf of Finland. Blue-green algae occur naturally in Finnish waters, but such massive blooms are a clearly visible consequence of decades of excessive nutrient loads.<p><p>Water quality is classified as excellent or good across 80% of the total area of Finland’s lakes. Waters near industrial facilities have particularly become cleaner in recent years. But Finland’s small and shallow bodies of water are sensitive to pollution, and environmental protection must still be further enhanced.<p><p>Finland has been rated among the world’s leading countries in many international comparisons of environmental protection standards, such as the Global Economic Forum’s regularly compiled Environmental Sustainability Index. Finland’s strengths include highly effective environmental administration and legislation, and the ways environmental protection is considered in all sectors of society.<p><p>But not all comparisons are so flattering. Signs of the need for improvement include Finland’s large ecological footprint, high levels of material and energy consumption, and excessive greenhouse gas emissions.<p><p>The WWF assesses the environmental impacts of societies or individuals through indicators known as ecological footprints, which show how much biologically productive space would be needed to meet our levels of consumption and deal with the wastes and emissions we generate. A recent comparative study revealed Finland’s natural resource consumption rates per capita to be the third highest in the world.<p><p>Finland is Europe’s most forested country, with more than 70% of the land covered with forests. About 17,000 km2 of forest is strictly protected. Finland’s forest resources are increasing as the natural growth of forests more than compensates for the amounts of timber logged.Photo: Ponsse<p><p>According to the WWF, the average Finnish citizen has an ecological footprint of about 7.6 global hectares. This footprint is more than three times larger than the global average. Finland does have more than 12 global hectares of biologically productive areas per head of population, however, which is much higher figure than the national consumption rate. This figure is so high due to Finland’s extensive areas of sparsely populated forest.<p><p>The environmental loads produced by Finns are also large in absolute terms. When all the natural resources used in Finland are added up to give the country’s Total Material Requirement (TMR), it becomes evident that each person consumes an average of about 100 tonnes of resources every year. This figure includes the hidden material flows that lie behind the production of all goods and services. These figures are high due to Finland’s high standard of living, large-scale intensive metal and forest industries, and the high demand for energy due to the cold climate and long distances.<p><p>Enhancing the efficiency of the use of materials is one of the main goals of today’s environmental policies. The concept of eco-efficiency is used to promote such improvements, with the idea being to produce more commodities and well-being using the same amounts of resources. Initiatives designed to increase eco-efficiency include a wide-ranging national programme to promote sustainable consumption and production launched in 2005. This programme includes more than 70 measures designed to save energy and natural resources. Such goals can only be reached through the active involvement of all sectors of society.<p><p>Some experts fear that the state of the Baltic Sea has deteriorated so much that it might never be able to revert to its natural condition. The Baltic is a shallow sea, and has only a slow exchange of water with the open seas. In its catchment area live 5.2 million Finns and some 80 million other people and much of the pollution from their homes, workplaces, farms and ships ends up in the sea. Symptoms of the Baltic’s serious ecological problems include mass algal blooms, declining fish stocks and extensive lifeless areas on the sea bed.<p><p>The depletion of vital oxygen from large areas of the seafloor is a consequence of the high inputs of nutrients entering the Baltic. Oxygen is used up when algae and other organic matter sink to the sea bed and decompose. In the absence of oxygen, large quantities of phosphorus can be released from seafloor sediments into the water. This internal nutrient loading can prolong the eutrophication process even where new inputs of nutrients from the land are kept under control.<p><p>The bottom waters of the Baltic are only replaced effectively when an occasional major pulse of heavy salty water from the North Sea flows in along the sea bed through the Danish Straits. In recent decades such pulses have been increasingly rare. It is not yet known whether this is a natural variation, or the impact of climate change on sea currents.<p><p>The waters of the Gulf of Finland near Helsinki are much cleaner than they used to be, thanks to successful environmental protection work. But to improve the state of the whole Gulf, measures need to be taken in Russia and Estonia as well as Finland.Photo: Martti Lintunen<p><p>Nutrient emissions from Finland’s coastal towns and fish farms into the Baltic have declined significantly. Finland has also contributed to improvements in wastewater treatment in the Russian city of St Petersburg, which represents the largest single source of nutrient loads entering the Gulf of Finland. Cleaning up St Petersburg’s wastewater is the fastest way to improve the state of the Gulf.<p><p>The condition of the Baltic Sea has long worried citizens and politicians from all the countries around its shores. One of the first ever international environmental agreements, the Helsinki Convention on the protection of the Baltic marine environment was signed by the coastal states in 1974. The Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) was set up to co-ordinate both the implementation of the convention and related improvements in environmental protection around the Baltic Sea.<p><p>Thanks to national and international actions, the amounts of toxic chemicals entering the Baltic Sea have been radically reduced. Many of the coastal states have also curbed nutrient inputs. More than half of the worst pollution sources around the Baltic have already been successfully addressed, enabling them to be removed from HELCOM’s Hot Spots List. Only one of the originally listed ten Finnish hot spots remains: farmland in southwest Finland bordering the Archipelago Sea.<p><p>By international standards Finland’s cities are small and blessed with many green areas. Most have only grown recently and are still developing rapidly. Until the mid 20th century Finland was still largely a rural society. Large-scale industrialisation only commenced after the Second World War. The new demand for an industrial labour force and the mechanisation of agriculture led to rapid urbanisation, especially from the 1960s onwards. Migration trends in recent years have involved the movement of people from smaller towns to a handful of larger urban centres.<p><p>This migration and rapid construction have resulted in more spatially scattered suburban communities, especially on the fringes of larger cities. This trend is problematic in environmental terms, as it leads to increases in traffic, energy consumption and the use of natural resources. It is difficult to organise effective public transportation systems where homes, services and workplaces are scattered over large areas. Planners nowadays endeavour to locate new buildings in existing built-up areas near the necessary infrastructure. Well-planned urban developments can still leave enough room for green areas and nature.<p><p>Air pollution and other environmental problems associated with cities around the world are comparatively slight in Finland’s urban centres. The most serious health problems concern particle emissions and noise. More than 800,000 Finns live in surroundings where they are subjected to noise levels of more than 55 decibels. Road traffic is the main source of this acoustic pollution , which can be difficult to reduce since residential areas are necessarily located near road links.<p><p>Airborne particle emissions reduce urban air quality in Finland particularly in the springtime, when the dry air can contain high concentrations of particles eroded from roads by the studded winter tyres of vehicles and the grit spread on roads through the winter to prevent skidding. This problem is serious enough to provoke widespread public concern. Particles emitted from domestic heating systems are also a health risk, especially in areas where many homes are heated with firewood.<p><p>Global climate change is expected to have extremely dramatic effects in Finland. Finnish experts have estimated that mean annual temperatures could rise by 2–7oC by 2080, while annual precipitation could increase by 5–40%. The winters could become largely snow-free in southern Finland, whilst in the north more snow may fall than previously.<p><p>Climate change could mean largely snow-free winters in southern Finland, whilst in the north more snow may fall than previously.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board/Hannu Hautala<p><p>Finland’s contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions are small in absolute terms, but very high when measured per capita. It is proving to be very difficult to reduce emissions to their 1990 level, which has been set as Finland’s target under the UN Kyoto Protocol. Emission levels in recent years have clearly exceeded this target, except during a couple of years with exceptional conditions.<p><p>Finland’s northerly location increases the demand for energy and natural resources, but the cold climate has also forced people to make sure that they produce and use energy efficiently, and insulate their homes well. Finland is one of the world’s leading countries in co-generation, the production of combined heat and power (CHP), by which the same power plant produces both electricity for the local grid, and heat to warm buildings and run industrial processes, a system known as district heating. This makes good use of heat energy that would be wasted in facilities only generating electricity.<p><p>Renewable energy sources account for about a quarter of all the energy used in Finland – a very high proportion by international standards. A large part of this renewable energy is produced from residuals generated in the pulp and paper industry, including bio-sludge and wood chips. Almost half of the wood used in Finland is burnt to produce energy.<p><p>Chart of energy sources in Finland 1996-2006.<p><p>About 50 per cent of Finland’s energy is produced by burning oil, gas or coal. Nuclear power accounts for 16% of the country’s energy, and peat about 5%. The share of nuclear energy will rise in a few years when Finland’s fifth nuclear reactor comes into operation.<p><p>Finland’s energy policies aim to significantly increase the use of renewable energy sources. So far wind power, solar power and geothermal or ground source heat are only exploited on a very small scale, but the number of Finnish buildings warmed using ground source heat is increasing rapidly. The greatest challenge for Finland is to find ways to save energy more effectively.<p><p>Measures taken to combat acidification represent one of the most significant successes in the field of environmental protection. Purposeful policies followed at national and international level have had the desired effects. Finland’s soils are naturally vulnerable to acidification, since they only contain low concentrations of calcium to buffer the acidifying effects of sulphur and nitrogen compounds deposited in the soils from airborne pollution. Farmland soils in Finland have to be regularly limed due to their natural acidity.<p><p>Thanks to various international environmental agreements and the development of cleaner fuels and emission cleaning technologies, acidifying emissions have declined steeply around Europe. And the collapse of the Soviet Union reduced airborne acidifying emissions from beyond Finland’s eastern border. Finland’s own atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen emissions are today just 25% and 60% of their levels in 1990.<p><p>Chart of acidifying emissions in Finland.<p><p>Acidification is harmful to many plants, but especially aquatic species. The forests and inland waters of northern Finland are particularly vulnerable, since their buffering capacity is naturally weak. Habitats in southern Finland are generally more resistant to acidification.<p><p>The harmful impacts of acidifying compounds can be expressed in terms of critical loads, which are the highest concentrations of impurities that an ecosystem can withstand without significant damage. If this critical load is exceeded, the entire functioning of an ecosystem can be endangered. According to such indicators the threat of acidification generally seems to be receding in Finland.<p><p>Unnatural concentrations of toxic chemicals in the environment have given rise to public concern, but their levels in Finland do not currently represent a serious health risk. Emissions of the most hazardous substances have been significantly reduced. Annual atmospheric emissions of lead, for instance, have declined from more than 1,000 tonnes in the early 1980s to just 20 tonnes today. Finland does not suffer from large quantities of airborne toxic pollution originating from other countries.<p><p>Finland’s winters are too cold for many crop pests to survive, so farmers do not need to use as many pesticides as their counterparts further south. But in such harsh conditions even small quantities of hazardous substances can be fateful for sensitive ecosystems and the cold climate can slow the natural degradation of toxic substances.<p><p>Only a few chemicals have been studied in enough detail for comprehensive evaluations of their environmental impacts to be possible. The EU’s REACH Regulation system (for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) aims to improve the management of risks related to chemicals. A key element of this system will be a database maintained by the new European Chemicals Agency, located in Helsinki. The database will include a register of all substances manufactured or imported by EU countries in quantities of more than one tonne. It has been estimated that the system will cover some 30,000 chemicals.<p><p>It is important to have comprehensive information about the properties of different chemicals, to ensure that action is taken to prevent releases of the more harmful chemicals into the natural environment. Preventive measures are vital, since many hazardous substances persist in the environment indefinitely, or only degrade slowly. Chemicals contaminating soils can still cause problems decades after the pollution occurs. In Finland there are estimated to be approximately 20,000 sites potentially suffering from soil contamination. Efforts to remediate such sites intensified in the late 1990s, and more recently clean-up work has been initiated at several hundred sites annually.<p><p>Finland’s biodiversity is exceptionally well documented, thanks to high quality research and the work of many keen amateur naturalists. On the other hand, Finland’s natural habitats contain fewer species than other habitats such as tropical rainforests. It is estimated that some 42,000 species occur naturally in the wild in Finland but in spite of the dedicated work of researchers, sufficient information is only available for the conservation statuses of about 15,000 of these species to be evaluated. About a tenth of these evaluated species have been classified as threatened. Some 200 species have provenly become extinct in Finland.<p><p>Finland and the other EU countries officially aim to halt the ongoing decline in biodiversity by 2010, but this goal is unlikely to be achieved. The number of threatened species in Finland is expected to grow by about 10% by 2010.<p><p>Most of Finland’s threatened species are associated with forest and farmland habitats. Forest species are threatened by logging and the shortage of decaying wood in commercially managed forests, and by the fragmentation of the remaining natural forests. Meanwhile, due to the intensification of agriculture, small-scale ecologically diverse habitats created by traditional farming practices have almost disappeared from the Finnish countryside. The spread of building developments along shorelines also reduces biodiversity.<p><p>The number of Finland’s large carnivores, bear, lynx, wolf and wolverine, has increased in recent years.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board/Eero Kemilä<p><p>Finland’s national bird, the whooper swan, has also become more widespread since the end of the 1950s.Photo: Finnish Tourist Board<p><p>Finland has achieved notable nature conservation successes in recent years, particularly in the cases of some larger animals and birds that were formerly hunted or harassed. Finland’s national bird, the whooper swan, for instance, has become much more widespread in recent decades.<p><p>The growing numbers of Finland’s four large carnivores – bear, lynx, wolf and wolverine – have provoked widespread public debate. These predators are feared in rural areas, even though exceptional permits have always been readily granted for the hunting of individual animals considered to be dangerous. There has been less controversy about increasing numbers of golden and white-tailed eagles.<p><p>Invasive species are one of the greatest threats to biodiversity around the world. The rapid spread of exotic species can seriously disrupt native ecosystems. So far only a few such species have created problems in Finland. The cold climate offers some protection, as many invaders fail to survive the northern winter. Biodiversity in Finland could be faced by many more problems with invasive species if the climate becomes warmer.<p><p> <p><p>Jari Lyytimäki, M.Sc., researcher, Finnish Environment Institute, July 2007, updated July 2014<p><p>Sensitive northern environments<p><p>Finnish track record<p><p>The Baltic Sea – permanently ill?<p><p>Green and spacious cities<p><p>Climate change and energy<p><p>Threat of acidification receding<p><p>Toxic chemicals<p><p>Biodiversity in Finland<p>", "time": "2014-06-04T12:59:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

{"title": "Tracing Finland's eastern border - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/tracing-finlands-eastern-border/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The Finnish-Russian border has been redrawn many times during the past.<p><p>Finland’s eastern border was drawn for the first time between Sweden and Novgorod in 1323 in the Treaty of Nöteborg. It cut through the present Finnish territory from northwest to southeast, from Pyhäjoki in northern Ostrobothnia to the Karelian Isthmus. The areas to the south and west of the border, including Vyborg, belonged to Sweden, while the areas north and east of the border, including the northern parts of Finland, were Russian territory. For centuries, the border drawn in the Treaty would separate two cultures, religions and languages, and its impacts are still felt today. Finnish dialects can be roughly classified into eastern and western variants in accordance with this ancient divide.<p><p>Resurgent Sweden and Russia clashed a number of times during the ensuing centuries and most of the battles were fought on Finnish soil. The Treaty of Teusina, concluded in 1595, ended a bloody guerrilla war between the two countries (known as the Long Wrath) that had been raging for 25 years. Under the Treaty, the northern section of Finland’s eastern border made a great leap eastwards, reaching the Arctic Ocean. Those drawing the new border recognised the fact that Finnish tribes had already spread towards the east. The next redrawing came two decades later. Russia had been weakened by succession disputes and Sweden managed to occupy large areas of Russia located to the southeast of Finland, which were ceded to it in the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617. As a result of its territorial gains, Sweden became one of the largest countries in Europe. For Karelians living in the areas now under Swedish rule, the redrawing of the border meant major changes. Sweden started to convert members of the Orthodox Church to the Protestant faith and imposed heavy taxes on them. As a result, a large number of Karelians moved to Russia and the westernmost Finnish tribes started settling in the areas conquered by Sweden.<p><p>Some one hundred years later, in a war known as the Great Wrath, Tsar Peter the Great reconquered the areas Russia had ceded to Sweden in the 17th century. Under the Treaty of Uusikaupunki, which brought the conflict to a close, Finland’s eastern border was moved to more or less where it is today. Two decades later, Russians invaded Finland again. The occupation, known as the Little Wrath, ended with the Treaty of Turku under which the areas east of the Kymijoki River and those around Savonlinna were ceded to Russia.<p><p>Finland’s eastern border 1323 – 1947.Map: The Karelian Association<p><p>Under the Treaty of Hamina in 1809, which ended the war between Sweden and Russia fought in 1808-1809, Finland was incorporated into Russia. Finland was granted autonomy, its pre-war administrative bodies remained in place, Protestantism remained the country’s religion, and the laws passed under the Swedish rule remained in force. In 1812, the parts of Karelia around Vyborg and to the north of Lake Ladoga were incorporated into the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. As a result, Finland’s eastern border now followed the course laid down in the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617.<p><p> <p><p>Finland declared itself independent in December 1917. A state of war existed between Finland and Soviet Russia even though no major battles were fought. Russia recognised Finland’s independence and concluded a peace treaty with its northwestern neighbour. Under the treaty, signed in the Estonian town of Tartu in 1920, the northern area of Petsamo was incorporated into Finland, while Finland ceded the Karelian districts of Repola and Porajärvi to Russia.<p><p>Finland’s eastern border was redrawn for the last time during the Second World War following conflicts between Finland and the Soviet Union. Under an interim peace treaty in 1944, Finland again had to cede to the Soviet Union the areas around Vyborg and to the north of Lake Ladoga, the Petsamo area, and parts of the northern municipalities of Salla and Kuusamo.

The 2006 PISA study emphasized science, in which Finnish fifteen-year-olds scored the highest by a wide margin ahead of — Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. Finland’s score of 563 points was also the highest total ever recorded in a PISA study. In reading comprehension, Finland ranked second after Korea, and in mathematics Finland also ranked second, losing out to China by only one point. The Finnish scores in these areas were 50 to 60 points higher than the OECD average, which is about 500.<p><p>Published in December 2007, the PISA study involved 389,750 randomly chosen 15-year-old pupils in 57 countries. The Finnish sample consisted of 4,714 students at 155 schools, of which 144 were Finnish-speaking and 11 Swedish-speaking.<p><p>The study demonstrates that the particular strength of the Finnish school system is that it guarantees equal learning opportunities for all regardless of social background. Tuition is free for everyone, and there is little variance in performance among schools. The PISA study also shows that learning differences among pupils in Finland are not as great as in many other countries and that the percentage of pupils with poor learning capacity is very low. An adequate level of competence (level 2 out of 6) or higher was achieved by 95.9% of the participating Finnish pupils in science, by 95.2% in literacy and by 94.1% in mathematics. Almost half of the participating Finnish pupils reached level 4 or higher in all these areas.<p><p>In the 2006 PISA tests Finnish youngsters came top in science.Photo: Anna Dammert<p><p>There are other factors, too, that explain the high performance of Finnish pupils. Security and motivation are fostered among the youngest schoolchildren by having the same teacher to take them through the first grades and by not measuring their performance by numbers. Compulsory school education begins at the age of seven, and until then children are free to enjoy a childhood at play. Instead of promoting comparison among pupils, an important objective of the Finnish school system is to support and guide pupils with special needs. Very few pupils are required to repeat a school year. Special attention has been paid to making the school environment pleasant and motivating. Teachers are a key factor, and Finnish teachers have high academic qualifications. Teacher-pupil relationships are open and cordial in Finnish schools. The costs of this school system are close to the European average, as is the number of lessons; the system can thus be considered highly cost-effective.<p><p>Earlier PISA studies were conducted in 2000, when the focus was on reading, and in 2003, with emphasis on mathematics. Finland is the top country when the rankings of all PISA studies are combined. The country’s success in the PISA process has generated considerable international interest, and other international studies have produced similar findings. The Finnish school system has been described in numerous international seminars, and thousands of visitors, notably teachers and politicians, from all over Europe and further afield have visited Finland to see schools at work.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, December 2007<p><p>Top results cost-effectively<p>", "time": "2009-06-24T08:18:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

They have about 50 dairy cows, but no longer have to rush to milk them. These days an automatic milking system takes care of that. The cows walk to the milking station by themselves when they feel like it; the machine cleans their udders, takes the necessary samples, milks them, and provides each cow with a programmed amount of feed concentrate. The farmer’s and his wife’s most important device is the computer that produces a real-time report on the cows’ milking behaviour and health. This level of efficiency compensates for the disadvantage of a short growing season.<p><p>“The amount of work done in the cowshed has decreased by a certain amount and the automatic milking system gives more flexibility in managing our time,” explains Esa happily. “Now I can attend the spring party at my children’s musical kindergarten, even if it is held at the traditional milking time,” he adds enthusiastically. Esa and Anu have two young daughters, Veera, 4, and Riina, 2.<p><p>Milch cows coming out from a byre.Photo: Salla Korpela<p><p>Nilsiä is located in a traditional dairy-farming region, which has experienced a powerful structural change in recent years. In the 1940s, the area comprised small family farms less than ten hectares in size, where people did all the work themselves and owned very little machinery. The farms of today are large in comparison, and most are equipped with the latest technology. The labour force on the farms is small, usually consisting of only a married couple, one of whom often has a second job elsewhere, at least part-time. This is the case in the Immonen family too — Esa’s other role is selling snowmobiles.<p><p>Esa and Anu have implemented changes to their farm themselves. When they took charge of the farm in August 2000, it comprised 22 dairy cows and about 40 hectares of arable land. Now the number of dairy cows has trebled, in addition to which there are 50 beef cattle, 40 heifers as well as calves. The area of land for growing grass and fodder grain for the cattle is double what it was when they started. To achieve all this Esa and Anu have invested heavily — mainly with borrowed money. But the young couple are not worried about the situation.<p><p>“We have calculated everything carefully,” explains Anu, who has an MSc in Economics and Business Administration. She takes care of the farm’s finances and the paperwork required by EU farming regulations, which these days takes up a lot of her time. Esa, who has a degree in agriculture, is responsible for planning and developing the work of the farm.<p><p>“Our most crucial asset is our skill in handling the work here. In principle, the farm functions in such a way that the everyday tasks can be managed by one person, if necessary.”<p><p>Farms in Finland often include a sizeable area of forest. Esa’s and Anu’s farm is no different with its total of 165 hectares of forest land. Timber is sold to forest companies as raw material for paper, and to sawmills. Productive forest holdings are sources of investment reserves and security for hard times. Forest maintenance in the form of replanting and clearing must be done annually in order to ensure that the forest remains productive.<p><p>The milk from the farm’s cows is first collected in a 5,000-litre refrigerated storage tank, then transported by a milk tanker every other evening to a dairy in Lapinlahti, about 40 kilometres away.<p><p>Elements of Finnish farming: cows, fields, and forest.Photo: Salla Korpela<p><p>Esa and Anu employ temporary workers during the busiest times of the year, the sowing and harvesting seasons, and they completely outsource some services and mechanical work, such as the forest maintenance previously referred to.<p><p>Esa believes thoughtful outsourcing makes good sense. “In the past, farmers were proud of the fact that they did everything themselves. It is not possible to think like that nowadays unless you want to work yourself into an early grave. It would also be unwise for every farmer to buy all the machinery needed as some of it is just so expensive,” he explains.<p><p>The previous owners of the farm, Esa’s parents, live in their own house on the property and help out. They look after the children when Esa and Anu are busy.<p><p>“All in all, this is a great job as there is so much freedom to plan and carry out the work and the results can be seen all around. I don’t even feel that the work is physically demanding,” explains Esa.<p><p>“And the cows don’t complain!”<p><p>In their free time, the Immonen family enjoy the opportunities of life in the country. Esa rides a motorbike in the summer, and a snowmobile in the winter, while Anu likes to ski. The family share an interest in dogs and dog shows.<p><p>Esa and Anu are even able to have a holiday. They are entitled to statutory leave of 23-24 days a year, while a municipal holiday substitute takes care of the daily routines at the farm. Esa and Anu also purchase the services of a holiday substitute for extra days off from the farm.<p><p> <p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, July 2005<p><p>From small family holding to successful business enterprise<p><p>Finnish farmers supported by forest<p><p>Country life leaves room for hobbies<p>", "time": "2010-07-26T08:37:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Peel the vegetables and onion, and cut them into small, equal-sized cubes. Mix them together and season with a little salt and white pepper.<p><p>Whip the cream lightly, season with sugar and vinegar and add a few drops of beetroot liquid for colour. Serve the dressing separately. Garnish the salad with hard-boiled eggs, the yolks and whites chopped separately and laid in stripes on the top. <p><p>Dressing:<p><p>Soak the salted mushrooms until the salt level is right. Press the excess water out and chop the mushrooms. Peel and chop the onion. Check the taste, it should have a slightly sharp tang. Stir the mushrooms and the chopped onions into the dressing.<p><p>The traditional Finnish mushroom salad is made of salted milk caps. Before salting, the cleaned mushrooms are boiled in plenty of water for five minutes, rinsed and cooled. Then the mushrooms are placed with layers of salt (salt content is 10-15% of the weight of the mushrooms) in glass jars. The mushrooms are pressed down into the jar by covering them with a weight, e.g. a plate with a clean stone on it, and stored in a cold place.<p><p> <p><p> <p><p>Ingredients:<p><p>Rice filling:<p><p><p><p>Bring the milk almost to boiling point. Combine the eggs and sour milk and add to the hot milk, stirring gently. Continue to cook the milk over low heat, stirring until it curdles. Remove the saucepan from the stove and let the whey separate in a warm place for half an hour. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the curds to a sieve lined with muslin. Lightly press the whey out. Add the salt, stirring in well. Place a light weight on the cheese and leave it to stand in a cold place overnight.<p><p>Next day, turn the cheese onto an ovenproof dish. Brush the cheese with egg and bake at 250 °C until nicely brown.<p><p> <p><p>(for four – five persons)<p><p>Cut the meat into cubes (4×4 cm). There is no need to remove small bones. Put the meat and coarsely chopped onion in layers in a casserole, seasoning each layer with salt and allspice.

Cover the casserole towards the end of the cooking time.<p><p>Serve with mashed potato, boiled swedes and lingonberry purée. <p><p>(for four – five persons)<p><p>Clean and fillet the fish. Boil the bones with coarsely chopped onion and spices. Cook for about 20 minutes. Strain the liquid into another saucepan. When the liquid comes to the boil, add the leek cut into rings and the peeled, diced potatoes. Cook for about 15 minutes. Cut the fish into chunks and add to the soup. Cook for another five minutes. Mix the flour with milk and add to the soup. Let the soup simmer for a few more minutes. Sprinkle plenty of chopped dill and chives on top of the soup.<p><p>If you want to use ready filleted fish, you will need 300-400 g. Add a fish bouillon cube to the liquid. <p><p>Served with: melted butter chopped raw onions<p><p>Peel the onions and split them in pieces. Place them in the water or fish stock together with the allspice berries and bring to the boil. Cook for a while for the stock to become tasty. Peel the potatoes and cut into small pieces the size of your fingertips. Also cut the fish fillets into small cubes. Remove the onions and allspice berries from the stock and add the potatoes to cook. Let the soup boil for about ten minutes. Then add the fish and continue to cook for a few minutes until the fish is done. Chop the herbs and add to the soup. Serve the soup with melted butter and chopped raw onions, which every eater can add to the soup according to taste. The soup is at its best when eaten with rye bread. <p><p>(for four – five persons)<p><p>Filling:<p><p><p><p>Topping:<p><p>Gravy:<p><p>Cut the stalk off the cabbage and cook the cabbage in salted water until the leaves are soft. You can carefully loosen the outer leaves as they soften. Lift the cooked cabbage onto a large plate to drain. Loosen the leaves one by one and chop the small inner leaves for the filling.<p><p>Finely chop the onion and fry in small amount of oil until translucent but not brown. Combine the meat, rice, chopped cabbage and seasonings into a smooth mixture. If the mixture is too thick, add some more of the cabbage cooking water.<p><p>Flatten the cabbage leaves. Lift a good tablespoonful of filling onto the leaf and roll it up tucking the edges round the mixture.<p><p>Place the rolls side by side in a baking dish, pour syrup and a little fat over them.<p><p>Bake the rolls for 1 hour at 200 °C. Half way turn the rolls over and baste them every now and then with the cabbage water.<p><p>Strain the pan juices and thicken with flour mixed with water. Add a little cream.<p><p>Serve the cabbage rolls with boiled potatoes and lingonberry purée. <p><p>(for four – five persons)<p><p>Gravy:<p><p>Mix breadcrumbs with water and cream in a bowl. Let stand for a while. Finely chop the onion and sauté in oil in a frying pan or microwave oven. Add the onion, egg, seasonings and meat. Mix until smooth. Wet your hands and shape the mixture into balls. Fry meatballs in hot fat on all sides. Small balls will be done in 3-5 minutes, larger ones 5-8 minutes.<p><p>To make gravy, brown the flour lightly in fat. Add the liquid stirring all the time. Add the cream and check seasonings. The gravy can be served separately or poured over the meatballs. Serve with potatoes and grated carrots. Lingonberry jam and gherkins also go well with the dish. <p><p>Omelette batter:<p><p>Filling:<p><p>On top:<p><p>Preheat the oven to 200° C. To prepare the batter, first mix the flour in the milk. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add to the flour and milk mixture. Spice with salt and white pepper. Line a high-edged baking plate with greaseproof paper and pour the omelette batter on the paper. Bake in the oven until light brown. Overturn the omelette on another piece of greaseproof paper and remove the paper from the bottom. Chop the onions for the filling. Fry the chopped mushrooms in hot oil, add the onions and let cook until the liquid has nearly evaporated. Spice with salt and pepper, and, if you like, basil or thyme. (In case you prefer the filling to be more saucelike, add a little cream to the mixture and let cook for a while). Check the taste. Spread the mixture on the omelette and roll the sheet up. Carefully move the roll on a greased ovenproof plate and sprinkle grated cheese on top. Heat the omelette roll in 200° C before serving. <p><p>Ingredients:<p><p>Stuffing:<p><p>Season the fish fillet with salt and black and lemon peppers to taste. Using a sharp knife, cut a less than one centimeter deep opening in the middle of the fillet from head to tail. Place the knife in the opening and cut a pocket to both sides of the opening. Unfold the pockets and spread the cheese in. Sprinkle finely chopped dill, chives and thyme on the cheese. Turn the upper side of each pocket on the cheese and herbs. Secure the opening with cocktail sticks some 5 cm apart. Sprinkle with lemon juice.<p><p>Bake in 200° C for about 20-25 minutes. When the fish is done, remove the sticks.<p><p>Serve with boiled potatoes and green salad.<p><p> <p><p>(for four – five persons)<p><p>Ingredients: – 200 g margarine or butter<p><p>To moisten:<p><p>Topping:<p><p>Icing:<p><p>Preheat the oven to 200°C.<p><p>Grind the almonds and combine them with the bread crumbs.

Grease a muffin mould and put a equal amount of the mixture into the hollows. Leave room for the mixture to raise in the hollows. Using a floured fingertip, press a hole in the middle of each muffin. Place about half a teaspoonful of jam or marmelade on each muffin. Bake in the middle of the oven for about 15 minutes.<p><p>Boil the water and melt the sugar in it. Flavour with the alcohol. Moisten the baked muffins with the liquid. When the muffins are still hot, add another half a teaspoonful of jam in the middle. Let the muffins cool.<p><p>Combine the icing sugar and water or lemon juice in a small bowl. Pour the liquid icing around the jam. <p><p>For frying:<p><p>On top:<p><p>1. Cut a thick slice of bread for each person 2. Whip the egg and mix in milk and a pinch of salt 3. Dip the slices in the milk and egg mixture 4. Fry until golden brown on both sides 5. Serve hot topped with a bit of lingonberry jam. If you top it all off with whipped cream, your “poor knights” become “rich knights”. <p><p>Place the berries in a serving dish. Put the cornflour and cold juice into a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring all the time. Remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the thickened juice over the berries. Sprinkle a little sugar on top. Serve with milk. Bilberries and strawberries or redcurrants and raspberries can also be used. <p><p>Combine all the ingredients in a buttered oven dish.<p><p>Bake the porridge for 4-5 hours at 125 °C. Also whole oats, wheat, rice, buckwheat or millet make excellent porridge. Serve the porridge with milk or fruit sauce. <p><p>1. Mix the flour and the milk. Add the salt and beat in the eggs.

{"title": "A border that once divided now unites - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/a-border-that-once-divided-now-unites/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finland and Russia are separated by a 1,340 kilometre-long border. This border has been pushed back and forth several times, mainly as a consequence of armed conflicts.<p><p>The existence of the border has aroused fears, and for many people it has meant something to be avoided. At the same time, however, it has also helped people to learn the basics of peaceful co-existence and how to benefit from the closeness of your neighbour.<p><p>Today, Finland’s eastern border is associated with growing prosperity and opportunities for cooperation on both sides.<p><p>The southernmost point of the land border between Finland and Russia is located on the shores of the Gulf of Finland, while the common boundary mark of Finland, Norway and Russia on Muotkavaara in Lapland is the northernmost tip. Some sections of the border are straight, while other sections meander through the shores of lakes and rivers, at the edge of bogs and fields, or in the middle of a forest. Towards the north, the terrain becomes hilly, and in Lapland becomes an uninhabited wilderness. The border zone on the Finnish side has a maximum width of three kilometres on land and four kilometres on sea. The outermost limit of the border zone is marked with yellow signs, rings painted on trees and plastic tape attached to trees. The actual boundary line is a strip of land between poles and stones acting as boundary marks. On the Finnish side the poles are blue and white, and on the Russian side, red and green. Buoys are used in water.<p><p>A permit is required for entering the border zone. A permit application can be submitted to the Headquarters of the Border Guard District, a Border Guard Command Post or a local Border Guard Station. For an application, you must prove your identity, give the necessary contact information and state the reasons for your application (such as owning property in the border zone, working in the border zone or visiting somebody living in the border zone).<p><p>During the Cold War, Finland’s eastern border was on the northern fringes of the Iron Curtain across Europe, and the closeness of the border aroused both fear and awe. Entering and crossing the border was only possible in special cases and only after lengthy bureaucratic processes. The border was heavily fortified and guarded and there were no contacts between people living on the two sides even though the distance between them was only a few kilometres. In those days Finland’s eastern border also signified the widest prosperity gap in the world and the decisions on trade between the two neighbours were made at government level.<p><p>A border zone mark.© The Finnish Border Guard<p><p>Boundary marks on a border of Finland and Russia.© The Finnish Border Guard<p><p>Today, there are daily contacts across the border at all levels. Even though a permit is still required in order to enter and stay in the border zone, the strip is not deserted. There are farms and other settlements at the very edge of the boundary line and though the border area is sparsely populated, there are towns and villages on both sides. On the Finnish side, these include the small industrial town of Imatra. The existence of the border has opened up new opportunities and it is no longer considered a threat.<p><p>A large proportion of the trade between northwestern Russia and the rest of the world goes through Finnish ports. In 2007, one million lorries crossed the border at Vaalimaa-Torfjanovka border crossing. Russian tourists make shopping trips to Finland and spend time at Finnish ski resorts. In fact, many of them have purchased holiday homes on the shores of the clean lakes of eastern Finland. At the same time, Finns make shopping trips to Vyborg and St. Petersburg and take in the culture these two cities have to offer. Heavy traffic has provided residents in near-deserted border areas with new business opportunities. In the old days, closeness to the border was a factor pushing plot and property prices down, whereas today, a location close to the frontier adds to the value of real estate.<p><p>Finland’s easter border (in red) and the most active frontier crossing points.<p><p>On the Finnish side, the border is guarded by the Border Guard, and in fact most of its 3,100 members of staff are deployed on Finland’s eastern border. The most important task of the border guards is to ensure that cross-border passenger traffic goes through the official border crossings and that all formalities are adhered to. There are 13 official border crossings between Finland and Russia and, if necessary, ten additional border crossings can also be opened on a temporary basis. Cross-border traffic is heavy: Some 7.2 million people crossed the border between Finland and Russia in 2007, and the figure was 5% more than in the year before. The border between Finland and Russia is also the external border of the Schengen area, within which border controls have been abolished. This means that the Finnish Border Guard also makes a contribution to pan-European security. Controlling freight traffic is the responsibility of the Customs.<p><p>The land border is traditionally supervised by dog patrols on foot or on skis, by keeping lookout, and by carrying out surveillance using aeroplanes, cross-country vehicles and helicopters. The sea border is primarily supervised using a range of radar and camera systems and patrol boats. Even though the border is long and there is not enough staff to keep an eye on every kilometre all the time, illegal crossings are rare. In 2007, there were 27 unauthorised border crossings into Finland, and three into Russia. Nearly all those crossing the border illegally are caught.<p><p>Cooperation between the Finnish and Russian border guards is close and smooth.<p><p>The Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs commissioned an aerial photography project which was carried out by the National Land Survey of Finland (NLS). The flights took place in summer 2005 but the issues concerning the use of the images must still be resolved by the Finnish and Russian border commissions.<p><p>The aerial images produced are at a scale of 1:31,000. Seven flights covering more than 1,400 kilometres were required and the aeroplane had to make turns on both sides of the border. Faultless communications between the flight and ground control authorities of the two countries were required to complete these 20-kilometre-long loops.<p><p>As the work involved flights on and across the border, the Finnish flight crew was accompanied by a Russian navigator observer, as required by the Russian authorities. The navigator observer was in touch with Russian control centres, while the Finnish crew maintained contacts with its own flight and ground control authorities.<p><p>The border demarcation was carried out between 11 and 13 September. Orthophotomaps at a scale of 1:20,000 adjusted to map coordinates will be produced in Russia.<p><p>The border between Sweden and Finland was also demarcated the same year. As the border mostly follows the deep-water channel of the border rivers, the most important aim of the demarcation process was to determine the channel and to present it on maps. The National Land Survey of Sweden was responsible for making the boundary marks more visible, while the aerial photography was the responsibility of the NLS. The demarcation of Finland’s western border is carried out every 25 years.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, June 2008<p><p> <p><p>Life on the border<p><p>The border is closely guarded but everything takes place in good spirit<p><p><p><p>Finland’s eastern border photographed from the air for the first time<p>", "time": "2014-06-11T10:02:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Family-friendly Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/family-friendly-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finns pay high taxes but get a lot in return for their money. Families with children are especially well taken care of by society, and their lives are made easier by the many types of support and benefits available.<p><p>Let’s meet the Tuurala family from Helsinki and see how they benefit from society’s support for families with children. Clicking on the underlined words will bring up more information about the forms of support available in Finland.<p><p>Kati and Klaus Tuurala and their daughters Freja and Iiris (6 and 4 years old at the original time of publication) live close to the centre of Helsinki in Ruoholahti. They lead an active life and earn an average income.<p><p>Kati, 36, works full-time and her husband Klaus, 61, is retired. His last position was at telecoms company Sonera as a usability expert. He has used his retirement to return to studying at the University of Helsinki. The couple’s daughters are in municipal family daycare and Freja also attends preschool. But before going into greater detail, let us turn back the clock six years to when Kati and Klaus were about to become parents.<p><p>When Kati discovered she was pregnant, she did what all mothers-to-be do in Finland. She got in touch with the prenatal clinic in her own area. There she was assigned a midwife whose clinics she attended at least once a month during the pregnancy for check-ups and observation.<p><p>Kati was allowed to choose in which of the three local area hospitals that were part of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa she would like to give birth. She chose the Kätilöopisto Maternity Hospital because of the homely Haikaranpesä (Stork’s nest) ward, which is especially for women wishing to have a natural, active birth. As prospective parents in the ‘Stork’s nest ward’, Kati and Klaus went and had a look at the maternity unit and met the staff in advance.<p><p>Wrapping up warm on a winter morning.Photo: Elina Bicsák<p><p>The couple discussed the birthing plan with the midwife, and familiarized themselves with the equipment and methods used to ease the birth and relieve pain. They also took part in antenatal classes held at the Stork’s nest with other expecting couples. Prospective fathers had their own discussion group. The birth went well, and the couple were left with pleasant memories of the event.<p><p>Klaus was present at the birth, and the whole family spent the night at the hospital in their own room. The midwife assigned to them for the birth visited them at home during the baby’s first weeks to check on progress and to teach the parents how the baby should be carried in a baby sling. The Tuuralas had everything ready for the baby on her arrival home, including little vests and suits in the cupboard together with the babycare equipment. Some of the baby gear they had bought themselves, while some they had received in the maternity package supplied by the state.<p><p>Kati went on maternity leave from Akava, her employer at the time, 5 weeks before the due date. Klaus took three weeks paternity leave when the child was born. When baby Freja was about four months old, Kati continued to look after her on parental leave and for some months after that on care leave. A daily allowance paid by the Social Insurance Institution (commonly known by its Finnish abbreviation, Kela) guaranteed the family income during these periods of leave.<p><p>Since the birth of Freja, the state has been paying child allowance directly into the parents’ bank account. This allowance will continue until the child reaches 17 years of age.<p><p>Kati returned to work when Freja was 16 months old. She taught as a part-time teacher while finishing her teacher-training studies at the same time. The Tuuralas applied for a municipal family daycare place for Freja and their request was successful. Freja was looked after near home by a friendly lady called Riitta. The family’s second child, Iiris, was born when Freja was 2 years and four months old. The birth and benefits for the child were as before, with the exception that instead of the maternity pack the Tuuralas opted for the maternity grant and a higher rate of child allowance was paid for the second child.<p><p>And off we go to school.Photo: Elina Bicsák<p><p>Kati went to work for the publishing company WSOY a year after Iiris’s birth, and Iiris was able to go to the same family daycare as Freja, which both girls are still attending. Freja, who starts school next autumn, attends a preschool class at a nearby daycare centre in the mornings, and in the afternoon is in Riitta’s care. If one of the children falls ill she cannot go to daycare but must remain at home. In a situation like this, one of the parents has the right by law to stay at home to look after the sick child. If she so wished, Kati’s former employer, WSOY, would also pay for a carer for the sick child for the days when Kati had to be at work. Now that Klaus has retired he looks after the children at home when they are sick.<p><p>Fortunately, the Tuuralas’ children have been healthy. Since their birth, the children have attended their local child welfare clinic to be examined by a doctor or nurse at least once a month during their first year and after that at least once a year. The children’s growth and development is checked at the clinic and they receive vaccinations in accordance with the national vaccination programme. The children’s teeth are also checked at the clinic’s dental surgery once a year.<p><p>If they become unwell and need to see a doctor, they will be seen on the same day in the emergency medical clinic of their local health centre or at the city’s emergency clinic for children. If they have symptoms requiring further examination or treatment by a specialist, they will be referred to the children’s hospitals in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District. All services provided by child welfare clinics, dental clinics and health centres are free for children.<p><p>The Tuuralas’ home is cosy, but not very large; many families with children face the same situation since living costs in Finland, and Helsinki in particular, are relatively high. The government alleviates this problem by allowing a tax deduction for interest on owner-occupied housing.<p><p>Families with children are never short of housework. The Tuuralas get some respite thanks to their home help, Leena, who comes to clean their home once a fortnight. The Tuuralas can offset the wage and social costs they pay on her behalf against their own tax as a domestic help credit. When they modernised their kitchen a few years ago, they were also able to deduct the labour costs of the builder and plumber from their taxes.<p><p>When their daughters were small, they attended infant swimming lessons with their parents and mother and toddler exercise classes. Nowadays, Klaus takes Freja to the fairytale gym every week and while she is there he takes Iiris to choose books to take home from a special children’s library. The children’s pastimes do not cost much because the facilities are provided by civic organizations that receive financial assistance. The girls spend some time every week in the local children’s play park, which has outdoor playground equipment provided by the local authority and is supervised during the daytime.<p><p>Does reading this leave you breathless? Perhaps it’s no surprise that there are dozens more forms of social support and services for families with children in Finland that could be described, but we included the most important ones here.<p><p>Effective family policies have achieved at least two things: Finland has for a long time had one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, and mothers have a significantly better chance of being active in working life than in many other EU countries.<p><p>Why not join Freja and Iiris? Put your ice skates on and head for the rink in your local park — which the council workmen have just iced over to the great delight of the local youngsters.<p><p>By Salla Korpela, updated April 2016<p><p>Home sweet home<p><p>The big day<p><p>Back to work<p>", "time": "2010-09-14T13:11:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "The Åland example: Autonomy protects a minority - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/the-example-of-aland-autonomy-as-a-minority-protector/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Åland is a group of islands located off the southwestern tip of Finland. Its special autonomy agreement is of interest not only to the local population, but also to many other nations. The archipelago has attracted and continues to attract international attention as an example of how to successfully secure the position of a minority.<p><p>The words “war” and “armed conflict” bring to mind classic warfare between countries, but in today’s world such clashes are becoming more of an exception than a rule. Accordingly, many of the armed conflicts currently under way around the globe are internal struggles in countries with some sort of minority issue. Such issues cannot be resolved by creating new, small, independent states ad infinitum. Looking for alternatives to nation building, countries turn their eyes towards Åland, whose autonomy is perceived as a compromise between independence and total integration.<p><p>A large number of politicians, reporters and researchers have studied Åland’s autonomy as a potential solution to conflicts. The list of regions and minorities that have led people to take an interest in Åland is long: Israel-Palestine; Nagorno-Karabakh in the South Caucasus region; Northern Ireland; Georgia; Kosovo; Sri Lanka; Aceh in Indonesia; Kashmir between India and Pakistan; Zanzibar; and East Timor. Some have examined Åland’s model in an attempt to avert a crisis, while others are trying to find a solution to a conflict that has already broken out.<p><p>The sun shines behind an Åland flag billowing at the back of a boat, with islands visible in the background.Photo: Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva<p><p>How, then, can Åland really serve as an example? Writing a functional constitution is hard, but it is not impossible. There are many experts on international and constitutional law who are capable of framing regulations that protect the rights of minorities, but the real problem is often to make them work in practice.<p><p>There is no doubt that Åland has a functioning system of autonomy based not only on a good constitution but also on workable reality. During numerous visits by representatives of various minorities, it has been significant to recall how a minority that initially refused to accept any form of self-rule subsequently built up a well-functioning society with the help of such autonomy. When Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917, Ålanders expressed interest in the islands being ceded back to Sweden. This became the source of some regional tension. In 1921 the Council of the League of Nations put into place guarantees for Åland’s autonomy, and a convention on Åland’s demilitarisation and neutralisation was created.<p><p>Åland is a society that enjoys amiable relations with both its motherlands, old and new. What’s more, Åland is a prime example of how autonomy can be extended over time. Every problem does not have to be solved at once; self-government can be expanded at an appropriate moment.<p><p>There is full awareness in Åland that no single solution can ever be universally applied to other problems, which is why Ålanders would prefer to speak of their home as an example rather than a model. They have no ambitions of imposing their solution on anybody, nor do they have the power to do so. In fact, the absence of any such power may be a blessing, just like the fact that nobody can suspect Åland of pursuing any self-interest in this matter.<p><p>Boathouses squint against the sun by a bay in Geta, an area of northern Åland.Photo: Udo Haafke/Visit Finland<p><p>The preconditions for autonomy in Åland have been and remain favourable. Åland has geographically well-defined boundaries and linguistic homogeneity. Finland is a democratic country based on the rule of law, and controversy over Åland’s affiliation has never included any violence. Such circumstances do not exist in many of today’s conflict areas.<p><p>That said, it was never self-evident that Åland would become a success story. After all, the odds are not the best when autonomy is imposed on people against their will, as was the case with Åland. However, Åland’s example shows that a solution with which all the parties were initially dissatisfied can be successful in the long term.<p><p>Åland is known for its autonomy, but also for the proximity of unspoiled nature in the archipelago.Photo: Tiina Tahvanainen/Visit Åland<p><p>Numerous studies on Åland’s political status have shown that the issues attracting interest are wide-ranging indeed. Here are some examples:<p><p>1. Autonomy secured by the Finnish Constitution: The Act on the Autonomy of Åland provides for a division of political power between Åland and the rest of Finland. Laws affecting Åland’s status are passed following the procedure prescribed for the enactment of constitutional legislation subject to adoption by the Parliament of Åland (Lagtinget), meaning that the island’s autonomy enjoys very strong legal protection. In practice, this means that Åland can veto any changes to the division of power between Åland and the central government of Finland.<p><p>2. Origin of self-government in Åland: The fact that the Åland issue was settled by an international resolution arouses a lot of interest. The decision of the League of Nations was a compromise that took into consideration not only the two countries involved but also the interests of the local population and, above all, the need to protect their language.<p><p>3. International guarantees: As a result of the involvement of the League of Nations in the establishment of self-rule, Åland secured international guarantees for its language and local customs. Consequently, the preservation of the Swedish language is both a national and international matter.<p><p>4. Language regulations: Åland is the only region in Finland with only one official language (Swedish), whereas the rest of the country is bilingual (Finnish and Swedish). The regulations concerning the language used in administration and education attract a lot of interest.<p><p>5. Division of power: The fact that legislative powers are divided between the central government and Åland, and not delegated, is of interest. Many people have studied the question of what legislative powers can be assigned to self-governing bodies and what areas are of such nature that they apply to the country as a whole.<p><p>6. Regional citizenship: Regional citizenship, which is a precondition for land ownership and transaction of business, is reserved exclusively for persons permanently residing in Åland. Additionally, regional citizenship is a prerequisite for eligibility to vote in local parliamentary elections.<p><p>7. Law and order: The fact that most members of the police force come from Åland has created a degree of interest in places where it is important that the police enjoy the confidence of the local population.<p><p>8. The Åland Delegation: The role of the Åland Delegation as an intermediary between the central government and Åland continues to attract interest.<p><p>9. Symbols: The flag of Åland is often of great interest to people, just like Åland’s passport, which has the words “Suomi,” “Finland” (the Finnish and Swedish words for “Finland”) and “Åland” printed on the cover, all in the same font size.<p><p>10. Influence over international agreements: Even though foreign policy is in the domain of the central government, Åland is not without influence in this area. Under the Act on the Autonomy of Åland, the consent of the Parliament of Åland is required for international agreements affecting the inherent powers of the province; for instance, this provision meant that the Parliament had to take a position on joining the EU along with Finland in 1995.<p><p>11. Participation in Nordic cooperation: Nordic cooperation is a noteworthy form of cross-border cooperation. It entitles the Nordic self-governing regions to participate more or less on the same terms as sovereign states.<p><p>12. Pragmatism: The people of Åland have always been down-to-earth with little interest in theoretical speculation. For one thing, they have never bothered to discuss whether they should be perceived as a minority, a matter that has generated lively debate and disagreement elsewhere. Instead, the people of Åland have focused on tangible regulations that secure their interests.<p><p>Calm water reflects a shoreline village in Kökar, southeastern Åland.Photo: Udo Haafke/Visit Finland<p><p>Åland has had and will continue to have the resources to respond to the interest that its political status generates worldwide. This helpful openness seems certain to remain part of the character of the province.<p><p>Ålanders have realised that it is of great importance for the credibility of the Åland example that representatives of both the majority and minority of the local population have declared that they are pleased with the solution. The central government is also interested in providing information about the Åland solution in situations where it may be of relevance. To this end, the Åland Government and the State of Finland have jointly appointed a contact group under the auspices of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.<p><p>This is where Åland is located on the map.<p><p>Åland has a special status in Finland as a demilitarized, neutral and autonomous region. The basis for this rests in the Treaty of Paris that ended the Crimean War in 1856. Their demilitarized, neutral status was confirmed and extended in subsequent treaties, in particular the multilateral Åland Convention, concluded in 1921 on the initiative of the League of Nations.<p><p>The autonomous status of Åland is also based on a decision of the Council of the League of Nations in 1921 that resolved a dispute between Finland and Sweden over the islands and is intended to guarantee the preservation of the local language, which is Swedish, and the local culture. Åland has its own representative on the Nordic Council, as have the other Nordic self-governing areas, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.<p><p>Åland consists of more than 6,500 islands and skerries, of which 6,400 are larger than 3,000 square metres (32,000 square feet, less than half of a standard soccer field). The current population of 29,000 inhabits only 65 islands, and over 40 percent live in the only actual town, the capital, Mariehamn.<p><p>Here’s a closer view of Åland and southwestern Finland.<p><p>Nature is perhaps Åland’s greatest attraction. The climate is milder than elsewhere in Finland, the bird population is exceptionally varied and the flora is very distinctive.<p><p>The special character of the islands has inspired painters, writers and musicians over the centuries, and today they attract many people interested in sailing, traditional boat-building, fishing, cycling, summer cultural events and historical ruins.<p><p>Source: Portraying Finland: Facts and Insights (Otava)<p><p>By Susanne Eriksson, senior legal adviser, Åland Parliament; updated June 2017<p><p>Making the constitution work<p><p>Favourable preconditions help<p><p>Features of autonomy<p><p>Åland as an international example<p><p>Even more about Åland<p>", "time": "2014-07-21T08:03:00+00:00", "type": "life"}
{"title": "Sámi language in the digital age - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/sami-language-in-the-digital-age/", "review": "", "content": "<p>After this article, your spellchecker’s red lines will never seem the same again.<p><p>Spellchecker – it seems like such an insignificant thing, doesn’t it? It’s not often you click on “Check spelling” and think, “This function is a small part of a larger effort to help this language survive for the next generation.”<p><p>But that’s precisely how Sjur Moshagen and his colleagues think. A Norwegian linguist who lives in Helsinki, Moshagen develops wordlists and source code for computer spellcheckers in the Sámi languages. “The most important thing is of course that parents speak Sámi with their children,” he says, “but a spellchecker can play a big role for a language.”<p><p>Perhaps a word about the Sámi languages is in order here. They are distantly related to Finnish. Moshagen uses the plural, “languages”, since ten dialects exist or have existed, some so distinct that experts may refer to them as separate languages.<p><p>Six variants of Sámi are still spoken, while the others have become extinct or are used by only a handful of people. The Sámi-speaking area covers the roof of Europe, stretching over Norway, Sweden, Finland and a corner of Russia. Those countries’ majority languages overlap the region.<p><p>The project that employs Moshagen is sponsored by the Norwegian Sámi Parliament and a couple Norwegian government ministries. It began in late 2004 and by the end of 2007 the team had completed spellcheckers for Northern Sámi and Lule Sámi. Funding was renewed and they are now working on Southern Sámi.<p><p>Whether you speak Sámi or not, you still know what that red line means.<p><p>From an English-speaking or even a Finnish-speaking point of view, it might be hard to grasp the significance of a spellchecker. After all, English speakers have had spellcheckers since the dawn of word processing. You know, back when there was no internet, remember? Oh well, never mind about that.<p><p>The point is that Sámi children, even if they come from households where the language is strong, will soon get older, look around and ask, “Where else can I speak Sámi?” Computers are everywhere in our digital age, and if Sámi can be used accessibly in digital communication, then it will feel as natural to use it for email, chat sites and other online stuff as it does to speak it with parents or grandparents.<p><p>Moshagen notes that this is already happening. “There are Sámi-speaking online communities and a lot of young Sámi people not only speak Sámi daily, but write it too,” he says. Still, many Sámi speakers are not used to writing their language.<p><p>Why? For many decades, the Sámi and their language were marginalised by the Nordic countries’ majority populations. Many Sámi resorted to using their own language only at home, if at all. According to Moshagen, the situation began to improve in the 1970s in Norway; Sweden and Finland are generally thought to lag behind their neighbour in this process.<p><p>He sees spellchecker as a source of support for those who know Sámi but have trouble writing it, whatever their age: “They can easily see when they’ve written something wrong, correct it and keep going.”<p><p>More of the Sámi spellchecker team: Trond Trosterud (left), Maaren Palismaa, Thomas Omma and Børre Gaup.Photo: Sjur Moshagen<p><p>“There are many heartrending stories of parents who chose not to speak Sámi with their children,” Moshagen says. “This shows how enormous the societal pressure must have been.”<p><p>Attitudes are changing and now many young parents of Sámi origin, even those who don’t know Sámi themselves, are demanding that their parents speak Sámi to the grandchildren. “You can skip one generation, but not two,” says Moshagen.<p><p>He says the spellchecker can form the basis for further projects. Next in line are grammar checking and speech synthesis (the computer reading text aloud). The same technology could easily be put to use in mobile phones for predictive texting.<p><p>Nokia, and that other company with the vaguely Swedish name, are you listening?

Until then Finland had been an integral part of the Swedish realm for more than 600 years.<p><p>Finland’s destiny was sealed in Tilsit, in 1807, when Napoleon and the Russian Tsar Alexander I came to an agreement on their respective spheres of influence. Finland, situated in the Russian sphere, was conquered in the Finnish War of 1808–09.<p><p>Ehrenström’s city plan, 1820Drawing: Captain Anders Kocke<p><p>The cornerstone of modern Finland was laid in 1809 at the Porvoo Diet, where Tsar Alexander proclaimed himself constitutional ruler of the new Grand Duchy and promised to maintain the faith and laws of the land (Porvoo is located about 50 kilometres (about 30 miles) east of Helsinki). Historian Matti Klinge has pointed out that Sweden ceded a mere conglomerate of provinces to Russia; the Porvoo Diet united them as a state, “raised to the rank of nations.”<p><p>The creation of a capital was a clear indication of the Tsar’s will to make the new Grand Duchy a functioning entity. Under Swedish rule, the southwestern city of Turku (called Åbo in Swedish, which is still one of Finland’s official languages) had been the administrative and spiritual centre of Finland, but Stockholm had of course been its capital. In 1812 Alexander declared Helsinki – a small town of about 4,000 inhabitants – the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1808 the town had been badly damaged by a fire in which one third of the residents had lost their homes.<p><p>This plaque on the wall of the university library terrace reminds passers-by of Ehrenström’s and Engel’s achievements.Photo: Matti Hurme<p><p>On the same day as Alexander declared Helsinki the new capital he appointed the military engineer Johan Albrecht Ehrenström, a former courtier of Sweden’s King Gustav III, head of the reconstruction committee. Ehrenström’s task was, in accordance with the wishes of Tsar Alexander, to rebuild the new capital in an unprecedentedly grand manner, “in order to show both Finns and the outside world that a new political unit, the Grand Duchy of Finland, had come into being,” as Klinge puts it.<p><p>In 1817 Ehrenström’s final town plan was ratified. Senate Square, bordered by a church and various administrative buildings, became the monumental centre of the plan. In the words of art historian Riitta Nikula, Ehrenström thus created “the symbolic heart of the Grand Duchy of Finland, where all the main institutions had an exact place dictated by their function in the hierarchy.” Ehrenström’s plan provided a fine outline for the construction of the new capital, but without a skilful architect the whole project could have faltered. Fortunately, he found one in Prussian-born Carl Ludvig Engel.<p><p>Senate Square in 1820© The National Library of Finland/Drawing: C.L. Engel<p><p>Carl Ludvig Engel (1778–1840), who had received his diploma in architecture from the Berlin Bauakademie in 1804, found no work in Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars. He applied for and received an appointment as city architect in Tallinn (Estonia). Soon he visited Finland and was asked to design an observatory for the Academy in Turku.<p><p>Ehrenström first met the talented young architect in 1814 and was immediately convinced that he had found the right man. After spending a couple of years in Saint Petersburg, Engel considered moving back to Berlin, but he was appointed architect of the reconstruction committee for Helsinki in 1816 and remained in Finland for the rest of his life.<p><p>Engel was thrilled by his new task: “Few architects have the good fortune to plan an entire city,” he explained in a letter to a friend. And Engel had every right to express himself this way; within a quarter of a century he had designed and completed about 30 public buildings in Helsinki, all in his chosen Neoclassical (Empire) style. Some of the buildings have been demolished, but his most important creations around Senate Square are preserved.<p><p>The first building to be completed was the main wing of the Senate (now the Palace of the Council of State) in 1822. The main University building, on the opposite side of Senate Square, was inaugurated in 1832. The general form of the building is similar to the Senate, but another expression can be found in the details. The University Library, completed in 1844 after Engel’s death, has often been praised as his most beautiful building.<p><p>No building task occupied Engel so long as the Lutheran church on the northern side of Senate Square. He worked on it from 1818 until his death in 1840. The Lutheran Cathedral, then called the Church of Nicholas, dominated the square and was finally consecrated twelve years later, in 1852. By the middle of the century, the new Empire-style Helsinki was finally ready. In his book Senate Square, professor Nils Erik Wickberg describes the result in the following way:<p><p>“It was a city in light colours – mainly yellow and grey – in which practically every building was in the same style, with the same kinds of cornices, window surroundings, pilasters and pediments and with the same low roof slope. There it lay, resplendently framed by sea inlets and bare masses of grey rock, which was later built on or converted into parks. When the distinguished poet, Bishop Frans Michael Franzén, who had moved to Sweden in the same year Ehrenström returned to Finland, visited Helsinki in 1840, he compared the city to a butterfly which has flown out of its cocoon and to Thebes charmed into place with the music of Amphion’s magic lyre.”<p><p> <p><p>A demonstration against the Russian-imposed unlawful conscription, 1902. © National Board of Antiquities<p><p>People gathering in Senate Square during the general strike, 1905. © National Board of Antiquities<p><p>Nicolai Church, now known as Helsinki Cathedral, on a postcard from 1916. © National Board of Antiquities<p><p>Trooping the colour to commemorate the arrival of the White forces in Helsinki, late 1920s.<p><p>A view of Senate Square at the beginning of the 20th century. © National Board of Antiquities<p><p>A military parade, late 1920s. © National Board of Antiquities<p><p>A public ceremony on Senate Square, early 1930s. © National Board of Antiquities<p><p>New Year’s Eve celebration in the 1930s.

{"title": "Parliamentarism in Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/life-society/parliamentarism-in-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>If we had to select three important dates from the whole of Finland’s political history, they could well be 1809, 1906 and 1917.<p><p>In 1809, after a period of more than 600 years, Finland ceased to be the easternmost part of the Kingdom of Sweden and was “elevated as a nation among nations” by becoming an autonomous grand duchy under the Russian tsar. In 1906, the traditional Diet of Four Estates was replaced by a democratic representative parliament characterised by universal and equal suffrage, universal eligibility and unicameralism. On 6 December 1917, Parliament (Eduskunta) proclaimed Finland an independent republic. Many of the structures of state had been created during the previous hundred years, if not earlier.<p><p>Today, Finland is a parliamentary democracy based on competition among political parties, power being divided among the highest organs of government. It does not in every respect fit into categories of parliamentarism constructed by political scientists. After some incremental changes in the 1990s, culminating in the constitutional reform of 2000, the elements of the Finnish parliamentary system are seeking and finding new roles that are tested and concretised in everyday politics.<p><p>The Finnish Constitution crystallizes the main principles of governance in very plain terms. Power in Finland is vested in the people, who are represented by deputies assembled in Parliament. Legislative power is exercised by Parliament, the President of the Republic having a minor role. The highest level of government of the state is the Council of State (the Government) which consists of a Prime Minister and a requisite number of ministers. Members of the Government shall have the confidence of the Parliament. Judicial power is vested in independent courts of law, at the highest level in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court.<p><p>A distinctive feature of Finland’s Constitution is its rigidity. A constitutional law can be amended only if two-thirds of the members of Parliament agree. Two consecutive Parliaments have to adopt the changes. The same Parliament can amend a law if the amendment has previously been declared “urgent”. This calls for a five-sixths majority, which means agreement among at least four or five parties. In spite of this formal rigidity, there have been many incremental changes to the Constitution during the past twenty years. One aim has been to increase the flexibility of political decision-making. The price of this has been a weakening of the parliamentary opposition’s available options for manoeuvre.<p><p>Relations between Parliament, the Government and the President of the Republic are governed by the principles of European party-based parliamentarism. The Government must enjoy the support of a majority in Parliament, which elects the Prime Minister. The President traditionally has had considerable power in the area of foreign policy, although not as much or such undisputed power as his or her American or French counterparts. Under the constitutional reform of 2000, the President’s power in other political areas is limited; but the power to appoint senior civil servants does incorporate the potential for acts of political significance. The Government has to cooperate with both the President and Parliament, but when successful, this relationship strengthens the Government’s position in practical politics.<p><p>Situated on the main thoroughfare Mannerheimintie, the Parliament building is visible to anyone traversing downtown Helsinki by bus, train, tram or car.Photo: Joanna Moorhouse/Eduskunta<p><p>The history of the Finnish Parliament can be traced back to the 17th century, when the four estates of Finland were given the right to send their own representatives to the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates. At its birth in 1906, the Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta) was something of a rarity. It was unicameral and elected by universal suffrage, women included. Basically, the key elements of parliamentary organisation have remained unchanged for the past 100 years. In elections to choose the 200 Members of Parliament in recent years, about 70 percent of Finns over the age of 18, and eligible to vote, have done so. In the Parliament elected in 2011, no less than 85 of the members were women.<p><p>Parliament convenes – usually four times a week – for plenary sessions during which it debates matters, or rather makes speeches about them, and makes decisions by voting. MPs often put questions to members of the Government. It is unusual for an MP to vote against his or her party line. In principle, MPs have a free mandate; but in practice they have a party mandate, as in many other countries.<p><p>Much of an MP’s time is spent working in committees. The committees are preparatory bodies, usually comprising 17 MPs, through whose hands pass matters to be decided by Parliament. The committees regularly engage outside experts. The composition of the committees reflects the strength of each party in Parliament. As can be seen from the results of parliamentary elections, no single party is in a decisive position. Meetings of the parties’ own parliamentary groups are also important working forums for MPs.<p><p>Parliament has three main functions through which it represents the people and makes basic decisions on Finnish policy. It passes laws, it debates and approves the national budget and it supervises the way the country is governed.<p><p>Passing laws is a complicated process that usually begins with the Government placing a bill before Parliament, which it does some 200 to 300 times a year. Individual MPs may, and often do, propose legislation, but Government bills take preference and are better prepared. Parliament has no official machinery for making or preparing proposals. To be passed, a bill must have the support of a majority in Parliament and it must be signed by the President of the Republic. It takes about two to four months for a bill to be processed, in some cases even longer.<p><p>The national budget, presented to Parliament annually, is also prepared by the Government and much of the autumn period is devoted to debating it. Any changes made to the budget in Parliament tend to be marginal.<p><p>Parliament supervises the Government in many ways, both juridically and, in particular, politically. When a Government is being formed, Parliament has the vital role of electing a Prime Minister. When a new Government has been formed, it presents its political programme to Parliament. In accordance with a principle of classical parliamentarism, the Government must enjoy the confidence of a majority of MPs.<p><p>Every year, Parliament submits hundreds of written or oral questions to the Government or its individual ministers. Parliament may also test the degree of confidence enjoyed by the Government by making an interpellation. The result of the subsequent vote of confidence decides whether the Government may continue in office. Generally, the publicity attracted by such a move is greater than the risk to the Government. The risk last arose in the late 1950s, but this has not lessened the use of the interpellation.<p><p>Parliament also supervises the Bank of Finland, which is the central bank, and the Finnish Broadcasting Company, the country’s public service broadcaster.<p><p>Today, governments are predominately coalition governments with strong majorities. This allows them to be fairly confident that the MPs for the parties the governments represent will be loyal. Most ministers also act as MPs, which in turn allows them to participate in parliamentary voting.<p><p>Employers’ and labour organisations are not among the classical parliamentary players. In Finland, however, they often do have quite a noticeable – if not decisive – political role, particularly in issues concerning work and social security.<p><p>The Government produces most of the material that Parliament deals with and uses as the basis for its decisions. The President formally appoints and dissolves the Government and he or she also suggests a candidate for Prime Minister, after negotiating with the parties in Parliament and consulting the Speaker of Parliament. In practice, the main role in the formation, functions and dissolution of the Government is played by the political parties involved.<p><p>If a Government resigns between parliamentary elections, the reason is usually disagreement among the Government parties that has come to light when the Government has had to make a difficult decision, or when its own bills are being dealt with by Parliament. After parliamentary elections the Government resigns. In recent years, from four to six parties have been represented in the Government and, in spite of their political heterogeneity, governments have been very stable.<p><p>The functions of ministers are extensive. They prepare the national budget and legislative reforms and, after obtaining the approval of Parliament and the President, implement the latter. The Government may also pass statutes if so authorised by Parliament. The ministers each direct their ministries with relative independence. There are 12 ministries, including the Prime Minister’s Office, and no more than 20 ministers. If an MP is appointed as a minister, he or she continues to work as an MP. Most ministers have this double role. It is normal practice that the leaders of the parties forming the Government, i.e. the party chairpersons, also act as ministers. But there are exceptions to this practice.<p><p>The main collective functions of the Government are sessions over which the President presides, ordinary sessions and evening sessions. The President attends only the first of these sessions, it being the highest level of the Government’s decision-making authority in legislative matters. An evening session is an informal occasion at which matters are prepared for discussion. It provides a useful opportunity for multi-party cabinets to try to reach agreement before actual decisions have to be made. There are also more limited preparatory ministerial committees; the most important of which handles all economic policy matters and could be regarded as the core of the Government. The President may attend meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy.<p><p>The session presided over by the President is usually held on Fridays. Also present is the Attorney General, who oversees the legality of the procedures and decisions. At these sessions, the President formally makes his or her decisions on whether bills should be placed before Parliament or whether acts passed by Parliament should be signed. The President may go against the majority opinion of the Government. Similarly, he or she may refuse to sign a law passed by Parliament, in which case it does not come into effect. There is usually no visible conflict with the Government, however, because decisions are always well prepared and have gone through many stages. Finland’s presidents have refused to sign a law once a year on average. Moreover, Parliament may approve the same law again after it has been rejected by the President. If this happens, the law will come into effect without having been signed by the President.<p><p>The most important sanction open to the President in his or her relations with Parliament has been the right to dissolve Parliament and call new elections. This has happened seven times since 1917, and most recently in 1975. Under the constitutional reform of 1991, the President cannot dissolve Parliament if the Prime Minister has not made a proposal to that effect. Otherwise, interaction between the President and Parliament is limited to certain state ceremonies. For example, the President opens Parliament each year and declares Parliament closed at the end of an electoral period. Also, upon being elected, the President makes his or her solemn pledge of office before Parliament.<p><p>Party leaders take part in a TV debate before the 2015 parliamentary election.Photo: Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva<p><p>During its approximately 100-year history, the Finnish political party system has been relatively stable. The historical background for the party divisions includes the ideal of nationality, the language issue (Swedish is a minority and official language), the socialist versus non-socialist divide, representation of the rural population, and the two-way division of the political Left. In Finland’s multiparty system, support for the parties runs approximately along the following lines: the three or four biggest parties each have around 20 percent of popular support and about ten smaller parties compete for the remainder – and half of them succeed in getting seats in Parliament.<p><p>In Parliament, it is essential for the parties to cooperate among themselves in the preparation of the budget and other legislation, but the representatives of the parties who are Government ministers are traditionally loyal to the Government’s line and the opposition parties do not normally form strong coalitions. Since the time when Finland became independent, the Centre Party (formerly the Agrarian Party) has been a kind of median party in government, being represented in almost all political governments.<p><p>Government coalitions may be large, and their compositions politically unconventional. For example, the largest right-wing party, the conservative National Coalition Party, was in government with two left-wing parties from 1995 to 2003; this was repeated in the Government formed in 2011. Also new parties have been added to the established system and have made their way into Government. For example, the small Finnish Rural Party (SMP), characterised by criticism against the “old parties”, was welcomed into the Government from 1983 to 1990 following its success in the elections. The Green League, which made its way into Parliament in 1987, was in the Government from 1995 to 2002 and from 2007 to 2011, and also in the Government formed in 2011. The populist “True Finns” party – the historical successor of the Finnish Rural Party – caught up with the three biggest parties in popularity in the 2011 elections. The “True Finns” participated in the coalition negotiations but decided to stay outside the new Government. After all, Finnish parliamentarism is nothing if not adaptable, pragmatic and absorbent.<p><p>From 1982 to 2012, all Presidents of the Republic came from the Social Democratic Party. Before that there had not been a single president of left-wing provenance. In 2000, Tarja Halonen became Finland’s first female president and served two six-year terms. In 2012, Sauli Niinistö of the moderate conservative National Coalition Party was elected president. He was re-elected in 2018.<p><p>In Finnish parliamentarism, the Government is the preparatory and executive body that produces material for Parliament to consider, approve or reject. The material is submitted to the President twice, but normally no conflicts arise between the President and the Government, or between the President and Parliament. A conflict between Parliament and the Government may lead to the Government’s fall. Since the 1980s, governments have been so strong that the opposition has had no way of toppling them. Constitutional reforms have strengthened progress towards majority parliamentarism. Indeed, governments usually sit for the whole of their four-year term. Parliament is highly dependent on the bills submitted to it by the Government. The Government has to report continually to Parliament in many ways on what it is doing and where it is going, but it controls the day-to-day political agenda.<p><p>Finland has been a member of the European Union since 1995. Membership has given Parliament and the Government new obligations and new roles, which every now and then revive the question of their relationship with the President, who leads the country’s foreign policy in cooperation with the Government. The Prime Minister’s role has become stronger along with the EU membership, plus the backing of constitutional reforms and long-lived governments. Through the Parliamentary Grand Committee, Parliament has access to EU matters being prepared by the Government, and any stand taken by the Grand Committee is politically binding on the Government.<p><p>In the type of party-based and consensus-oriented parliamentarism practised in Finland, political coalitions may be large and unconventional in composition. Interparty relationships may overshadow formal institutional ones. Decision-making requires the formation of coalitions and the acceptance of compromises. Nowadays, Finnish politics is characterised by pragmatism and a strong penchant towards consensus – factors that have not always been present. This situation limits the degree of freedom that parties have to articulate their ideologies or programmes and implement them.<p><p>Finnish parliamentarism is characterised by great flexibility, particularly in building coalitions to form the Government. This becomes evident before the elections in that the parties do not declare beforehand with which parties they are ready to form the Government. In practice, the Government is formed between those parties that can agree on a joint Government Programme. The Programme is more than a mere declaration presented to Parliament as a government statement at the beginning of the Government’s term in office. It is a plan of action containing objectives that the Government has determined it will achieve.<p><p>The political rhythm in Finland is set by parliamentary elections held every four years and presidential elections held every six years. Whereas even the new Constitution does not recognise the fact, parliamentarism receives some of its energy and dynamism from the ever-alert news media, from pressure groups and from the internationalisation of politics and the globalisation of the economy.<p><p>By Jarmo Laine, senior science counsel, Academy of Finland, April 2015<p><p>Constitutional basis<p><p>Parliament<p><p>The Government and the President<p><p>The Parties<p><p>Summary<p><p>Political parties elected to Parliament in 2015 (2011)<p>", "time": "2015-04-23T06:55:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

It earned that distinction by granting equally to all men and women the right not only to vote but also to stand for election.<p><p>The Finnish Parliament celebrated its centenary in 2006 and 2007. Why did the anniversary cover two different years? Universal and equal suffrage was enacted in Finland in 1906, and the first elections for the new unicameral Parliament were held in 1907.<p><p>At that time Finland was still an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian empire, but it became independent ten years later, in 1917. Since that time the country has lived through two world wars and the Cold War, and become a member of the European Union.<p><p>The duties of the organs of state and their division of power have changed, but the system of parliamentary representation stretching back more than 110 years has proved its durability throughout all these periods. Parliament embodies the Finnish democratic ideal.<p><p>Parliamentary reform brought about a major upheaval in political life. For the first time, the right to vote was extended to include all of the country’s adult citizens, irrespective of gender, class, wealth or position. The number of people entitled to vote increased ten-fold. The previous legislative assembly, the Diet, had represented only 15 percent of the male population, and women had had no political rights whatsoever. Finland was the first country in Europe to allow universal and equal suffrage. All adult women were eligible to stand as candidates in national elections in Finland, the first in the world.<p><p>The powers of the state in Finland are vested in the people, who are represented by Parliament. Parliament enacts Finnish law, decides on matters such as the state budget and approves international treaties.<p><p>The parliamentary system still broadly functions along the principles adopted 110 years ago, although there have been changes in the way candidates are nominated, in legislative periods and in voting methods and procedures.<p><p>Parliament contains 200 seats, and parliamentary elections affecting all 200 seats are held every four years; 2019 is an election year.<p><p>The Finnish President, who is the head of state, is elected every six years, local councils every four years and members of the European Parliament every five years. This means that there may be elections nearly every year in Finland (for example: local council elections in 2017, presidential elections in 2018, parliamentary elections in 2019 and European Parliament elections in 2019).<p><p>Finland has a multiparty system. Eleven parties are currently in Parliament: the Centre Party (48 representatives), the National Coalition Party (38), the Social Democratic Party (35), Blue Reform (18), the “Finns” Party (17), the Greens (15), the Left Alliance (12), the Swedish People’s Party (10, counting one representative from the semi-autonomous Åland Islands) and the Christian Democrats (5), Movement Now (1) and the Citizens’ Party (1).<p><p>One feature of the multiparty situation is that no single party is likely to win an absolute majority in parliamentary elections, so the country invariably has a coalition government that enjoys the confidence of Parliament. The government is usually headed by the leader of the largest parliamentary party, who serves as prime minister. The present prime minister is Juha Sipilä, leader of the Centre Party. Blue Reform and the National Coalition Party form the other members of the Sipilä Government.<p><p>The parties, and constituency associations consisting of at least 100 people, adopt candidates in each electoral district, of which there are 13.<p><p>Members of Parliament are elected from each electoral district in proportion to the population, with an average of roughly one MP for every 26,000 people.<p><p>A bird’s-eye view of the parliamentary debating chamber.Photo: M. Ulander/LK/Parliament<p><p>The largest and most populous electoral district is Uusimaa, comprised the municipalities surrounding the capital, Helsinki. It elected 35 MPs in the last elections.The smallest electoral district is Åland, a semi-autonomous archipelago in the Baltic Sea, which sends one MP. The distribution of MPs among the electoral districts varies with changes in the population. The maximum number of candidates that each party or constituency association can put up in an electoral district is the same as the number of MPs that are to be chosen from that district.<p><p>The parties receive subsidies from the public purse in proportion to their number of seats in parliament. They use the money to pay their election costs, the expenses that arise from implementing democracy.<p><p>Forthcoming elections are publicised on street advertisements, in newspapers and on radio, television and social media. Voters actively follow the party leaders’ election debates and use internet-based election engines to search for suitable candidates.<p><p>However, Finnish election campaigns are fairly restrained in comparison with those of other countries. Large public meetings and vociferous election rallies are rare.<p><p>Election day is always a Sunday, and polling stations are open from 9 am to 8 pm. Advance voting forms an important feature of the Finnish parliamentary and presidential election systems. It allows voters to cast their ballot during a designated period before the actual election day. Post offices serve as polling stations for advance voting. Every citizen who has reached the age of 18 by election day is automatically entered in the electoral register. Arrangements are made to enable people who are disabled or hospitalised to vote.<p><p>Everyone entitled to vote is sent notification of their polling station’s location. Polling stations are usually in schools or public libraries and voters do not have to go far to vote. Voting is by secret ballot and each voter’s identification is checked.<p><p>The local election committees, which are elected by local councils and are responsible for election arrangements, conduct a preliminary count of the votes at the polling station.<p><p>The results of elections are usually known within an hour after the polling stations close. The results are determined using the d’Hondt system.<p><p>The most important task of Parliament is to enact laws. Bills usually come before Parliament as a government proposal or, more rarely, as a member’s bill. First, a preliminary debate is held on the government proposal in plenary session, after which it passes to one or several committees for further consideration.<p><p>A ‘corridor of power’ in the parliament building.Photo: Simo Rista/Parliament<p><p>Parliament has 14 permanent special committees concerned with different areas of policy and they can make changes to a legislative proposal or reject it completely. Being a member of a committee is therefore the most important way MPs can exert influence.<p><p>After the committee stage, the proposal goes before two plenary sessions of Parliament where it undergoes first and second readings. In the first reading the bill is initially debated in general terms and then in detail; if necessary a vote is taken on the contents of the sections of the law.<p><p>In the second reading the proposal is either approved or rejected. It takes two to four months to handle most proposals in Parliament; urgent matters can be passed in a matter of days, while major bills can take several years to pass. Government bills and initiatives lapse if they have not been approved by the end of the legislative period. Plenary sessions are open to the public, whereas committee meetings are mainly closed. The public, the media and international visitors can follow parliamentary proceedings from the visitors’ gallery in the debating chamber. Only Finnish members of Parliament are allowed to make speeches in the chamber – visiting dignitaries, including heads of state, make their speeches in other prestigious premises.<p><p>The working ethos of the Finnish Parliament is reserved and dignified; emotional debates, provocative speeches, shouting and heated exchanges do not form part of its tradition. The opening of Parliament at the beginning of February is a solemn occasion with a staid, formal dress code.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, April 2006, updated August 2018<p><p>Women and men from across the country<p><p>Election day arrives<p><p>Powerful special committees<p>", "time": "2011-12-16T09:51:00+00:00", "type": "life"}

Every citizen aged 24 and over, the humblest maid and crofter included, was allowed to vote.<p><p>In those days people made their way to the nearest village – in many cases on skis across the hardened snow of early spring – to put a red line in the box of their choice on a ballot paper.<p><p>Finland had been a Grand Duchy of the Russian empire since 1809. During that period there was a legislative assembly, a Diet, in Finland but it had very limited powers and comprised only male representatives of the upper levels of society, and it convened infrequently.<p><p>After Russia’s defeat in the war against Japan, internal political opposition against the imperial tsarist regime increased. This unrest spread to Finland, where a general strike began at the end of October 1905. As a result of the unrest, the tsar issued a manifesto which decreed that a Parliament based on universal suffrage would be established in Finland with powers to ensure the legality of the measures taken by the country’s Government.<p><p>Preparations for parliamentary reform started right away and the principle that the right to vote and to stand for election would be granted to both men and women was approved right from the start of the process. The Diet convened to approve the reforms on June 1, 1906, and elections were ordered to be held in the spring of the following year.<p><p>Several months were needed for the preparations as the parliamentary reform signified a major upheaval in the whole political arena. The parties of the time were mainly debating societies and discussion groups but they began to reorganize in readiness to exert political power, and several new parties were established.<p><p>It took just under a year to organize polling stations, election committees, vote counting procedures, nomination of candidates, and to provide citizens with information on how to exercise their right to vote.

The Social Democratic party was the largest, winning 80 of the two hundred seats. The moderate, conservative Old Finns party won 59 seats, but the parties in power at the time fared badly. The progressive, bourgeois Young Finns won 26 seats and the Swedish Party 24. The Agrarian Party, predecessor of today’s Finnish Centre Party, took 9 seats and the Christian Workers’ Union was left with 2.<p><p>Of the total of 62 women candidates, 19 (9.5%) were elected to the first Parliament, most of them representing the Social Democratic Party. The success of women in the first parliamentary elections can be regarded as good, since the number of women elected was lower on several occasions during the years before the Second World War.<p><p>The new deputies were summoned to in Helsinki for the first time at the end of May 1907. The opening session of Parliament was held on May 25, 1907 in the assembly hall of a building, since demolished, belonging to the fire brigade in Hakasalmenkatu, a street now named Keskuskatu.<p><p>Much was expected of the new parliament; the air was thick with a sense of national identity and the euphoria of nascent self-determination. The work of the reshaped Parliament was begun by a man, the likes of whom had never been seen before in the corridors of power.<p><p>He, the oldest Member of Parliament, Mr I. Hoikka, a tenant farmer from Lapland, started his speech with the words “As a simple peasant from the furthest reaches of Lapland…” and went on to appeal to MPs to seek consensus despite differences and incompatibility among the parties and the recent passionate election campaign.<p><p>Elections 1907: a rural polling station in Ylihärmä, W Finland.Photo: National Board of Antiquities<p><p>The first session of Parliament lasted three months. Its significant achievements included an act on working hours for bakeries and a law prohibiting alcoholic beverages, issues backed by the workers’ movement and women’s groups. The prohibition law, however, did not actually come into force till more than ten years later.<p><p>Many proposals failed to progress through Parliament, such as legislation on land tenancy, business practices, disability and old-age insurance, and compulsory education. Legislative reforms in many key areas were only passed after Finland became independent in 1917.<p><p>The Tsar, who had the power to approve laws, considered Finland’s rising political activism a threat and left some laws unratified. The Conservatives, who advocated a policy of Russification in the autonomous regions, gained power in Russia.<p><p>In 1908, the Tsar issued a decree that made the procedure for dealing with matters concerning Finland less favourable for Finland. This triggered a storm of protest, as a result of which the Tsar dissolved Parliament and ordered new elections.<p><p>The first Parliament managed to sit for barely a year of its three-year term.
