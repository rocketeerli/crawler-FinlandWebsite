Alhopuro started investigating whether she could use mushrooms in her art and discovered that the undersides – especially of toxic mushrooms – offered “a whole new, exciting colour palette.”<p><p>She arranges them to form patterns or images, then takes a picture “before it gets dark and before snails and birds attack it.” She assembles the artworks near forest paths “for random passers-by to enjoy,” and believes it may add “a bit of mystery and wonder to their day.” Her steadily growing following on Instagram and Facebook seems to agree.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Mr Trumpet Worm (Г-н Трубный Червь), 2017 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Mushrooms on Snow (Грибы на снегу), 2017 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Calavera Amanita (Голова мухомора), 2018 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Like a Moth to a Flame (Как бабочка к огню), 2018 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Natural Palette (Натуральная палитра), 2017 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Come Dine with Me (Пойдём поедим), 2018 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: In a Hurry (В спешке), 2017 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Do a Little Dance (Потанцуем), 2018 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Burning Love (Горячая любовь), 2018 г.<p><p>Саара Алхопуро: Freedom (Свобода), 2017 г.<p><p>Alhopuro has found inspiration in the work of environmental artists such as Andy Goldsworthy.

Her professional career started in 1983, when she won the first-ever Golden Accordion competition and began studying folk music at the renowned Sibelius Academy in Helsinki.<p><p>Kalaniemi has become a revered musician not only because of her versatility, but because of her original playing style. Her playing is highly distinctive, flowing like a gentle creek or a breeze in the trees. It has been compared to the passionate Portuguese vocal style called fado.<p><p>Kalaniemi herself calls her compositions “bellow songs” that she creates by “painting landscapes of feeling.”<p><p>“It’s something I understood as a child,” she says. “I saw the emotional reaction my family had when listening to Finnish schlager [a type of pop music] and accordion tunes, and that made a magical impression. That’s when I realised that this was my soul music, the kind of tradition I would carry in my heart for the rest of my life.”<p><p>The accordion has a peculiar history in Finland. The instrument arrived in Finland in the mid-1800s, and in the beginning of the 1900s, the common people embraced it as a primary accompaniment instrument for different festivities. On the other hand, the accordion’s sound was considered too rough for highbrow society, and it was even banned from churches for a while.<p><p>Despite this reputation, you can almost consider the accordion the founding instrument of Finnish popular culture. It was featured in countless popular recordings and films up until the 1960s, when its position was challenged by rock and roll.<p>", "time": "2018-09-06T12:04:26+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "Helsinki’s Amos Rex reaches new heights and new audiences - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/helsinkis-amos-rex-reaches-new-heights-and-new-audiences/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Amos Rex is an art museum chosen by the BBC as one of Europe’s most innovative new architectural spaces for 2018. It’s located in Lasipalatsi (Glass Palace), an iconic 1936 functionalist-style building lined with tall windows.<p><p>Lasipalatsi also houses offices, shops, restaurants and the renovated Bio Rex movie theatre. Amos Rex helps the edifice reach new heights.<p><p>Or actually, new lows: something is going on below the surface.<p><p>Designed by Helsinki’s JKMM Architects, Amos Rex’s 2,170-square-metre (23,350-square-foot) exhibition hall is underground. Because Lasipalatsi has protected status, they couldn’t construct a new building behind it on Lasipalatsi Plaza, which served as a bus terminus until the early 2000s.<p><p>Amos Rex has a subterranean, versatile exhibition space.Artist’s conception: JKMM Architects<p><p>Instead, several domes of various sizes now adorn the plaza – the public is free to walk and climb on them. Each dome includes a conical appendage topped by a round window that lets daylight into the room below.<p><p>The architects preserved a clock tower in the middle of the plaza. A smokestack in a previous life, it now helps tie the outdoor space together and houses part of Amos Rex’s air ventilation system.<p><p>On budget and on schedule for its August 30, 2018 opening, the privately funded 50-million-euro project helps create a new museum district for Helsinki. Amos Rex is located on the capital city’s main thoroughfare, Mannerheim Road, across the street from the silvery grey hull of Kiasma, Finland’s leading museum of contemporary art. Also nearby is the neoclassical Ateneum, the country’s premier museum for fine art.<p><p>Lasipalatsi occupies a prominent place on Mannerheim Road. Amos Rex’s main entrance is the same as that of the cinema, Bio Rex.Photo: Tuomas Uusheimo<p><p>Kai Kartio, CEO and director of Amos Rex, says the adjacent museums will not compete with each other, but instead will work collaboratively to accentuate their geographical proximity as a means to attract patrons. He projects 200,000 visitors for Amos Rex in its first full year.<p><p>Helsinki Art Museum (HAM) and Kunsthalle Helsinki are also both within a few hundred metres of Lasipalatsi – the former in another renovated, late-1930s functionalist building, Tennispalatsi (Tennis Palace).<p><p>Since 1965, Amos Rex had, as the Amos Anderson Art Museum, occupied the stately home of Amos Anderson (1878–1961), a Swedish-language newspaper publisher, art collector and member of Finland’s parliament. Known for its 19th- and 20th-century collection of Finnish art, the museum was no longer viable in the 105-year-old structure.<p><p>“It is a very charming old house, but not practical at all,” Kartio says. “It was not possible going forward.”<p><p>In the museum and cinema lobby: It’s a good thing they never got around to demolishing Lasipalatsi.Photo: Tuomas Uusheimo<p><p>In the early 2010s, when the search began for a new home, nearby municipally owned Lasipalatsi stood out for its availability, central location and appeal as a city treasure.<p><p>Purpose-built for the 1940 Helsinki Summer Olympics (delayed by the Second World War until 1952), the low-slung, block-long Lasipalatsi was meant to be torn down after a few years and replaced by a taller building. As a result, three young architects were given carte blanche to design the structure as they wished in the popular functionalist style of the times.<p><p>Its demolition delayed for many years, Lasipalatsi fell on hard times in the 1980s, eventually becoming protected and gaining modernist masterpiece status from the preservationist organisation Docomomo International. Yet despite its aesthetic appeal, Lasipalatsi had become a financial burden for the city of Helsinki, which was eager to work with the art museum’s deep-pocketed foundation. The city kept some of the commercial space housing restaurants and shops, while Amos Rex now controls most of the building.<p><p>“We like it because it is absolutely central,” Kartio says. “We wanted to make it as accessible as possible, as easy to visit as possible, and everybody knows where it is.”<p><p>An aerial evening view shows Lasipalatsi Plaza casting beacons of light into the darkness.Artist’s conception: JKMM Architects<p><p>At one point the Bio Rex movie theatre had stopped operating for a few years, but Amos Rex has restored it to its original splendour, reupholstering the 590 seats within the art-deco cinema. Visitors go through the theatre lobby to reach the museum’s main entrance. Movies, mostly independent and art-house, are scheduled largely on weekends. The theatre can accommodate film festivals and seminars, and is available to the public as a rental hall.<p><p>Excavation beneath the public square began in 2015 to create a domed hall that will give Amos Rex flexibility to display forms of experimental and interactive art, Kartio says. With skylights atop the domes bringing in natural light, the space mimics the modernist lines of Lasipalatsi.<p><p>Amos Rex features rotating exhibitions of contemporary and experimental art, as well as classical and 20th-century modernism. From time to time the Amos Rex will also exhibit ancient art, says Kartio.<p><p>By Michael Hunt, August 2018<p><p>Using interactive art, teamLab investigates human behaviour in the information era.Photo: teamLab<p><p>Amos Rex’s grand opening exhibition is created by the Tokyo-based teamLab, a 500-person art collective that includes not only artists, but also coders, animators, mathematicians, architects, graphic designers and writers.<p><p>They say they’re out to “reconfigure reality” by investigating human behaviour in the information era.

{"title": "Tiny Finnish town wins World Capital of Metal crown - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/tiny-finnish-town-wins-world-capital-of-metal-crown/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The race ran for most of May and June 2018. Metal bands and their fans could add bands to the Capital of Metal website and increase the numbers for their hometowns.<p><p>Two frontrunners eventually emerged, both of them eastern Finnish locations. Joensuu or Lemi, which one would win the Capital of Metal? It was tight until the very end, with both contestants encouraging their local bands and fans to go online and participate.<p><p>Joensuu went so far as to create cat memes to promote the cause. But in the end it became clear that the winner was the tiny municipality of Lemi, located 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the Russian border.<p><p>The World Capital of Metal contest is based on Finland’s fame as the country with the greatest number of metal bands per capita in the world (53.2 bands per 100,000 inhabitants). Lemi won the competition with 13 bands and a theoretical ratio of 422.6 bands per 100,000 inhabitants, whereas Joensuu (population: 75,848) came second with 177 bands and a ratio of 233.4 bands per 100,000. In absolute terms, Joensuu has the greatest number of bands of any Finnish municipality.<p><p>The capital of Finland, Helsinki, came up with 123 bands, equivalent to just 19.4 bands per 100,000 inhabitants. During the campaign Helsinki requested help from Tallinn, the capital of nearby Estonia, but even this double metal metropolis, nicknamed Hellinn, still had only 154 bands – fewer than Joensuu.<p><p>Guitarist Rolle Hirsimäki (left) of Lemi band Kasvoton (Faceless) says, “Stam1na has shown that it’s possible to make good music and become popular even if you come from a small town.”Photo: Simo Sairanen <p><p>So how did the rural municipality of Lemi become the World Capital of Metal?<p><p>“Music has always played a big part in peoples’ lives in Lemi,” says Jussi Stoor, the town’s mayor. “For example, people here have sung four-tone hymns for ages.” Stoor received the honorary title Mayor of Metal at the official Capital of Metal award ceremony on the main stage of the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in Helsinki on June 30, 2018.<p><p>“I was really surprised, although I knew lots of people in Lemi make music,” says Rolle Hirsimäki, a guitarist from Lemi. “Maybe there’s more room for music in the countryside, since there are not as many other activities there.” His band Kasvoton (Faceless) plays extreme death metal. It was formed in 2010, while the four members were still in school in Lemi.<p><p>Both Stoor and Hirsimäki name one metal band from Lemi that has set an example for youngsters for more than two decades: Stam1na. “There is lots of music other than heavy metal, but maybe Stam1na being so famous explains why people from Lemi are so into metal,” Stoor says.<p><p>Hirsimäki agrees: “Stam1na has shown that it is possible to make good music and become popular even if you come from a small town.” Lemi has worked closely with Stam1na, even before the Capital of Metal campaign.<p><p>Mayor of Lemi Jussi Stoor, a.k.a. the Mayor of Metal, traversed downtown Helsinki in style on his way to the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival to accept the World Capital of Metal award on behalf of his town. The weather cooperated, despite the ominous clouds.Photo: Miika Storm <p><p>However, Lemi didn’t win the competition just because of Stam1na. Lemi has invested in music and young people, for example by providing band rehearsal spaces to young musicians. According to Stoor, at least half a dozen bands have municipal rehearsal spaces in Lemi. That’s also where Kasvoton started playing. Stam1na still has a rehearsal space in town, too.<p><p>Whereas Lemi has Stam1na, Joensuu holds an annual rock festival, Ilosaarirock, which started in the 1970s – so it has also built a tradition. In Joensuu up-and-coming bands can apply for grants to fund their first European tours. “I have to congratulate Joensuu,” says Stoor. “It’s quite a mecca for metal music. There are lots of bands there. The competition was tough but honest, and I’m glad we all promote this culture together.”<p><p>Stoor and Hirsimäki think winning the competition has something to do with Lemi’s strong community spirit. “The bands were active and joined the campaign,” says Stoor.<p><p>He participated enthusiastically, even shooting a video in response to Helsinki’s call for help from Tallinn. “Because we are small we can’t afford fancy video equipment,” he says in the clip. “But still, we don’t need any help from abroad with metal bands, like some others do.”<p><p>Stoor enjoyed the process: “Helsinki did their video with humor, and so did we.” He says he’s been a metalhead since he was a teenager. “This fits my genre quite well. That’s probably why I got so excited about the competition.”<p><p>Stam1na, a metal band from Lemi, has achieved great popularity. “Maybe Stam1na being so famous explains why people from Lemi are so into metal,” says Mayor Jussi Stoor.Photo: Teemu Leinonen <p><p>“Winning this competition is a big deal for a small community,” Stoor says. “It has brought us a lot of publicity. I’ve seen people say on social media that their next destination is Lemi.”<p><p>Lemi hosts two annual music events, both in late July: Lemin musiikkijuhlat (Lemi Music Festival), with mostly classical, jazz and choir music, and KontuMetal, “the only metal festival in Southern Karelia,” as Hirsimäki puts it. Stoor promises that the municipality is planning more metal. [Editor’s note: Lemi has also announced plans for a special one-day metal festival on September 8, 2018 to celebrate winning the Capital of Metal honour.]<p><p>If you’re planning a trip to Lemi, it’s worth noting that you can rent a summer cottage there, but for a hotel you’ll have to travel to the city of Lappeenranta, a 20-minute drive away.<p><p>By Anna Ruohonen, July 2018<p><p>Lemi loves metal<p><p>Granting support to music<p><p>Next stop: Lemi<p>", "time": "2018-07-04T07:13:24+00:00", "type": "culture"}

(It is already known that Finland itself has more metal bands per capita than any other country.)<p><p>Finnish metal bands could tag an online map of Finland to help their hometowns win the title of Capital of Metal. When the result was announced on June 21, the winner was Lemi, a town of only 3,076 inhabitants, located in southeastern Finland.<p><p>An additional contest on the Capital of Metal site invited musicians and fans from all nations to enter a draw for prizes ranging from music store gift certificates to a trip to Finland, just in time for the Tuska Open Air heavy metal festival in Helsinki from June 29 to July 1. The prize includes transportation, accommodation and VIP festival tickets for two. (See more about Capital of Metal in our article.)<p><p>“I read about the campaign on Facebook”, says Vieira. “It caught my attention and I decided to participate, but I didn’t think I could win. When I checked my email, I couldn’t believe the message saying that I’d won the prize.”<p><p>An executive secretary student at the Federal University of Sergipe in Brazil, Vieira, 20, has been a metal fan since the age of 11, when he fell in love with the music after his big brother Victor Gonçalves introduced him to it. Now Gonçalves is joining Vieira on the trip. (Follow their Instagram feeds here and here.)<p><p>Gonçalves, 30, is a musician and music producer and has visited Finland before. “I used to work on sea cruises and my route passed through Helsinki, so I had the opportunity to see a little,” he says.<p><p>Apocalyptica is one of João Vieira’s favourite Finnish metal bands.

The two have already attended festivals held in Brazil, but are excited about Tuska. “We will see bands at Tuska that I never thought I’d have opportunity to see, like Kreator, Europe and At the Gates,” says Vieira, naming a German band and two Swedish groups. “It will be really exciting for us, moments that we’ll remember for the rest of our lives.”<p><p>The brothers come from Aracaju, the capital of Sergipe, a small state in the northeast of Brazil. Although relatively small (about 650,000 inhabitants), Aracaju is a tourist city of beautiful beaches, famous for the hospitality of its population. It is also said to be the city with the healthiest living habits and the lowest percentage of smokers in the country, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health.<p><p>Vieira says that the local metal scene in his hometown is “very small.” He believes that this may be because bands get little in return for their efforts, leading to a situation that lacks incentives.<p><p>The trip from Aracaju to Helsinki takes 17 hours, but that doesn’t seem to faze Vieira. “It’s my first trip abroad,” he says. “We’ll stay in Helsinki for five days. I hope to see as much as possible.”<p><p>One the Finland’s most famous metal bands from Finland, Children of Bodom is also among the favourites of João Vieira and his brother Victor Gonçalves. This picture shows frontman Alexi Laiho and keyboardist Janne Wirman playing at Tuska Open Air 2017.Photo: Cristina Ornellas<p><p>Vieira’s interest in the Finnish metal scene started many years ago, while watching the famous German festival Wacken Open Air online. “I found the high number of Finnish bands in the lineup curious, and I decided to dig in. I’m a big fan of Children of Bodom, Lost Society, Turisas and Apocalyptica.”<p><p>Asked what sets Finnish bands apart, he says, “Finnish metal is different. The lyrics of the songs are usually very interesting and the sound is heavy but joyful.”<p><p>Besides his passion for heavy metal, he’s also a skateboarder and a surfer. He also likes to read and play the guitar. Through reading he has learned a lot about Finland and expresses his admiration for the education system. “I admire the way that in Finland, the taxes paid by the population return in the form of education, health and quality of life,” says Vieira.<p><p>By Maila-Kaarina Rantanen, June 2018<p><p>From northeastern Brazilian to southern Finland<p><p>Finnish metal is different<p>", "time": "2018-06-26T09:17:09+00:00", "type": "culture"}

She currently lives in London.<p><p>Her first musical love was punk; later she got into heavy metal. She never intended to become a photographer with a strong focus on metal musicians; it happened by coincidence.<p><p>Appearances form a big part of metal music culture, with makeup and costumes meant to go a tad over the top.

The first magazine to publish Korhonen’s photos was a Finnish subculture magazine called Toinen vaihtoehto (Another Alternative).<p><p>“I didn’t even get paid for them, but I was so excited,” she says. “Wow, they published my photos!”<p><p>Later, she got a job at Finnish music magazine Rumba, where music photography officially became her thing. Eventually, she moved to London to expand her career. Some of the biggest UK papers, such as NME and the Observer, have published her work.<p><p>“If I was to name a favourite among the photoshoots I’ve done,” says Korhonen, “it would probably be the one with Motörhead’s Lemmy Kilmister. He was charismatic, and he was also always friendly when I saw him, even if he didn’t talk much. He would remember you, too.”<p><p>She also doesn’t hesitate to name her favourite Finn to photograph: Ville Valo.

Once, at a photoshoot with Australian death metal band Thy Art Is Murder, the person booked to play a corpse didn’t turn up. Finally, Korhonen’s assistant had to step into the role.<p><p>“Only her feet were visible in the shoot,” says Korhonen, “but she was very reluctant to do it, as she happens to hate her feet.”<p><p>At a Brixton Academy gig in 2014, bassist Troy Sanders of American metal band Mastodon reaches out to shake hands with Finnish photographer Tina Korhonen.Photo: Giora Hirsch<p><p>If Korhonen gets to choose the music, she’s likely to play Mastodon, Monster Magnet, or some classic Black Sabbath.

A website called Capital of Metal proposes to answer that question, or rather to let the bands and their fans provide the answer, because they’re the ones whose opinions matter. Finland might be the only country where metal music and its creators enjoy such a high level of appreciation, respect and, well, let’s just say it out loud: love.<p><p>Bands are going online to add themselves to a map of Finland. They also get to tell the world about themselves and their hometowns, in their own words. The organisers, who include Helsinki’s renowned Tuska Festival (the name can be translated as “agony”), Sony Music Finland and music shops such as Musamaailma and Record Shop X, hope that between May 9 and June 20, 2018, as many as possible of Finland’s thousands of metal bands will check in and put themselves on the map.<p><p>Those thousands of groups, and heavy metal music in general, have incalculable hordes of fans throughout the land – and across the globe. Metal enthusiasts from all countries can visit the Capital of Metal website to “like” their favourites. (Full disclosure: Capital of Metal is also supported by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which produces ThisisFINLAND.)<p><p>And there are prizes. When all is said and sung, winning the Capital of Metal title is about more than just bragging rights: that city gets its own stand at Tuska Festival, a prime opportunity to show the world why they won and cement the reputation of their municipality and its musicians. [Editor’s note: The winner is the southeastern town of Lemi, with a population of 3,076 and 13 metal bands, meaning that there are 42.26 bands per a hypothetical 10,000 people. The runner-up, the eastern city of Joensuu, posted an impressive 177 bands, but with a population of 75,848, the number of bands per 10,000 people only reached 22.34.] <p><p>The bands who tagged the map entered a draw for music shop gift certificates, while the fans who frequent the site had a chance to win a trip for two to Tuska, complete with VIP access.

Or maybe it’s all of the above, and more. We’re not the first to notice – this isn’t even the first article on this website to mention it (see links below).<p><p>One Finn who is eminently qualified to explain is Toni-Matti Karjalainen, who currently serves as a research fellow at Aalto University’s School of Business in Helsinki, where his specialties include management of music and culture export. A multidisciplinary academic with degrees in design and economics, he’s also the driving force behind an annual event called the Modern Heavy Metal Conference, which started in 2015 and, by no coincidence, is held in Helsinki the same week as Tuska Festival.<p><p>Presentation topics at the conference have included “Why focus on Finnish heavy metal for research in philosophy of music?,” “Exodus to the ‘promised land of heavy metal’: How an international presence has impacted the metal scene in Finland,” “Death/doom metal as part of Yorkshire, England,” “Folk metal as heritage music: An example from Java” and “Finnish mythology in heavy metal.”<p><p>Karjalainen has travelled the globe attending metal concerts and interviewing fans, and he’s had a chance to think about what Finnish metal means to the rest of the world, and vice versa.<p><p><p><p>Why is Finland the Capital of Metal? Because of Tuska Festival. Video: Capital of Metal<p><p>“Tonally, the Finnish language fits very well with the metal environment,” says Karjalainen, and makes a rhythmic noise to demonstrate. Finnish is a “consonant-driven” language, he says, and “fits well with the other instruments.” Anyone who has tried to learn Finnish has noticed the proliferation of double consonants.<p><p>Many Finnish bands sing in English, of course, but “if a band sings in Finnish, it’s weird, unique and sort of exotic” for foreign listeners. Karjalainen looked at the audience when Mokoma and Stam1na, two bands who sing in Finnish, played their first concerts in Japan, and, surprisingly, “the whole front row was singing the lyrics out loud.”<p><p>According to Karjalainen, the lyrics in question “are not very self-explanatory, even to a Finnish speaker.” If Finnish metal music can motivate fans to learn, by heart, lyrics that they can’t comprehend, it speaks volumes about the appeal and pull of the music.<p><p><p><p>Why is Finland the Capital of Metal? Because Obama says so. Video: Capital of Metal<p><p>Going beyond the rhythm of the language, other factors have allowed Finnish metal to grow, and may have helped shape its sound, although there is no one single Finnish sound. The term “heavy metal” covers a seemingly limitless list of genres and subgenres: black metal, doom metal, folk metal, glam metal, goth metal, melodic death metal, power metal, pagan metal, speed metal, symphonic metal and more.<p><p>There’s Finnish nature, referring to the natural environment of Finland, and there’s the nature of the Finns, meaning their personality and society. All of this contributes to Finnish metal music.<p><p>“Over and over again, if you talk with the artists,” says Karjalainen, they mention that musicians who grow up in places where winter is marked by long nights and severe weather tend towards “melancholy chords.” If you’re a teenager with a guitar, “you don’t start forming a new salsa band.” While this line of discussion risks running afoul of stereotypes about Finland, “it probably holds true on a general level,” he says.<p><p>It’s common to hear Finnish designers and artists mention how they are influenced and inspired by the natural world – Finnish forests and lakes, and materials such as birch wood – and this also comes up when talking about metal music. More than 70 percent of Finland is covered by forest, and a similar proportion of Finnish metal album covers feature bands posing in forests.<p><p>Musicians don’t wish to be stereotyped, however, and Finnish groups often gain recognition for their individuality “in terms of concepts or technical know-how,” says Karjalainen. Nightwish and Children of Bodom are two bands that enjoy such acknowledgement and played an important role in paving the way for other groups when Finnish metal really took off during the late 1990s and early 2000s.<p><p><p><p>Why is Finland the Capital of Metal? Because even our lullabies are metal. Video: Capital of Metal<p><p>Finnish society has also played a part in allowing metal to develop. All types of music have benefitted from the inclusion of music education in Finnish primary schools. “If you talk to people who work in the music industry or play in the bands, they’ll say that this did have an influence on the overall acceptability of music, because most young people have tried an instrument at some point,” says Karjalainen. “You sense a positive atmosphere towards music in our country.”<p><p>While metal is “not necessary regarded as mainstream” in Finland, he says, it hasn’t been perceived as anti-establishment, either. Finnish society has greeted the metal scene with a degree of acceptance better than that of many other countries, where heavy metal may be forced into an underground existence. It is still a subculture – not every Finn is a metal music expert – but it’s a large subculture.<p><p>Within the metal scene, too, there is far less infighting between subgenres than in many other nations. “Everybody’s happy and we’re friends,” says Karjalainen.<p><p>By Peter Marten, May 2018<p><p>Check out Capital of Metal’s website, campaign videos, city videos, Facebook page and Instagram account, and the Modern Heavy Metal Conference website.<p><p>Finnish metal flourishes<p><p>Appeal and drive<p><p>Influences and inspiration<p><p>Everybody’s happy<p>", "time": "2018-05-08T22:37:28+00:00", "type": "culture"}

I think we’ve learned to play jazz together, and sometimes when we play, I’m blown away by the fact that we can actually both improvise together in the moment. That’s very rare.”<p><p>Given how easy it is to access practically any music in the world online nowadays, it’s no surprise that Mäkelä and Kuloniemi say that they are far from jazz purists.<p><p>“My range is wide, from Clean Bandit to Count Basie, and from Tom Waits to Egotrippi,” Mäkelä says. “I also play in a pop group, and I would say that I’m first and foremost a songwriter.

All practitioners, from amateurs to professionals, learn the necessity of trusting and supporting each other; it’s an integral part of circus activities.<p><p>“Finland has a strong youth circus culture where social inclusion plays a key role,” says Mäkelä. “Lessons are available for all age groups, and have also been used as a means of social integration with specific groups of people, such as immigrants.”<p><p>The whole process of seeking and gaining a place in the inventory has strengthened cooperation between circus groups nationally. “CircusInfo Finland, Sirkus Finlandia and Arts Promotion Centre Finland [known by its Finnish abbreviation, Taike] invited all representatives of the field to join in the talks,” says Mäkelä. “The process has brought the different circus practitioners closer together, which is wonderful, and beneficial to all.”<p><p>Similar elements are visible in the culture of the Kaustinen folk fiddling style, in which playing music is a communal event that unites the whole village.<p><p>A collective effort is necessary to get a heritage element onto the list, whether it is circus culture, a musical style or any of the other entries that currently make up the inventory, including everything from lace making to glassblowing, and from the Finnish connection with the forest to the unflatteringly expressed “stinginess of the people in Laihia.”<p><p>Many of the inventory’s elements receive coverage elsewhere on this website: sauna bathing; the declaration of Christmas Peace; the national poet Runeberg; the tradition of visiting cemeteries on Christmas Eve; the resurgent lawn game known as mölkky; Everyman’s Right, which lets everyone share the land; the Finnishness of Santa Claus; Finnish tango; and wild food foraging, to name a few. The process continues: Although the previous round closed in 2017, the opportunity is reopening at a later date, in 2019 at the earliest.<p><p>At the Kaustinen Folk Music Festival, fiddler and music educator Mauno Järvelä (middle left) and other teachers lead several hundred children in front of a large audience at the main outdoor stage.Photo: Risto Savolainen/Kaustinen Folk Music Festival<p><p>While Finnish circus culture is relatively young, Kaustinen folk fiddling style goes back a long way.<p><p>“The tradition stems from the centuries-old pelimanni [folk-musician] culture, so it provides a unique window on the musical culture of 18th-century Finland,” says Matti Hakamäki, director of the Finnish Folk Music Institute, headquartered in Kaustinen.<p><p>The local folk fiddling style has successfully managed to balance between history and modernity, and has survived thanks to a number of dedicated individuals. Kaustinen Folk Music Festival, an annual summer event celebrating the local music culture and other folk music and dance, has been running since 1968. According to Hakamäki, it was a great success right from the start, and hosts approximately 5,000 performers from all over the world every year.<p><p>“Before the festival, a strong regional tradition existed of pelimanni musicians entertaining guests at weddings that would last for days,” Hakamäki says. “Due to changes in societal structure, the tradition started to wane during the ’60s. In order to preserve the culture, they came up with the idea of building a festival around it. Today, the Kaustinen folk fiddling style is as alive as ever.”<p><p>He says that the area’s music is not reserved solely for celebrations. “It is also a fundamental part of local people’s everyday life. They say that there’s a violin in every household in Kaustinen.”<p><p>Mauno Järvelä gives the thumbs-up sign before the Näppärit kids perform at the festival in Kaustinen, showing that a centuries-old musical culture continues in a modern context.Photo: Kaustinen Folk Music Festival<p><p>The National Inventory of Living Heritage also includes kalakukko, a traditional fish pasty of the Savo region; the oral tradition of Finnish Roma singing; and the distinctive woollen sweater design that originates in the west coast town of Korsnäs. Many examples of cultural heritage are associated with a particular locality.<p><p>“Since Kaustinen was such a remote place in the past, its musical culture has been developing at its own pace, brewing slowly with few influences from outside,” says Mauno Järvelä, an esteemed fiddler and teacher who started Näppärit, a Finnish musical education philosophy based on traditional music. Every year hundreds of children participate in Näppärit workshops and in a concert at the Kaustinen Folk Music Festival, helping ensure the future of the music.<p><p>“What makes the Kaustinen folk fiddling style unique is the rhythm, where the latter part of the beat is emphasised,” says Järvelä. “There’s no clear pattern, but the music just swings. As one fiddler described it, ‘Like the whirl of the rapids, it just carries you.’”<p><p>The same goes for many of the elements in the National Inventory of Living Heritage.<p><p>By Mari Storpellinen, April 2018<p><p>All-inclusive in all sorts of ways<p><p>From weddings to festivals<p><p>Cultural heritage, live onstage<p>", "time": "2018-04-20T10:07:56+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Finnish movie rides heavy metal wave onto silver screen - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-movie-rides-heavy-metal-wave-onto-silver-screen/", "review": "", "content": "<p>First question: Why has nobody made this kind of movie in Finland before now?<p><p>After all, the country has more heavy metal groups per capita than any other (see the map included in another of our articles). Finns really love speed metal, glam metal, death metal, doom metal and the other subgenres. Heavy metal is known for its fantasy elements and sometimes ridiculous excesses – which form obvious starting points for comedy.<p><p>The idea of heavy metal as farce is hardly new. Spinal Tap is among the world’s best-loved comedies and cult movies. Jukka Vidgren and Juuso Laatio surely had Rob Reiner’s 1984 parody in mind as they cowrote and codirected their film Hevi reissu (Heavy Trip).<p><p><p><p>Official trailer: In the words of the film’s production company, Making Movies, the band’s trip “includes metal music, vomiting, grave robbing, fake Vikings and the first-ever armed conflict between Finland and Norway.”<p><p>While the inspiration for the movie is clear, what makes Heavy Trip distinctive is its milieu: rural northern Finland, where metal music is more than just a passion for its fans. It’s what sets them apart from the surrounding community, which is quiet, agrarian and downright redneck.<p><p>Vidgren and Laatio’s film doesn’t make fun of anyone, though – except maybe the villain of the story, a smug adult-contemporary pop singer. Pitted against each other are two kinds of music: naïve but sincere heavy metal and the calculated, treacly easy-listening Finnish schlager pop known as iskelmä. The juxtaposition is subjective and exaggerated, of course. Yet the commanding position of these two genres in rural Finland is indisputable. And the two genres do share a taste for melody and sentimentality.<p><p>Like many classic comedies, Heavy Trip is a road movie. The main characters have to leave their small hometown to make something of themselves – or they at least hope that the grass will be greener on the other side of the fence. Their band hits the road to play at a festival in Norway, where they may or may not have been invited to perform. The trip is more important than the destination, though.<p><p>It’s no wonder that the film’s highest-profile coproduction country is Norway. Besides being northern Finland’s neighbour, the land of the fjords is another nation known for its more or less exhilarating metallic excesses.<p><p>When in Norway: The band travels by van, but also by Viking boat.Photo: Harri Räty/Making Movies<p><p>Style-wise, Heavy Trip is a combination of laconic Finnish humour and recklessness, including some rather macabre goings-on. For instance, the drummer suffers, a bit like in Spinal Tap.<p><p>The movie pays tribute not only to its cinematic forebears, but also to the music. Vidgren and Laatio seem to understand and love the aesthetics of metal. The film is never mocking, though it often shows the metalheads’ antics in a humorous light.<p><p>One of the movie’s recurring jokes refers to the wide range of subgenres within heavy metal. “Symphonic post-apocalyptic reindeer-grinding Christ-abusing extreme war pagan Fennoscandian metal,” is how guitarist Pasi (Max Ovaska) describes the group’s sound.<p><p>Pasi, an odd character with an unchanging expression, is in his own way unselfishly sympathetic – and he’s a walking dictionary of heavy metal. In one scene, he announces that he’s changing his name from Pasi to Xytrax. The film’s humour draws on metal’s more extreme phenomena and provocative clichés – for instance, the band is called Impaled Rektum.<p><p>To top it all off, “Heavy Trip” even includes romance.Photo: Harri Räty/Making Movies<p><p>Few Finnish-language movies find large audiences and distributors outside the country. Fittingly, Heavy Trip’s world premiere happened at the leading US festival of music, film and interactive media, SXSW in Austin, Texas. Like this renowned event, the movie takes a multidisciplinary approach to pop culture.<p><p>Finnish viewers may see Heavy Trip as part of a domestic comedy farce genre, whose biggest international success has been Napapiirin sankarit (Lapland Odyssey). Elsewhere, it may be seen as an intriguing mix of Finnish exotica, humorous metal clichés and Anglo-Saxon indie-film mischievousness, bringing to mind the works of Taika Waititi or even Wes Anderson.<p><p>A love story involving the band’s front man, Turo (Johannes Holopainen), and Miia (Minka Kuustonen), a flower shop assistant, is a gesture toward the mainstream, but at least a slight interest in metal culture is essential to fully appreciate the comedy.<p><p>Thanks to an exceptionally high budget by Finnish standards – three million euros – Heavy Trip also includes some surprising action sequences. Due to the extreme views of the pop singer and local authorities, the band members have to escape a trigger-happy Norwegian officer. Impressive explosions set up the film’s grand finale, which takes place – naturally – onstage in front of an audience.<p><p>By Kalle Kinnunen, April 2018<p><p>Distinctive heavy milieu<p><p>Symphonic post-apocalyptic reindeer grinding<p><p>A road movie that travels widely<p>", "time": "2018-04-19T08:16:07+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "The sisu within you: The Finnish key to life, love and success - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/sisu-within-finnish-key-life-love-success/", "review": "", "content": "<p>One of the first things any article about sisu will tell you is that this Finnish word is untranslatable. Authors have been trying to find a parallel in English since at least January of 1940, when the opening paragraph of a full-spread piece in the New York Times ventured, “It is not easily translated, because no other language has its precise equivalent.” The headline read, “Sisu: A word that explains Finland.”<p><p>So how do you write about a country when its description rests upon an untranslatable word? It’s amazingly complicated, and yet also deceptively simple: Writers resort to explaining what sisu means, and in the process they reveal the inner workings of the people and society of Finland – what you might even call the soul of the country. This is what happens when Joanna Nylund takes on the subject in her book Sisu: The Finnish Art of Courage (2018, UK: Gaia; USA: Running Press). [Full disclosure: Nylund has also written and photographed for this website.]<p><p>Etymologically, “sisu” comes from a Finnish root word that implies “inner” or “inside.” This is one reason it is sometimes translated as “guts” or “inner strength.” Finland is a bilingual country; Nylund grew up in Raseborg, a southern town where both Finnish and Swedish are well represented, and she speaks both. (In the far north, the languages of the indigenous Sámi people also have official status.) Regardless of language, however, everyone living in Finland can lay claim to sisu. In addition, people all over the world are showing interest in the concept, as well. Just a few pages into the book, Nylund encourages readers, telling us, “You have sisu,” and, “It is within the reach of everyone. It lies within you.”<p><p>Joanna Nylund conveys insights into Finland’s culture and society in “Sisu: The Finnish Art of Courage.”Photo: Joanna Nylund<p><p>She wrote the manuscript in English. At the time of this article’s publication, the book also appears in or is slated for release in Dutch, French, Hungarian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Vietnamese, not to mention Finnish. The book’s seven chapters allow Nylund to regard sisu, its manifestations and its applications from multiple angles.<p><p>The introduction informs us that, linguistically speaking, the concept of sisu goes back 500 years or more. It can refer to “stoic determination, hardiness, courage, bravery, willpower, tenacity and resilience.” It’s “an action-oriented mindset.” You don’t brag about having sisu; you just “let your actions do the talking.”<p><p>From there, the book branches out – and the definition of sisu further expands, or is further explained – to show how sisu can be applied as what amounts to an all-purpose philosophy of life. It comes into play when you tackle challenges such as fighting a war in the cold of winter, which is exactly what Finland was doing when the Times published its article, but it can also help you confront more common obstacles. It contributes to physical and mental wellbeing and helps you communicate with your partner, family members and colleagues. You can raise your kids to have sisu. You can use it as the basis for leading an active, healthy life, you can leverage it to progress toward your goals, and it might even help you find happiness.<p><p>In the process of illuminating sisu, Nylund also winds up with a well-ordered, engaging cultural guide to Finland. Much of the Finnish way of life and way of thinking either contributes to or is fed by the concept of sisu. If you’d like to emulate the Finnish love of nature, study the famous Finnish education system, admire the Finnish ability to make the most of extreme weather conditions (and have fun while you’re at it), or find Finnish inspiration for dealing with a large or small life crisis – or if you’re just Finn-curious – sisu plays a role.<p><p>The book includes, at regular intervals, tips for how to incorporate a sisu-like attitude into your own life: “Top tips to help you recharge: 1. Truly disconnect, 2. Embrace the silence, 3. Schedule alone time.” Or how about: “Top tips for getting back to nature: 1. Think low-key, 2. Think know-how, 3. Think preparation.” There are even recipes that embody sisu by including foraged ingredients, from blueberry pie to a vodka cocktail with blackberry, basil and lemon.<p><p>Finnish people have been known to think that swimming in icy water is fun and healthy. It does help if there’s a sauna nearby so you can warm up afterwards.Illustration: Naomi Wilkinson<p><p>Did Nylund ever fear she might be extending the definition of sisu too far? If so, the fear was unfounded. “It does cover every part of life,” she says. “That’s what I discovered when I was thinking and writing.” She came to the conclusion that sisu “genuinely underpins a lot of things, and in that sense it wasn’t too much of a stretch to find it in different aspects of life.”<p><p>If you’re interested in Finland, you’re going to run across sisu. “The thought that carries everything [throughout the book] was that we show our sisu by our actions, and that’s why it’s necessary to talk to Finns and describe how we live in order for people to get a grasp of what sisu looks like.”<p><p>In Sisu: The Finnish Art of Courage, Nylund includes interviews with Finns who personify the idea, such as Arctic and Antarctic explorer Patrick Degerman and social activist and sisu researcher Emilia Lahti. Nor does the author forget to mention other examples of sisu, among them Nobel Peace Prize laureate Martti Ahtisaari, known for his work in resolving international conflicts, and long-distance runner Paavo Nurmi, who set records and won Olympic medals in the 1920s.<p><p>Anyone who writes a book like this, with its compact but all-encompassing look at Finnish culture, is bound to become an unofficial ambassador for the country. Nylund is fine with this. She fell into the role, she says, “unwittingly, but not unwillingly.”<p><p>By Peter Marten, March 2018<p><p>Action-oriented mindset<p><p>Running across sisu<p>", "time": "2018-03-08T14:04:39+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Finnish museum brilliantly leverages the art of Donald Duck - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-museum-brilliantly-leverages-art-donald-duck/", "review": "", "content": "<p>“Excuse me, where are the Donald Duck paintings?” The staffers in the galleries of Helsinki’s Ateneum Art Museum heard this question thousands of times over a space of several months. Another thing they often heard is, “I’ve never been to a museum before, but I came to see the ducks.”<p><p>Ateneum negotiated with the National Gallery of Duckburg – or so the story goes – to gain the privilege of exhibiting more than a dozen pieces that show remarkable similarities to classic Finnish artworks in Ateneum’s own collection. The National Gallery of Duckburg exhibition ended on February 25, 2018, but we couldn’t let its runaway success just fade away; our slideshow (below) contains a selection of paintings for anyone who couldn’t make it to Helsinki to see them.<p><p>Duckburg is, of course, the city chronicled in the Donald Duck comic books, which hold a special place in the hearts of the Finns, for reasons we’ll get into shortly.<p><p>The curators intentionally designed the exhibition so that the location of the Duckburg paintings wouldn’t be immediately obvious. They didn’t have their own room. Instead, they popped up throughout the museum near the Finnish classics that they resemble, mostly in Ateneum’s long-term show, Stories of Finnish Art.<p><p>National Gallery of Duckburg created an additional level within Stories, which already contains many layers of meaning. Stories covers a period from the early 1800s to the late 1900s and is arranged salon-style, each wall a constellation of paintings hung close together. Finnish classics and lesser-known works appear side-by-side with those of foreign artists, inviting viewers to notice how artists influenced each other and how Finland’s art world interacted with movements abroad.<p><p>The Donald Duck pieces added another dimension by echoing their Finnish counterparts.

Photo: Yehia Eweis/Ateneum Art Museum/Finnish National Gallery<p><p>“Duckburg Town Square” by Albert Eiderfelt bears a marked similarity to another composition, “The Luxembourg Gardens, Paris,” an 1887 oil painting attributed to an artist with a conspicuously analogous name: Albert Edelfelt. Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/National Gallery of Duckburg<p><p>One of the great things about art is that everybody can devise their own interpretation and find an entry point. “That’s a park in Paris,” says a man to his daughter, who is perhaps six years old. “No,” she says, “that’s in Helsinki.” “The Luxembourg Gardens, Paris” (1887) by Albert Edelfelt; Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Ateneum Art Museum/Finnish National Gallery<p><p>“Towards Evening and Poverty” is “a masterpiece of Hookbill Simberg’s mature period,” according to the curators. The sea of money shows that “owning three cubic acres of hard currency is a formidable burden.” Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/National Gallery of Duckburg<p><p>Hugo Simberg painted his son walking with the artist’s father in “Old Man and Child” in 1913 with “an exceptionally subtle and sympathetic quality,” as the wall placard tells visitors.

Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/National Gallery of Duckburg<p><p>Akseli Gallen-Kallela’s “Lemminkäinen’s Mother” (1897) shows a story from the Finnish national epic, “Kalevala,” in which “the warrior and womaniser Lemminkäinen dies because he has tried to kill the swan of Tuonela,” as the exhibition info says. Photo: Jouko Könönen/Ateneum Art Museum/Finnish National Gallery<p><p>Audubon Gander-Kallela’s “Donald Duck’s Uncle” shows the artist’s “elemental avian romanticism and perceptive portraiture,” as the curators put it. The painting also shows subtle but readily detectable influences from Akseli Gallen-Kallela’s “Lemminkäinen’s Mother” – or is it the other way around? Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/National Gallery of Duckburg<p><p>“Kullervo cursing,” painted in 1899 by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, recounts another “Kalevala” story: the slave Kullervo becomes enraged and sets out for revenge. Photo: Pirje Mykkänen/Ateneum Art Museum/Finnish National Gallery<p><p>Audubon Gander-Kallela’s work “Kullervo’s Fowl Mood” is “inspired by the avian romantic ideal of primitive woodland as the cradle of Duckburgian culture” and depicts “a lone duck’s war cry in the battle with the wider world,” say the curators. Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/National Gallery of Duckburg<p><p>Ferdinand von Wright’s “The Fighting Capercaillies” (1886), like many of the Finnish paintings echoed in the Duckburg exhibition, is one that most Finns immediately recognise. Photo: Yehia Eweis/Ateneum Art Museum/Finnish National Gallery<p><p>“The Fighting Waterfowl,” by Ferdy von Wren, “presents an archetypal love triangle in a sylvan setting,” with cousins Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander courting the same maiden, and is “bursting with dramatic tension,” according to the wall placard. Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/National Gallery of Duckburg<p><p>The dynamics of the Stories exhibition changed with the addition of Donald Duck characters. “Popular culture and high culture are constantly crossing paths,” says Ateneum chief curator Teijamari Jyrkkiö.<p><p>As she describes it, placing Duckburg within Stories highlighted “how our classics stay vital through the years; how other artists borrow from them, too; how popular culture makes use of works of fine art; and how dialogue is always going on.”<p><p>Mixing Donald Duck with Finnish classics is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Aku Ankka, as he’s called in Finnish, has achieved lasting strength and popularity stemming from the Aku Ankka comic book, which has been around since 1951. It is the most popular weekly publication in Finland, and also has a larger circulation than the country’s leading monthly consumer magazines.<p><p>Many Finns remember Aku Ankka as one of the first things they read by themselves, if not the first thing. “Teachers have been known to tell their pupils, ‘If you don’t read anything else, at least read Aku Ankka,’” says Jyrkkiö. Educators feel comfortable recommending the comic book because it maintains high language standards. Some stories are translated and some are Finnish originals, but all use impeccable, lively Finnish. They also often tie in with current events in Finnish society.<p><p>There you have it: An internationally famous American cartoon character known for speaking in incomprehensible quacks on screen paradoxically occupies a role as an enduring champion of written Finnish.<p><p>Arvid Le Loon’s perceptive depiction of “Gus Goose at Work” shared the wall with other portraits and self-portraits at the Ateneum Art Museum.Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>When Aku Ankka editor-in-chief Aki Hyyppä tentatively approached Ateneum, the museum welcomed his suggestion: From a previous project, the comic book’s publisher possessed a couple Donald Duck versions of famous Finnish paintings – how about hanging them in Ateneum? Museum director Susanna Pettersson and her colleagues thought it was a great idea; they even commissioned additional pieces.<p><p>“Since the works refer to Finnish classics,” says Jyrkkiö, “we could put them in the galleries beside our own classic works, encouraging the public to compare the Duckburg art with our collection. That provided a new way of capturing the interest of children and young adults, and of anyone who doesn’t usually go to the museum but likes Donald Duck.”<p><p>The museum is always interested in getting more children, more families and more men to visit (women tend to outnumber men in the statistics).<p><p>The Duckburg show, which opened on October 3, 2017, proved a great success. From January to September of that year, Ateneum averaged 30,000 visitors a month, 4,400 of them children. For the month of October, the count was 48,393 visitors, 12,307 of them children. Over the duration of the exhibition, which lasted just less than five months, the museum received 245,688 visitors (almost 70 percent more than the pre-exhibition average), including 49,786 children.<p><p>The exhibition handout, a single sheet of thick paper, the size of a large postcard, listed the Duckburg artworks. It became a treasure hunt, especially good for all the kids. If one of the goals of art is to inspire reactions and conversation, Donald Duck’s presence at Ateneum brought many new voices to the discussion.<p><p>By Peter Marten, February 2018<p><p>Donald’s Finnish role as Aku<p><p>Youthful inspiration<p>", "time": "2018-02-20T10:59:57+00:00", "type": "culture"}

In time, he was considered one of their successors.<p><p>Starting in 1841, Topelius made a career as a journalist, writing factual pieces and serial stories for the Swedish-language newspaper Helsingfors Tidningar. The publication’s circulation grew enormously during his tenure there.<p><p>In 1854 he was appointed to a professorship in Finnish history at the Imperial Alexander University in Helsinki. Much later he served as rector of the university.<p><p>He is known today as a prolific writer of poetry, prose and children’s books. Two public sculptures in his honour were unveiled in the Finnish capital in 1932. One, by Ville Vallgren, stands across from the Design Museum and shows the author reading with several girls and boys. The other, by Gunnar Finne, is located on the Esplanade and portrays two female figures representing truth and fiction.<p>", "time": "2018-01-09T13:32:03+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "In Finnish climate change film, the future still exists - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-climate-change-film-future-still-exists/", "review": "", "content": "<p>What can one person do? Why doesn’t everyone feel like I do? What can we do now for the future? British Finnish director John Webster asked himself these questions while planning and filming the documentary Little Yellow Boots: A Story for the Future. An unusual climate change movie, it makes a wide range of viewpoints readily accessible by placing interviews alongside a story Webster tells about his own family.<p><p>“Sometimes there’s a film subject and there’s this inner need to make it,” said Webster to a DocPoint Festival audience in Helsinki. Planning for Little Yellow Boots began in 2010 and the editing process concluded a few days before the American presidential election in November 2016. That event’s repercussions, such as the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, have only made the film even more topical.<p><p>Recognising that climate change is essentially connected with loss, Webster includes details in the film of how, at the age of 12, he lost his father to a stroke. He talks to his mother and his wife. He also invents Dorit, his own hypothetical great-granddaughter, born in 2063.<p><p>He intersperses his own story and his messages to Dorit with appearances by environmentalists, coal miners, researchers, scientists and others. By showing something as universal as a family, and by placing several generations of his own relatives in the movie, Webster encourages audiences to empathise with the all the different people in the film and to be receptive to its discussion of climate change.<p><p><p><p>Watch the trailer for “Little Yellow Boots: A Story for the Future.”<p><p>The boots of the title belong to Dorit, and they reappear throughout the movie in shots where a new water level is superimposed on present-day footage: a North Carolina neighbourhood with streets, lawns and fire hydrants below the waterline, or a half-submerged car parked under a highway overpass in New York City.<p><p>“What will your world look like the year you are born, about half a century from now?” Webster’s narrating voice asks his great-granddaughter. “When I was born there were three billion people. You will share this planet with nine billion. Your world will also be warmer than mine by about two degrees. It doesn’t sound like much, but it is significant on this watery planet.”<p><p>From there, he sets out to see what the world will look like in the future, to find out who will be affected by climate change and to observe how people are reacting in the 2010s. He covers a lot of ground, from the Arctic islands of Svalbard to the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.<p><p>He attends a UN Climate Summit in New York. He takes a train across the US with a group of activists, and also crosses Russia by rail to talk to coal miners in Siberia, engaging passengers in conversation as he goes.<p><p><p><p>“Nature itself is telling us to use [coal],” says miner Alexander Chunaryov in the Kuznetsk Basin region of Siberia.Photo: Tuomo Hutri<p><p>While making Little Yellow Boots, Webster says he found himself asking (and here he switches to an exaggerated voice, like a comedian imitating an actor in a Shakespeare play), “Why? Why don’t they see it like I do?”<p><p>Some of the people we meet in his film do seem unworried by the damage being inflicted on the environment. This influenced his approach. “I thought it was healthier to turn the question the other way around,” he says. In other words, why doesn’t he feel like those other people?<p><p>This mind-set leaves him open to a wide variety of viewpoints. “Nature itself is telling us to use [coal],” miner Alexander Chunaryov tells him in Siberia, implying that, otherwise, there wouldn’t be so much coal within relatively easy reach.<p><p>Another miner, Alexander Klimov, says, “We’re building something more important than clean air: society. And the next generation will find a way to clean the air.”<p><p>Some of the coal from the region helps power Webster’s own city in Finland, he notes in a voiceover as we see an aerial view of a train, a river and an open-pit coal mine, each of them cutting a path through the landscape. On board the train, he tells a man called Mikhail, “I’m making this film for my great-granddaughter in the future, because I’m worried that her world will be worse than mine and there is something I could do about it and I’m not doing it.”<p><p>Mikhail, who is a great-grandfather himself, replies, “I think you are overestimating yourself in this respect.”<p><p>Making “Little Yellow Boots” allowed director John Webster to address his hypothetical great-granddaughter, Dorit, born in 2063.Photo: Tuomo Hutri<p><p>Is there anything one person can do? Many of the people Webster meets are trying. He covers the UN Climate Summit of 2014 in New York during a speech by poet Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner, who comes from the Marshall Islands, a Pacific nation severely endangered by sea level rise. She recites a powerful poem in the General Assembly, moving the dignitaries to a standing ovation.<p><p>In an interview, she tells Webster, “What am I going to do, tell [my baby daughter], Give up?…You want to believe that things will get better.” Her poem includes the line, “We deserve to do more than just survive.”<p><p>On the train across the US, Webster talks with African American activist and grandfather Carl Anthony about not giving up. By “allowing despair to enter into your psyche,” Anthony says, “you end up hurting the people that you love the most” – your family. He’s here, he explains, because his ancestors didn’t despair during generations of slavery. “They found within themselves whatever it took to maintain the hope.”<p><p>Webster is careful to tell me that he’s not comparing his own setbacks with those of African Americans. However, Anthony’s philosophy still fits the subject. “Throughout the film, different people talk about family, the next generation, what you pass on,” says Webster. “You cannot necessarily see now where things will go.”<p><p>He wants Little Yellow Boots to inspire discussion. The even-handed film presents the challenges of climate change, drawing viewers into the conversation without concealing the sobering facts.<p><p>“If you are watching,” he says to Dorit in his voiceover, “the one thing I would most want to tell you is that I thought about you, Dorit, and the world you will live in.” Spoiler alert: Webster isn’t giving up. Before the closing credits, he tells her, “I am hopeful for you and your future.”<p><p>Refusing to give up is a step in the right direction.<p><p>By Peter Marten, November 2017<p><p>Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, airs Little Yellow Boots: A Story for the Future on November 20, 2017; the film is streaming on Yle Areena starting November 15 (where available; Finnish title: Tulevilla rannoilla).<p><p>What will your world look like?<p><p>It’s not like the world goes on forever<p><p>One person out of many<p>", "time": "2017-11-07T20:28:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

At close to 60,000 students per grade, this means that approximately 180,000 children will participate while between the ages of 13 and 15. With these numbers, Art Testers professes to form the biggest art review in the world.<p><p>Solving the logistical challenges is the responsibility of a nationwide network of coordinators from the Association of Finnish Children’s Cultural Centres. One of them is Helsinki-based Siiri Oinonen.<p><p>“Art Testers came about in celebration of Finland turning 100 in 2017,” she says. The country gained independence in 1917. “When the Finnish Cultural Foundation was first established in the 1930s, youngsters went around collecting donations door-to-door. The capital they raised formed the core of the foundation, and this project is a way of giving something back to young people.”<p><p>Knowing where to draw the line: Students from Meilahti Upper Secondary School went to see “The Red Line,” a theatre performance by Timo Ruuskanen (left) and Tuukka Vasama of the Red Nose Company.Photo: Tero Ahonen<p><p>In autumn 2017, eighth-graders from Meilahti Upper Secondary School in Helsinki attended Punainen viiva (The Red Line), a theatre performance by Red Nose Company. In the spring the students are travelling to another theatre event in Lahti, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of the capital.<p><p>Art teacher Marita Brace appreciates the scope of the project: “I often take my students to galleries, but they have chosen to study art and are motivated. Art Testers, on the other hand, allows students with little or no previous experience of art to engage with it. It’s also very equal, since students from regions with fewer cultural options get to travel for an art experience – sometimes quite far.”<p><p>Funding for Art Testers comes from the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the Swedish Cultural Foundation in Finland. A survey by the former found that 97 percent of schools would go to art institutions more often if it was cheaper.<p><p>Eighth-graders Jenna, Pihla and Aada have all enjoyed being part of Art Testers. “It’s nice to have learning experiences outside of school sometimes,” says Pihla. Although all three are experienced theatregoers, it was a positive new experience to see something they didn’t choose themselves.<p><p>From left: Jenna, Pihla and Aada line up with their teacher, Marita Brace, in front of a row of easels in their school’s art classroom.Photo: Joanna Nylund<p><p>“The play was…different,” says Jenna, and smiles. “A little hard to understand, but also interesting for that reason. It made me think.”<p><p>Aada agrees: “The actors wore clown masks the whole time, and that was interesting because it made me use my imagination more, to fill in the blanks.”<p><p>Before an event, students receive material to prepare them for what they are about to experience. Afterward, teachers are free to continue processing reactions with the students. However, the main focus is on giving feedback online.<p><p>After attending an event or exhibition, the teens fill out a quick survey on the Art Testers website, which receives praise all around. “They seem to understand what appeals to this age group,” says Brace.<p><p>The students agree. “The survey questions felt relevant, like what our mood was afterwards and if we’d consider going back,” says Pihla. They were also satisfied that giving feedback online didn’t require a lot of additional writing on their part.<p><p>A group of teenage students listen to a guide reveal the secrets of Eero Järnefelt’s “Under the Yoke (Burning the Brushwood)” from 1893, one of Finland’s most famous paintings, during an Art Testers excursion to Helsinki’s Ateneum Art Museum.Photo: Jani Kivelä/Art Testers<p><p>The results are displayed in animated graphs on the Art Testers public website. Under “What feelings did the art inspire?” a heart fills with colourful stripes corresponding to choices such as “happiness,” “whatever” and “peace,” each accompanied by a percentage.<p><p>Students can also write additional comments. Ranging from “Really loved it” to “I fell asleep,” the comments provide interesting reading.<p><p>Oinonen hopes that the art venues involved will make use of the feedback when planning future events. “One of the purposes of art is to raise questions, to help us feel and think new things,” she says. “These events all have adult audiences in mind. We have, of course, made sure that the subject matter is suitable for eighth graders, but we are not dumbing anything down. We want to challenge the students a little, but also make it easier for them to seek out art on their own.”<p><p>Aada, Jenna and Pihla all recommend Art Testers. “I really appreciate art and would like others to have the chance to discover it as well,” says Jenna.<p><p>By Joanna Nylund, November 2017<p><p>Seeing red<p><p>Filling in the blanks<p><p>Inspiring questions, feelings and thoughts<p>", "time": "2017-11-01T09:34:14+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The idea took shape in her mind over a long period of time before she put it into practice.<p><p>Lindgren comes from Sweden, and studied dance in the Netherlands and Israel before moving to the southwestern Finnish city of Turku in 2014. A modern dancer by education, she also works in physical and visual theatre.<p><p>In line with recent trends in modern dance, Lindgren is interested in integrating movement and dance into situations and places where they have not traditionally been experienced or seen.<p><p>“I’m fascinated by the connotations of activities linked to daily chores,” says Lindgren. “Few people see anything noble in cooking, vacuuming or dishwashing. They are necessary tasks to which people give no conscious thought.”<p><p>Lindgren wants to integrate playfulness and motion into these routine tasks. She has held a workshop centred on kitchen jobs, and she is planning workshops about other household chores. In addition to this, she publishes an English-language podcast so listeners can try various HDP exercises in their own kitchens.<p><p>A related installation by Lindgren is included in the New Performance Turku Festival in autumn 2017.<p><p>“All kitchen activity starts with the items found there,” she says. “I encourage participants to examine their kitchen with fresh eyes, and to play with routines in a new and different way.” For example, what does it feel like to chop vegetables or knead bread dough if you devote conscious attention to the movements? In her podcast, she calls this “the choreography of the kitchen.”<p><p>“All kitchen activity starts with the items found there,” says Lindgren. She encourages people “to play with routines in a new and different way.”Photo: Pia Bartsch<p><p>Although kitchen and cleaning routines have traditionally been regarded as women’s work, Lindgren does not consider women the sole target group for her project. In the future, workshops may be organised for chopping wood or other chores that are traditionally thought of as manly tasks. Originally, household chores were strenuous, physical work that supported the family and was fundamental to getting through everyday life.<p><p>Lindgren wants to ponder the meanings assigned to everyday tasks. We carry and unpack shopping bags and move items, some of them heavy, but we do not think of this as exercise or working out. “Instead, we drive to the gym to lift weights,” she says. “What is the difference between these things?”<p><p>In addition to the practical significance of household chores, a dance artist can see in them an aesthetic value similar to that of dance.<p><p>“I feel that as an artist, dancer and choreographer I have the opportunity to say and show that daily routines are beautiful and meaningful.

Does inspiration or discipline keep you going?<p><p>A: I’d say it’s a combination of both. I’m a very disciplined worker, but I do get bored pretty easily, so in order to keep myself motivated and inspired there needs to be an element of discovery and play in my work process. Inspiration often comes to me when I’m working with unfamiliar materials or learning a new skill.<p><p>Q: How important is Helsinki Design Week for Finnish artists and gallery owners?<p><p>A: Being the biggest design event in the Nordic countries, it is without a doubt one of the most important and comprehensive design-related events in Finland. It offers amazing exposure for Finnish designers both nationally and internationally, but it also brings designers closer to their customers, which is great!<p><p>Q: What’s your next project?<p><p>A: I’m making some cover art for a British band and designing surface patterns for clients in Sweden, the US and Japan. Lately I’ve also been dabbling with 3D, which is super inspiring and totally new for me. In the future I hope to make more illustrations and patterns mixing 3D elements with my organic and dreamy surface designs.<p><p>Working is about “passion and curiosity,” says Finnish designer Matti Pikkujämsä.Photo courtesy of Matti Pikkujämsä<p><p>Q: How do you go about creating art?<p><p>A: My way of working is about passion and curiosity; most of my work is sketchbooks, made only for me. I see inspiring things all the time and that gets me into a good working mood. I enjoy working. As a portrait maker, illustrator or pattern maker I am a humble servant. I want to make people happy, but not in an obvious way.<p><p>Q: How would you like to see Helsinki Design Week develop in the future?<p><p>A: My image is that it could keep going and expand into unexpected places that normally aren’t reached by Finnish design. It should not be just in design shops but anywhere. I hope people could start to see “design” as thinking, not only as decoration. And that goes for designers as well.<p><p>Q: What are you working on now?<p><p>A: Now I’m making a book and products called Cup of Therapy. My husband and I started the Instagram blog in May and it is expanding very fast. The book will be published by Otava in October and we’ll have products like T-shirts and mugs very soon.<p><p>Speakers at DesignCommons include (from left): Marko Ahtisaari of Sync Project; Winy Maas of MVRDV; Alex Groves and Azusa Murakami of Studio Swine (Super Wide Interdisciplinary New Explorers); and Cees van der Veeken of LOLA Landscape Architects.Photo: World Design Weeks Summit<p><p>Q: What does it mean for Finland to be president of the World Design Weeks network?<p><p>A: We can be proud of the recognition, but at the end of the day it’s all about how well Finnish designers learn to utilise the international network. Design weeks gather a wide range of stakeholders: city authorities, universities, NGOs, designers, manufacturers, retailers, media and local consumers. World Design Weeks is an enabler for Finnish designers to make valuable connections.<p><p>Q: How do you feel about what you’ve achieved since the beginning of Helsinki Design Week?<p><p>A: We don’t tend to look back that much. We have drawn a big picture in which we see ourselves as partners to the industry and other stakeholders. Every achievement is a result of these partnerships. We are dependent upon content like fresh initiatives and novel products which the industry produces.<p><p>Q: What do you think about the future?<p><p>A: There are some trends that I am not excited about. The spectres of populism, nationalism and protectionism loom larger than ever. Creativity and innovation oppose these trends.

Attendees will mix with other fans, listen to world-renowned authors and see the presentation of the Hugo Awards, the top prizes in the genre.<p><p>Fans will also have the opportunity to learn about the thriving Finnish scifi and fantasy scene, which has matured and developed in recent years.<p><p>“There used to be this idea in Finland that good literature had to be realistic fiction,” says Ben Roimola, editor of the Enhörningen fan magazine. “Johanna Sinisalo shattered that barrier.”<p><p>Sinisalo won the Finlandia prize, Finland’s highest literary honour, for her fantasy novel Not Before Sundown. She coined the term “Finnish Weird” for domestic scifi and fantasy and has since been joined by a long list of writers to succeed in international markets.

I’m not that interested in messages either,” she says. “But I am a feminist, and an environmentalist, and a humanist, and all my values are reflected in what I write.

{"title": "Finnish documentary builds dialogue, not division - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-documentary-builds-dialogue-not-division/", "review": "", "content": "<p>In 2015, European countries received record numbers of asylum seekers fleeing Syria, not to mention Afghanistan, Iraq and others. The situation grew to dominate headlines, and Finland was no exception.<p><p>In the first four months of 2015, the Finnish Immigration Service received 1,354 asylum applications. In the last eight months of the same year, 31,123 applications were submitted. Although far from the totals seen in many other countries, the volume caught authorities off guard.<p><p>This situation formed the background for novelist, journalist and documentary filmmaker Elina Hirvonen’s decision to temporarily abandon her other projects and start a film about the unfolding migrant situation in Finland. Boiling Point even-handedly lets people from all viewpoints have their say. The audience witnesses demonstrations for and against migration and hears from Finnish people with a wide range of perspectives. It also follows several asylum seekers as they navigate life in Finland.<p><p>For Hirvonen, the idea became clear in early February 2016. “I woke up one night after reading news about petrol bombs and thought, why is nobody making a film about this?” she tells me. “And then I just thought, OK, why don’t I do it?”<p><p>At a demonstration, an activist who is also a dedicated ice hockey fan lends someone some change.Photo: from “Boiling Point,” produced by Mouka Filmi<p><p>In the incident she’s referring to, a man in his mid-20s threw five bottle bombs at an asylum seeker reception centre in Petäjävesi, a 4,000-person municipality in central Finland. No one was injured.<p><p>The attack fit into what Hirvonen had noticed about public discourse over 2015: “It was rapidly changing in an increasingly aggressive direction,” she says. “At the same time, I felt…like people were living in completely different worlds in terms of how they saw what was happening.”<p><p>She didn’t make Boiling Point to express her personal views, which she has already done as a writer. Her goal was “not to interpret,” she says, “but to leave the audience space to think for themselves, to show the whole spectrum of what’s happening.”<p><p>She sought out people from all walks of life, including villagers in Petäjävesi, activists and many others. “I decided to have the attitude that I’m open to talking with anybody,” she says. “No matter what they say at the demonstrations, they’re all human beings who have some kind of background and life story and experiences.”<p><p>One person who appears in the film is Jarkko, a photographer with anti-immigration political views. “Even though I disagree with him, I felt I understood where he’s coming from and I respect him,” says Hirvonen. “You have to respect the people you’re filming.”<p><p>Elina Hirvonen didn’t make “Boiling Point” to express her personal views, she says, “but to leave the audience space to think for themselves.”Photo: Carl Bergman<p><p>From idea to premiere, production lasted less than 12 months. There’s a certain universality; a similar film could probably have been made in most European countries in 2016.<p><p>Boiling Point elicits strong reactions. Before a showing at Helsinki’s DocPoint Festival, Hirvonen told the audience, “I’ve noticed that the film raises a lot of feelings and questions, including critical ones. I just want to prepare you for that.”<p><p>In order to encourage real off-screen dialogue, the documentary was made available free of charge, via a link, to anyone who wanted to screen it as a public or private event between February and May 2017. The Boiling Point website’s advice page for post-screening discussion says, “The goal isn’t to achieve a common viewpoint, nor is it to argue other people into silence…If everyone talks and listens, everyone’s understanding increases.”<p><p>About 750 screenings happened at community centres, churches, libraries, schools, universities, cafés and restaurants all over Finland. People held events across Europe, not to mention the US, Canada, Peru, Turkey, Afghanistan, Malaysia and Japan. The movie has been seen in Kaamanen, in the Finnish far north, and in Brisbane, on the east coast of Australia.<p><p>By mid-May 2017, an estimated 18,000 people had attended free showings, while 252,000 had seen it on conventional or streamed TV.<p><p>Many different groups use the Finnish flag as a symbol.Photo: from “Boiling Point,” produced by Mouka Filmi <p><p>What kind of dialogue has developed? Hirvonen has attended various screenings, one of them in Petäjävesi, the town that experienced the bottle bombs. About 60 people showed up, including a refugee family that appears in the documentary. The mayor hosted the discussion.<p><p>“It felt like it was…therapeutic for some of them, because their [previous] year was so intense, like most small towns in Finland that took refugees,” says Hirvonen.<p><p>“This one woman said she doesn’t really have any strong opinion, but they have to find a way to get along with each other.” She meant the refugees and the Finns, but also the Finns and the Finns – the natives of Petäjävesi.<p><p>A similar pragmatic sentiment is expressed in the film. Two of the main characters offer living proof that it is possible to disagree and still remain friends. Oula is a historian whose area of expertise is fascism. Tapsa is a businessman who worries about how refugees might affect Finland.<p><p>Tapsa (left) and Oula, here in conversation over a post-sauna drink, remain friends despite their diverging views about politics. Photo: from “Boiling Point,” produced by Mouka Filmi<p><p>They have their conversations at the public sauna, of course. Two guys sitting in a sauna talking politics – could there be anything more Finnish? Wrapped in towels, bare-chested, they discuss their views over a post-sauna drink.<p><p>“What if we Finns started talking to each other respectfully?” asks Oula. “It doesn’t mean we have to agree about everything.”<p><p>Hirvonen returns to these two repeatedly throughout Boiling Point. “A glimpse of hope comes from the idea of Oula and Tapsa in the sauna and the idea of being able to continue the conversation even though they don’t agree,” she says.<p><p>Tapsa, Oula and others interviewed in Boiling Point attended a special premiere prior to the public release. In a question and answer session after a DocPoint screening, Hirvonen recounted the experience.<p><p>“I had been more afraid of that than I’ve ever been of anything,” she said. “But in the end everything went well, and somehow people starting talking with each other and found some common wavelengths. So that was encouraging, because I think that everyone else was also terribly apprehensive beforehand, knowing that the group included people with widely differing positions.”<p><p>[At the time of writing, Boiling Point is scheduled for screenings (mainly film festivals) in Rauma, Finland; Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa; Perm, Russia; Bergen, Norway; Edinburgh, Scotland; Slovakia; and South Korea.]<p><p>By Peter Marten, July 2017<p><p>The whole spectrum of what’s happening<p><p>Feelings and questions<p><p>Screening therapy<p><p>Finding common wavelengths<p>", "time": "2017-07-10T10:27:40+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "Modern women: Finnish art in an eventful era - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/modern-women-finnish-art-in-an-eventful-era/", "review": "", "content": "<p>On a weekday afternoon in New York City, several American women are touring Independent Visions: Helene Schjerfbeck and Her Contemporaries, an exhibition of 55 artworks by four Finnish painters at Scandinavia House on Park Avenue. “Very nice,” says one of the patrons, “but a little depressing.”<p><p>The pieces come from the collection of Helsinki’s Ateneum Art Museum (many of them return to Ateneum in Urban Encounters, showing until January 20, 2019), and some of them do reflect a kind of melancholia that attended the cultural and political transformations as Finland moved, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, toward creating a national identity and achieving independence.<p><p>Art made during the shift away from the Russian Empire and from Swedish influences unavoidably mirrors a tumultuous era during the development of a progressive nation that celebrated its centennial in 2017. The early 1900s included the Civil War in 1918, less than a year after independence, and the Second World War, which the Finns divide into the Winter War of 1939–40, the Continuation War of 1941–43 and the Lapland War of 1944–45.<p><p>In Ellen Thesleff’s “Decorative Landscape” (1910), a female figure is visible in the lower right area of the painting, dwarfed by the trees.Photo: Yehia Eweis/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum<p><p>The creative growth of the celebrated Schjerfbeck (1862–1946) and the exhibition’s other three artists coincided with the notions of equality, cultural development and educational opportunities necessary for the establishment of a sovereign state. Schjerfbeck, Ellen Thesleff (1869–1954), Sigrid Schauman (1877–1979) and Elga Sesemann (1922–2007) weren’t isolated from the political upheaval of the times, either.<p><p>The era’s male artistic giants – notably composer Jean Sibelius, artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela and author Juhani Aho – are often considered to have formed the vanguard of Finland’s cultural and political identity and the drive to create a distinctive Finnish character. However, female colleagues such as the pioneering Schjerfbeck, one of the country’s best-known painters, had a significant role, though it was overlooked at times.<p><p>“Although there were a limited number of academic people at the time, artistic talents rose up,” Risto Ruohonen, general director of Finnish National Gallery, tells me. “A relatively small part of the community had a strong ideological philosophy where politics and art were so closely combined.” These individuals had an influence on both spheres.<p><p>Sigrid Schauman created “Italian Landscape” in the 1930s. All four of the artists in the exhibition lived or worked on the Continent at some point.Photo: Pirje Mykkänen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum<p><p>Schjerfbeck, Schauman and Thesleff came of age as artists during a critical time in the development of an autonomous Finland. Until 1846, there were no Finnish art schools, unified art collections or news coverage of the cultural scene. That was the year the Finnish Art Society was founded (it later gave rise to Ateneum). Soon afterward, grants were established for studying the arts at home and abroad (mostly in France and Italy; all four of the artists worked or lived on the Continent at various points in their careers). The support was made available to all who qualified, in a climate of equality.<p><p>Female Finnish artists began to use their voices during the late 19th century, an unprecedented time in the burgeoning nation’s pursuit of social and educational egalitarianism. It was also a matter of necessity, as the four artists largely supported themselves throughout their lives, notes Susanna Pettersson, director of Ateneum. Schauman, who was also a teacher and a newspaper art critic, accomplished a number of her works after her 70th birthday.<p><p>This Elga Sesemann self-portrait from 1946 depicts the artist without eyes. That may be a sign of the grim realities of the time.Photo: Yehia Eweis/Finnish National Gallery<p><p>The show features Schjerfbeck’s intricate self-portraits, Thesleff’s imaginative woodcuts, Schauman’s lavish landscapes and Sesemann’s introspective expressionist portraits. Part of Finland’s celebration of 100 years of independence, the exhibition started in New York in the autumn of 2017, then reappeared at Millesgården in Stockholm under a new name, The Modern Woman, during the winter of 2017–18. From October 19, 2018 to January 20, 2019, many of the same paintings are on display at Ateneum in Helsinki as part of a larger exhibition entitled Urban Encounters.<p><p>Some of the works reflected the growing pains involved in the creation of a new independent country, and were occasionally brooding portraits of a nation at war. Thesleff’s Finland’s Spring, completed in 1942, portends the optimism of shaking off winter, but also some of the grim realities during conflict with Russia. Sesemann’s Self-Portrait (1946) depicts the artist without eyes. Throughout the exhibition, a sense of Finnish period realism seldom available to American audiences shines through.<p><p>Some struggles via the lens of artists, though, are universal and timeless. “One wants to portray that which is innermost, passion,” Schauman wrote during her career, expressing a goal shared by many of her colleagues.<p><p>She continued the thought like this: “And then you become ashamed and cannot because you are a woman.” Some artistic challenges, we hope, are consigned to the past.<p><p>Full version of Helene Schjerfbeck’s “Self-Portrait, Black Background” (1919) Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum/Hallonblad Collection<p><p>Helene Schjerfbeck: Girl from Eydtkuhnen II (1927) Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum/Kaunisto Collection<p><p>Helene Schjerfbeck: Girl from California I (1919) Photo: Hannu Aaltonen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum/Kaunisto Collection<p><p>Helene Schjerfbeck: Red Apples (1915) Photo: Henri Tuomi/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum/Kaunisto Collection<p><p>Helene Schjerfbeck: Maria (1909) Photo: Yehia Eweis/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum<p><p>Ellen Thesleff: Self-Portrait (1916) Photo: Pirje Mykkänen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum/Hallonblad Collection<p><p>Ellen Thesleff: Marionettes (1907) Photo: Jouko Könönen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum<p><p>Ellen Thesleff: Italian Landscape (undated) Photo: Kirsi Halkola/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum/Kaunisto Collection<p><p>Elga Sesemann: Street (1945) Photo: Hannu Karjalainen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum<p><p>Sigrid Schauman: Model (approximately 1958) Photo: Janne Mäkinen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum<p><p>Sigrid Schauman: Nude (1954) Photo: Pirje Mykkänen/Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum/Antell Collection<p><p>By Michael Hunt, June 2017, updated October 2018<p><p>Issues of humanity<p><p>Climate of equality<p><p>Growing pains, brooding portraits<p><p>Excerpts from the exhibition<p>", "time": "2017-06-27T13:05:08+00:00", "type": "culture"}

That’s when Finland annually celebrates Finnish Language Day and memorialises Mikael Agricola, who was instrumental in creating standards for Finnish as a written language in the 1500s.<p><p>Agricola was born in approximately 1510 and died in 1557. He came from a parish called Pernå in Swedish and Pernaja in Finnish, about 80 kilometres east of where Helsinki is now located – it is not known which language was actually his mother tongue. He grew up to be a learned man – a linguist and theologian, and much later a bishop.<p><p>He lived in Wittenberg, Germany from 1536 to 1539, studying under Martin Luther and others. Agricola’s time there eventually contributed far-reaching effects to religious and literary life in Finland.<p><p>Just as Luther had translated the bible into German, setting the stage for the future of formal German, Agricola translated the Old Testament into Finnish, together with Martin Teit and other fellow Finns who were studying in Wittenberg. Agricola made a Finnish version of the New Testament later, after moving back to the southwestern Finnish city of Turku, and also translated and wrote other texts related to religion. One of his publications, a primer called Abckiria (ABC Book), is considered the first piece of literature in Finnish.<p><p>So the next time you are trying to decide which one of the Finnish language’s at least 15 grammatical case endings is your favourite one to spell, or the next time you are admiring the architecture of a Lutheran church in a Finnish town, you can think back five centuries to Mikael Agricola, whose life’s work helped set the scene.<p><p>By ThisisFINLAND staff<p>", "time": "2017-04-08T23:43:19+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Time spent alone can be a great source of empowerment and strength.<p><p>Finnish people’s love for their alone time is an essential part of their culture, as is their need to regularly spend time walking in the woods or by the shore. As a landscape photographer, Lagerstedt has found these traits inspirational to his art, as he usually works by himself and takes pictures of the natural world.<p><p>It’s important to note that being alone and being lonely are two different things. Finns understand that you can be alone and happy at the same time, though this idea sometimes requires some explanation for people who originate in other cultures. While being lonely tends to be harmful to any individual in the long run, choosing to be alone every now and then provides the Finns with something positive, a meditative time to unwind and charge their batteries.<p><p>The “Alone” collection “can give people comfort and an experience of beauty,” says photographer Mikko Lagerstedt.Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Lagerstedt has published numerous collections of landscape photography, one of them specifically on the theme of solitude. It is aptly called Alone. He transforms a certain atmosphere or feeling into visual art, informed by his Finnish understanding of the need for solitude.<p><p>“I didn’t go looking to portray loneliness or solitude, but the collection kind of came into being of its own accord,” says Lagerstedt. “Those photos are of separate times and places that, in hindsight, seemed to carry a common theme. I came up with the name Alone because the images just seemed to suggest it.”<p><p>Although created by a Finnish photographer in Finland, Alone has gained most of its online viewers from abroad. This suggests that the interest in solitude is not such a Finnish phenomenon after all.<p><p>Someone finds a way through the wilderness in “Strange ways.”Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>“Since being published, Alone has kind of started to live a life of its own, reaching new viewers all over the world with a surprising speed,” Lagerstedt says. “It was the collection that really took off in terms of me being internationally known and recognised.”<p><p>The photo collection features images of seemingly lonesome figures in vast, dark areas: in a forest, on a lake, in a field. The pictures can also be seen as delivering a calm, stress-free atmosphere in serene natural surroundings.<p><p>“To me, the Alone collection is a bit dark, but not in a bad way,” says Lagerstedt. “It can give people comfort and an experience of beauty, perhaps. In my opinion, solitude is meditative.”<p><p>In “Between two worlds,” a small, solitary figure walks through the towering woods at sunset. Does this indicate sensible exercise or a sense of foreboding?Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>When asked what has influenced the beginning of his career as a photographer, Lagerstedt picks one particular experience of his personal life:<p><p>“I lost my best friend suddenly when I was only 20 years old. I cannot say for sure but I’ve got a feeling that that had something to do with me starting to take photographs and getting deeper into photographic techniques. Most of my photos have got an element of darkness to them, and since you are always the result of your past, a great sorrow would inevitably play some kind of lasting role in your life.”<p><p>Whether the tragic incident is behind the atmosphere in the photos or not, the Alone collection is not about sadness and loneliness. It is simply about solitude.<p><p>“Feelings of being alone in this world are just a part of life,” says Lagerstedt, “and maybe they shouldn’t be seen as particularly negative or positive, since they can be both.”<p><p>Ghost bridge Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Night road Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Stranger Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Between two worlds Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Into the mist Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Blizzard Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Moody water Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Strangeways Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>Quiet moment Photo: Mikko Lagerstedt<p><p>By Mari Storpellinen, January 2017<p><p> <p><p>International interest<p><p>The beauty of darkness<p><p>Result of the past<p><p>Nine photos from Lagerstedt’s “Alone” series<p>", "time": "2017-01-13T11:54:36+00:00", "type": "culture"}

According to director Juho Kuosmanen, who has travelled the world this year as his film plays at various festivals, audiences everywhere are responding to it in exactly the same way: The most noticeable reaction is laughter.<p><p>“You often hear people mention how we represent a small language community, and they say humour is something that is deeply connected with the national culture, but I don’t share that view,” says Kuosmanen. He believes that a wide range of movie-goers can identify with the film’s values. “As long as you are not using any overtly specific cultural references, situational humour and emotion can cut across any boundary.”<p><p>“The film industry as a whole is fairly heavily focused on success, and I have a feeling that many of my fellow filmmakers see their own professional circumstances reflected in Olli Mäki’s story,” he says.<p><p>“Just the other day, someone I met in Germany told me that it was like watching his own life’s story on the screen, and a French woman in her nineties put it concisely when she said, ‘That’s exactly how we were.’ It just goes to show you that it’s easy to share in universal emotions such as love, fear and joy.”<p><p>A smiling Finnish man: Director Juho Kuosmanen (standing) laughs with cast members during a break on the set of “The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki.”Photo: Kuokkasen Kuvaamo/Aamu Film Company<p><p>The 1960s can be seen as a pivotal moment for society in many ways.<p><p>“What came up in our conversations when we were writing the script was the film’s portrayal of women, and a number of commentators have also picked up on that point since it was released,” says Kuosmanen. “An American told me that it would have been impossible for women in the 1960s to be as modern as they are in the movie.<p><p>“I don’t always feel a huge sense of pride about Finland, but at that moment I was tremendously proud to be able to say yes, absolutely, Finnish women really were like that.”<p><p>The film features strong women, but Kuosmanen concentrates even more on masculinity and what it means to be a man. This focus is also apparent in the decision to launch the film with different titles at home and abroad. The Finnish name is Hymyilevä mies (The Smiling Man).<p><p>“When I’m travelling abroad, I often have to explain to people why we turned a two-word Finnish title into a long phrase in other languages,” says Kuosmanen. “From a Finnish perspective, a smiling man is considered a rarity, if not an aberration.”<p><p>“This notion [that a smiling man is a rarity] is further highlighted by the fact that Olli Mäki never really matched all the expectations that were heaped on him,” says the director. “Compared with the traditional image of a boxer, he was far too cheerful and good-natured.”<p><p>Against the background of many other Finnish films, Kuosmanen’s portrayal of Mäki is a breath of fresh air. It breaks away from the cliché-ridden representation of Finnish men as melancholy, lacking self-confidence and out of touch with their own feelings.<p><p>Manager Elis Ask (Eero Milonoff, wearing hat) encouraged a great deal of hype around the big boxing match between Olli Mäki (Jarkko Lahti, front left) and Davey Moore (John Bosco Jr, holding flowers).Photo: Kuokkasen Kuvaamo/Aamu Film Company<p><p>A key part of the movie portrays the making of a documentary film about Olli Mäki, shot on the eve of his big match in Helsinki in 1962.<p><p>Kuosmanen shows Mäki’s manager Elis Ask (played by Eero Milonoff) shaping and arranging reality in a manner that wouldn’t be out of place in today’s social media. The characters pretend that Olli lives in a beautiful, photogenic villa. He shadowboxes for the camera and poses for photos with a model so tall that he has to stand on a footstool to match her height.<p><p>The real Ask also worked hard to generate a buzz around the boxing match. The time was ripe for that sort of thing; television was playing an ever greater role in people’s lives, and advertisers were starting to make their moves on the sporting world.<p><p>“Ask had visited the US during his own boxing career,” says Kuosmanen, “and he wanted to import the concept of boxing as a big show to Finland, despite the fact that the public didn’t really have the mindset for it at the time.”<p><p>Although Juho Kuosmanen’s film has been greeted with great success, one of its themes is that winning isn’t the only way to find happiness.Photo: Kuokkasen Kuvaamo/Aamu Film Company<p><p>Kuosmanen had an intense film festival season in 2016, and it took a while yet before he gets to enjoy some well-earned rest. He was championing his movie in the fight for a Best Foreign Language Film nomination ahead of the Oscars in February 2017, but in the end it was not one of the chosen ones.<p><p>How did he feel about entering the fray with a film that claims winning isn’t the only way to find happiness?<p><p>“It is a little amusing I guess, but I don’t really mind, as it wasn’t something we focused on while working on the film. It’s different if you set out to achieve that sort of goal despite the fact that everyone knows that it’s best to stay true to your own vision.” He believes that the film has been so successful because it doesn’t come across as calculating.<p><p>“But you can’t ignore the fact that our film would have been just about impossible to sell if it hadn’t got off to a flying start in Cannes,” says Kuosmanen. “On paper, we had nothing going for us – a Finnish director making his feature debut with a black and white movie about boxing.

A large proportion of the Finnish population separates recyclables such as cardboard, paper, glass, metal and plastic from other household waste. Several Finnish companies are finding new ways to reuse discarded textiles, as well.<p><p>Old rags are recycled into new fibres and fabrics, then new lines of clothing. Fashion designers are showing increasing interest in textile reprocessing, which has spurred the creation of unique designer clothing and accessories.<p><p>In 2003, clothing designer Seija Lukkala had become disappointed in some aspects of the textile industry, where she had worked for more than 13 years. She observed that the amount of textile waste was constantly growing and employees of large textile factories were working in appalling conditions.<p><p>“Seija decided to create clothes and accessories from old clothing and fabrics and founded Globe Hope,” says Miisa Asikainen, who is in charge of international sales at the Finnish company. “She realized that while natural resources were being depleted, the accelerating pace of work life and the disposable culture of the fashion industry were getting increasingly destructive.”<p><p>Muka Va, a company whose name sounds like the Finnish word for “pleasant,” produces sustainable clothing made exclusively from natural fibres.Photo: Samuel Loueranta/Muka Va<p><p>Today, Globe Hope is a world-renowned company whose values focus on ecology, ethics and aesthetics, according to its website. Globe Hope’s fashion collections are sewn from used materials, combining different fabrics. Bags, hats, jewellery and purses are reborn this way, as is clothing such as tank tops, cardigans, dresses, trousers, jackets, coats, raincoats and other items, for both women and men. A pocket cut from a worn-out coat may become part of a fashionable new bag when sewn onto other material.<p><p>Globe Hope’s creations often retain the original brand mark and worn look of the used clothing, providing clues about the time and place it was initially made. For example, one collection used a Swedish army jacket adorned with a production stamp from 1932.<p><p>Recycling clothing decreases the burden on the environment.Photo: Tarja Repo / Lehtikuva<p><p>Finnish designers form part of a growing trend; dressing in apparel made from textile waste has become quite prestigious. This fits with the environmental concerns that continue to make themselves felt in the world.<p><p>In addition to Globe Hope, other brands are also plying their wares in Scandinavia, continental Europe and beyond. Each one has its own approach to today’s sustainability challenges. Muka Va, a company whose name sounds like the Finnish word for “pleasant,” produces women’s and children’s clothing made exclusively from natural fibres. It has met the admission requirements for participation in the sustainability-oriented Ethical Fashion Show Berlin. Another Finnish brand, Papu (the word means “bean”), produces collections of baby clothing made of cotton with Global Organic Textile Standard certification, which sets environmental requirements and social criteria for the entire textile supply chain.<p><p>The Finnish company Pure Waste deliberately forsakes dyes. It sorts textile waste by colour and quality to produce only white, black or grey T-shirts and sweatshirts for men and women. According to its own calculations, Pure Waste has already saved 200 million litres of water – on average, farmers need 11,000 litres of water to grow one kilogram of cotton.<p><p>Based on the amount of water needed to grow a kilogram of cotton, Pure Waste has calculated that it has already saved 200 million litres of water.Photo: Pure Waste<p><p>In the summer of 2016, 12 tons of second-hand textiles departed from the southwestern Finnish city of Turku, bound for the Netherlands. The shipment is part of a pilot programme called Textile 2.0; collection of old clothing and other textiles started at the beginning of 2016. The cargo is recycled in the Netherlands and used for EU industrial needs, especially in the automotive industry.<p><p>Another southern Finnish company, Dafecor, uses textile waste from clothing stores to make other products, decreasing the burden on the environment. “We are saving surplus textiles that would otherwise go to landfills and waste incineration plants,” says Dafecor CEO Risto Saha. “We recycle them into fibres and give products a new life cycle.”<p><p>Dafecor produces parquet flooring underlay, furniture upholstery and, for technical facilities, special carpets that can absorb water, fuel, light oils and chemicals. The products enjoy steady demand.<p><p>“Ecology itself is not the only goal,” says Saha. “It’s part of the greater objective of social, economic and environmental sustainability in Finland.”<p><p>By Anna Liukko, October 2016<p><p>Fabrics with a history<p><p>Repurposing textiles<p><p>New life cycle for old textiles<p>", "time": "2016-10-17T06:51:49+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The 2016 edition maxed out at 25,000 people each day (see slideshow below).<p><p>Everyone who enters Flow passes a squat, square tower that stands just inside the gates. It’s about six metres (20 feet) tall and covered in sheets of plywood. On the side facing the entrance, and on the opposite side overlooking the festival grounds, a screen takes up the top third of the tower. Various all-caps messages appear as part of a six-minute video loop of animated words and pictures. “BEING IS” flashes up, followed by, “MORE THAN HUMAN.” “OBEY YOUR HEART,” pulsates in white on a red screen. “REVOLUTION THROUGH INCLUSION” comes up one word at a time on a yellow background, then the screen switches to purple to display the message “REALIZE THE DREAM.”<p><p>Flow-goers relax and embrace their empathy in a mini-oasis while various festival bass lines thump in the background.Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>Fish made out of pixels swim in from the bottom of the picture and exit through the top. A black feline shape runs in place in the middle of a white screen while the word “RELEASE” flashes. The cat dissolves into a swarm of particles and tiny letters until the screen turns black. The next words to appear are “THE HOPE.”<p><p>“Release the hope,” “Realize the dream,” “Obey your heart” – the outdoor video installation throwing illuminated messages at festival-goers is a collaborative effort by artist Terike Haapoja and author Laura Gustafsson, Flow’s Visual Artists of the Year. People walk past or stop to watch; some splay out in a nearby makeshift garden, where turf has been rolled out to form a lawn. Potted trees and plants placed on stacks of boxes make the area into one of several enchanted oases that contrast with the post-industrial silhouette of the former gasworks a couple hundred metres away.<p><p>The banners that make up “Is the sky painted” decorated a passageway at Flow Festival.Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>The festival mood intensifies as dusk turns slowly to deeper dusk – it’s still summer and the northern days are still long. Thumping bass lines and waves of applause float through the air from four different outdoor stages. In the video, colours that seemed faint in the afternoon sun become richer and sharper as night falls. More details emerge; the lines in the art seem finer. The installation is also within the view of many of the spectators watching the show on the main stage.<p><p>One of the messages that pop up on the screen, emerging from a storm of letters, reads “EMBRACE YOUR EMPATHY.” That is also the name of this piece, which, similarly to Haapoja and Gustafsson’s previous work together, calls attention to animal rights by encouraging human viewers to understand the perspective of animals. A cleverly designed exhibition at Helsinki’s Cable Factory in 2013, bearing the title The Museum of the History of Cattle, documented history from the bovine point of view.<p><p>“LIVE THE ETHICS,” appears on the screen of Embrace your empathy right after “OBEY YOUR HEART.” Coincidentally, the video tower is not far away from a stand selling oat milk under the slogan “Wow, no cow,” and half a dozen of Flow’s thirty-something food booths are completely vegan.<p><p>Words are not enough, but words and modified national flags flutter in “Is the sky painted.”Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>Right beside a row of vegan vendors, another artwork by Haapoja and Gustafsson adorns a passageway leading to the outdoor club-music venue Backyard. Entitled Is the sky painted, it features lilac-coloured banners hanging from the ceiling, each one showing a message or a version of a national flag. “REVOLUTION THROUGH INCLUSION” says the banner at the front of the tunnel, echoing the video at the other end of the festival grounds. Farther in hangs a purple version of the Canadian flag, with a moose where the maple leaf would normally be. In front of the flag, a banner reads “WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH;” the one behind it says, “QUESTION YOUR CATEGORIES.”<p><p>Is the sky painted and Embrace your empathy offer a taste of a bigger exhibition by the same artists: The Museum of Nonhumanity, open September 2 to 29, 2016 at Tiivistämö, one of the former industrial buildings in Suvilahti, the same area that Flow fills with sound, art, food, and fans every summer.<p><p>The gateway: Show your wristband and join the Flow.

The 13th edition, happening from August 12 to 14, 2016, presents the sort of eclectic blend of up-and-coming and established artists that has made the festival famous far and wide. Played on 11 different stages, the musical offerings include indie, jazz, hip-hop, rock, electronic, experimental, and other genres that you can hardly put a name on. An art and design component, curated in collaboration with the University of the Arts Helsinki, shows one-off commissions, installations, and artworks all over the festival grounds, both indoors and out.<p><p>The festival also hosts Flow Talks – discussions with international urban influencers, free to all Friday ticket holders. And as hipsters age inevitably into adults, Flow welcomes children to Family Sunday, a program of interactive performances and workshops for kids and families (1 pm–6 pm).<p><p>Don’t forget about food: Flow is always a feast as well as a fest. True to form, this year’s festival has 39 cuisine vendors – yes, we use the word “cuisine” consciously – including seven all-vegan outlets.<p><p>But here, without further ado, are our top Finnish music picks for this year.<p><p>Photo courtesy of Flow Festival<p><p>We bet you didn’t know that Finland has a thriving reggae scene! Raappana, who comes from the town of Lahti, an hour north of the capital, plays cheerful tunes that make him one of the best-known Finns in the genre. He recorded most of his newest album, Ennen aamunkoittoo (Before the break of day), in Jamaica with local musicians. At Flow, Raappana performs with the New Riddim Crew, a collection of top Finnish musicians. Friday August 12 @ Main Stage, 5:15 pm<p><p>Photo courtesy of Flow Festival<p><p>To say that Berlin-based Jaakko Eino Kalevi is original would be an understatement. He has played everything from reggae to melancholic rock, and his newest album includes elements of electronic psychedelia, folk, and twangy, electronic pop. Jaakko Eino Kalevi has been touring Europe and his concerts can be downright hypnotic, so you probably don’t want to miss his return to Finland. Friday August 12 @ Red Arena, 6:15 pm<p><p>Photo: Andrei Kipahti/Flow Festival<p><p>Actor and singer-songwriter Elias Gould performs soulful guitar-based indie rock. He’s like the reincarnation of Finnish summer in August: beautiful yet already nostalgic, knowing that summer may soon turn into autumn. Friday August 12 @ Factory, 8:15 pm<p><p>Photo courtesy of Flow Festival<p><p>This sweet singer-songwriter’s concert is the perfect way to start your Saturday afternoon. A Swedish-speaking Finn (Finland is officially bilingual), Ronya has released two albums and is often compared to the Swedish star with whom she shares four letters of her name: Robyn.

Just to up the ante, they’re performing with contemporary circus troupe Agit-Cirk. Saturday August 13 @ Main Stage, 5:00 pm<p><p>Photo courtesy of Flow Festival<p><p>Helsinki nightlife wouldn’t be the same without this man. DJ Lil Tony, a.k.a. Toni Rantanen, has been playing Helsinki clubs for over two decades and toured Europe, Japan, and the US. He founded the much applauded clubs Kuudes Linja, Kaiku and Ääniwalli, all located pretty close to the Flow Festival grounds. Lil Tony plays mostly – but not only – house and techno. Saturday August 13 @ Backyard, 9:00 pm<p><p>Photo: Juha Reunanen/Flow Festival<p><p>A somewhat surprising addition to Flow, J. Karjalainen (at centre in photo, flanked by his band members) is a singer-songwriter and rock artist with decades of experience. His discography stretches from his 1981 debut album to a new one released just last year. He’s had different bands over the years, but his comforting sound always shines through – and we, along with countless Finnish fans, love him for that. Sunday August 14 @ Main Stage, 5:15 pm<p><p>Photo courtesy of Flow Festival<p><p>Synth-pop duo Villa Nah is back after a five-year break – and they sound fresher than ever.

As a film location, Finland provides diverse landscapes, four distinct seasons and unique natural conditions; everything is within easy reach of cities and accessible.<p><p>Summertime in Lapland offers impossibly fresh air, wonderful colours, endless daylight and the occasional herd of reindeer clopping leisurely down the middle of the road. In 2014 saw a very different burst of activity in the area, however, when a Bollywood film crew set up shop here to shoot scenes for its latest blockbuster, Shamitabh. Not only did the region host the largest producer of films in the world, but also its biggest star: Amitabh Bachchan.<p><p>“We are very proud at Snapper Films that we got the opportunity to work on the film,” states Juha Wuolijoki, producer and CEO of Snapper Films, the Finnish production company that collaborated with the Bollywood team. “Finland is a perfect location and is a total contrast to the Indian locations of the film. The director, R. Balki, and the producers were excited: we were shooting in June and were able to find snow for the filmmakers in northern Lapland.”<p><p>The seasons boast midnight sun and a cold winter with guaranteed snow. In the north, the low angle of the sun creates a unique lighting ambience and magical hours.Photo: Seppo Saarentola/Otavamedia<p><p>The production employed 30 Finnish crewmembers and an additional 70 Finns working side-by-side with the Indian crew in all departments of pre-production and production. The Director of Photography for the Finnish shoot was Peter Flinckenberg, who has been awarded the prestigious Spotlight Award from the American Society of Cinematographers. This high calibre of expertise extended to the rest of the local team.<p><p>“Finnish crews are very knowledgeable,” states Johanna Karppinen, CEO of Audiovisual Finland, the organisation responsible for promoting the Finnish film and audiovisual industry. “They have this entrepreneurial spirit and multitask much more than in other countries. All the visiting productions praise their attitude.”<p><p>The director of the Shamitabh , R. Balki, and the producers were amazed that they were able find snow for the shoots in Finland in June.Photo: Snapper Films<p><p> <p><p>Similarly, the Bollywood director was extremely satisfied with the filming experience.<p><p>“R. Balki was really, really happy,” Karppinen states. “He said he wants to come back to Finland. Apart from coming to shoot, he would like to bring his family.”<p><p>Shamitabh is just one of many international productions that have been drawn to the Arctic beauty of Lapland over the years, including Julio Medem’s Lovers of the Arctic Circle (1998) and Joe Wright’s Hanna (2011). Meanwhile, Karola Hattop’s Snow Queen (Die Schneekönigin, 2014) was nominated for two German TV Awards.<p><p>The Bollywood film also shot scenes some 900 kilometres south, where the diversity of the Finnish capital continues to attract a variety of foreign filmmakers.<p><p>“There’s really great architecture in Helsinki,” Karppinen says. “There’s different styles: really modern, but also classical and functional. It has a lot to offer town-wise.”<p><p>Nature is not all Finland offers for filmmakers. The efficient working culture, problem solving attitude and excellent infrastructure promote smooth creative work, even in the most demanding conditions.Photo: Erja Raiskila/ThisisFINLAND<p><p>Many renowned directors over the years have agreed. David Lean lensed part of his Hollywood classic Dr Zhivago in Helsinki in the 1960s, and Jim Jarmusch’s Night on Earth (1991) and Peter Greenaway’s Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015) shot scenes here. The nation’s capital has also doubled for the Soviet Union on occasion in the likes of Warren Beatty’s Reds (1981), Michael Apted’s Gorky Park (1983) and Christian Carion’s Farewell (2009).<p><p>While Finland doesn’t currently offer the same rate of financial incentives for filmmakers as a number of other regions, talk is increasing of introducing them in future. Currently, VAT of 24 per cent is deductable, and international co-productions are eligible for considerable production support from the Finnish Film Foundation when a Finnish co-producer is involved.<p><p>“Every year there are several international co-productions with Finland being the main producer,” Karppinen states. “There is also a network of film commissions here who are the experts of each region and who provide free-of-charge assistance in making a visiting film crew’s life easier. They help in finding suitable locations, local crew and services. There’s a lot to discover in Finland.”<p><p>Perhaps the most important of which is the ease in which filmmakers can perfect their craft here.<p><p>“Finland is known for being a country that just works,” Wuolijoki observes. “The airplanes, trains and buses run on time. There are no hidden charges in restaurants. Filming permits are usually easy to get and are inexpensive. The locations are diverse, from Lapland snow, to forests and lakes and cities by the coast.”<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, June 2016<p><p>Shamitabh (India, 2015)<p><p>Eisenstein in Guanajuato (Netherlands, Mexico, Finland, Belgium, France; 2015)<p><p>Snow Queen (Germany, 2014)<p><p>Hanna (USA, UK, Germany; 2011)<p><p>Farewell (France, 2009)<p><p>Lovers of the Arctic Circle (Spain, France; 1998)<p><p>Night on Earth (France, UK, Germany, Japan, USA; 1991)<p><p>Gorky Park (USA, 1983)<p><p>Reds (USA, 1981)<p><p>Dr Zhivago (USA, Italy, UK; 1965)<p><p> <p><p>Local support<p><p>Easy to locate<p><p>Creating incentive<p><p>Notable international productions that have filmed in Finland<p>", "time": "2016-06-17T11:51:16+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Now recently things have changed – both for us and for other guys as well – and it is good to see that it has been noted.”<p><p>‘Black Widows‘ has already premiered across Scandinavia. According to industry gossip in the Hollywood Reporter the American powerhouse CBS has put a remake of the show into development. Lehtinen says much of its broad charm can be traced back to how it was originally created.<p><p>“With ‘Black Widows’ we noticed very early that this is a concept that can have an international appeal,” he says. “So we took that into account when we kept developing it.”<p><p>Lehtinen says they have to spend a lot of time and effort in learning how to work in some of the most complicated markets. One of the toughest countries is America, but it is also one of the most important because of its size. Also, there is no teacher like strong competition.<p><p>“We have learned a lot from selling our stuff in the US: the way they approach concepts, how they package shows and so on,” Lehtinen explains. “We keep that in the back of our minds when we are creating serial drama.”<p><p>International audiences are now blown out by Finnish crime series ‘Black widows’.Photo: Dan Castledine<p><p>“In Finland we have a taste for original concepts and some very interesting stuff gets commissioned,” concludes Lehtinen. “We try to develop shows that have international appeal and world-class storytelling.”<p><p>Some ideas are just timeless.

{"title": "Shaping the future - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/shaping-the-future/", "review": "", "content": "<p>A dynamic new generation of Finnish talent is attracting the attention of top fashion houses, the international press and scouts. Many of the rising stars have one thing in common – they have all been influenced by the pioneering work of Aalto professor Pirjo Hirvonen.<p><p>When Vogue Italia’s head of talent Sara Maino attended Pre Helsinki fashion week, the seasoned senior fashion editor and scout told Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat that she was “amazed.”<p><p>In addition to the bright new talent, what astonished Maino was the exceptional quality of the fashion design programme at Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture. In the past five years, graduating Aalto students have been snapped up by leading fashion houses ranging from Lanvin and Maison Margiela to Marimekko and Balenciaga, have won prestigious industry awards, and garnered attention in magazines ranging from W and Wallpaper to Vogue Paris.<p><p>Yet ten years ago Finnish fashion – with few exceptions – was not a headline-grabbing story in the international design press. What has happened?<p><p>“It originated from us,” answers Aalto professor of fashion design Pirjo Hirvonen. “We’ve developed a bold new culture in which we’re constantly renewing and developing the way we think and operate,” says Hirvonen, who was the head of Aalto’s design department from 2008 to 2015 and led the fashion and textile design programme from 2003 to 2008.<p><p>In addition to a strong network of alumni who hold key industry positions around the world and work closely with the school, there’s a strong learning-by-doing focus that sets Aalto apart from other high-ranking schools in the field such as New York’s Parsons and London’s Central Saint Martins.<p><p>“Our students design and make their own materials whether it’s the printed fabric for a collection or something else,” says Hirvonen. “Students know that if something isn’t available, they can make it. This model is worth gold: not just for this industry, but also as a way to solve problems in any field,” she says.<p><p>Hirvonen’s vision was born largely out of her own experiences as a young designer. After graduating from the University of Art and Design (a predecessor to Aalto University), Hirvonen worked as an in-house women’s wear designer in the ’80s and ’90s.<p><p>“At the time we were trained to create clothing for the Finnish clothing industry.” With globalisation, that domestic textile industry has all but disappeared. Yet Hirvonen says that change was actually a blessing in disguise.<p><p>“It has forced all of us to think in new ways and understand that this is an international playing field – what’s good in Finland is simply not enough,” says Hirvonen.<p><p>As a young creative with many ideas for the international market, Hirvonen was told that her ideas were great, but wouldn’t satisfy domestic customers. “That response was terribly narrowing and crushing,” she says. But it filled her with resolve to turn that kind of thinking around.<p><p>“My core goal when I started with the fashion programme was that the mindset and way of teaching needed to be renewed. Creativity and vision without borders must be encouraged,” she says.<p><p>But good ideas are not enough. A strong business understanding of the global marketplace is crucial. To that end, Hirvonen has been responsible for instituting business management courses as part of the fashion programme, and taken on significant EU projects with other design schools, initiated multidisciplinary studies within the design department, and paved the way for a new sustainability Masters programme.<p><p>“Our students design and make their own materials whether it’s the printed fabric for a collection or something else,” says Pirjo Hirvonen. Photo: Mirva Kakko / Otavamedia<p><p>“We have many visiting instructors who work internationally in the field – all of our work needs to be strategic and operative,” says Hirvonen. “And it’s important to remember that not only the students are the talent – the teaching staff are, too. Talented teachers who understand this industry are essential.”<p><p>The programme’s rigorous selection process features one week onsite, during which applicants tackle a range of assignments.<p><p>“It’s a skill to know how to read the right signals – a student may be tired or nervous – but it’s important to see the overall picture,” says Hirvonen. “This field demands an authentic and passionate attitude, drive, and talent – without those it’s impossible to succeed,” she says.<p><p>Finnish fashion is often characterised in broad strokes as bold yet sensible, minimalist, sustainable, and environmentally- and socially-aware.<p><p>Hirvonen says that while some of those descriptions hold true, she sees an underlying theme of courage: “Finnish fashion is characterised by a daring to be original and following one’s own vision.”<p><p>“This young generation has had it very easy way compared to previous generations. Yet they have seen the dangers of consumerism and are very ecologically and politically aware and think about all of the big questions. This shows in their designs, which are not throwaway clothes but long-term creations not tied to fleeting trends,” says Hirvonen.<p><p>When asked to offer up the names of the next set of future stars, Hirvonen is characteristically mum: “I never favour any one of my students over another. They’re like sweet buns baking in an oven: there’s always exciting new talent rising.”<p><p>By Katja Pantzar, April 2016<p><p>Necessity is the mother of invention<p><p>Learning how to sell<p><p>Daring to be original<p>", "time": "2016-04-21T06:12:16+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Wherever “Ikke” goes, a flock of teenage girls trails in his wake. This teenage pop singer, who started as a choirboy, follows in the footsteps of his big idol, Justin Bieber.<p><p>“Ikke! Ikke! Can we take a picture together? Can I wear your cap?” one of the girls asks Isac Elliot like they were old friends. The 15-year-old pop star hands over his cap, puts his arm around the girl’s shoulders and poses with obvious routine but without any sign of weariness.<p><p>“Hey, can I take a pic too?” another girl asks. And a third follows suit. The flashes of pink-cased smartphones go off as the “Ellioteers” capture their idol.<p><p>Mila Kosonen, 18, from Helsinki observes the bustle from the side. “I’ve followed him from day one. I should start saving for a flat, but I just spend all my money on Ikke’s gigs,” she says with a laugh. On Friday, Kosonen will be at the Oslo Spektrum Arena to see the performance of her favourite artist. “It’s gonna be my 43rd Isac Elliot gig.”<p><p>In Norway, Isac’s smiling face is also familiar from several charity campaigns. He has won the hearts of his fans in Finland and Norway with his unpretentious attitude towards them. “Ikke’s” ordinariness is his trump card, together with his music.Photo: Heli Blåfield<p><p>The concert at the Arena is not the only reason Isac Elliot is visiting Norway again. The Finnish Embassy in Oslo is appointing Isac as the first Youth Ambassador of Finland.<p><p>“My grandmother told me to wear a dark suit to the embassy and make sure my socks are long enough so my ankles don’t show,” Isac Elliot describes the instructions he’s been given.<p><p>The title of Youth Ambassador is an official recognition of Isac’s work in promoting Finnish culture in Norway and bringing together Nordic youth with his music.<p><p>“Being appointed as Youth Ambassador is a totally great honour. Maybe I can show my diploma to my grandchildren one day.”<p><p>Isac Elliot is the first Finnish artist whose sold-out concerts in Norway attract an audience that shrieks ecstatically, waving Finnish flags. The frenzy started two years ago when Isac was doing gigs in Norway. After a small free gig he ended up on a gigantic stage in front of 100,000 viewers.<p><p>“I hadn’t done more than ten gigs before that, so I just tried not to blow it but enjoy the feeling. It was incredible to perform to such a big crowd abroad.”<p><p>Since then, there have been more and more gigs and television appearances. And more fans. The singing teenager has become the most popular Finn in Norway.<p><p>“I was told that if I sing in English, it will never work, but it has worked just fine,” Isac Elliot grins. Photo: Heli Blåfield<p><p>Isac Elliot started his musical career at the age of six when he joined the famous Cantores Minores Choir of Boys and Young Men of Helsinki Cathedral. After a couple of years, at age nine, he took to pop music, inspired by the teen idol Justin Bieber, who had just made his breakthrough. The choir gave way to private singing lessons, and Isac started to gain stage experience in musicals put on at Svenska Teatern (the Swedish Theatre) in Helsinki.<p><p>Four years ago, Isac and his father Fredrik Lundén, who is an amateur musician, made an experimental demo and sent it to record companies. Neither of them thought that anything would come of it except professional advice for the future. Father and son were both surprised when all companies showed an interest in the newcomer. The choice was easy because only one record company wanted Isac to sing in English.<p><p>When the English-language first album Wake Up World made the top of the Finnish album chart and made gold in May 2013, Isac Elliot proved to the sceptics that a Finnish pop singer can sing in English and be successful.<p><p>“I’ve always wanted to do this on my own terms, and one of them is that I want to sing in English. My native language is Swedish and it wouldn’t have been natural for me to sing in Finnish, and I didn’t want to sing in Swedish either.”<p><p>Isac Elliot is working on his third studio album. This time, he has tried his hand in song-writing. Photo: Heli Blåfield<p><p>A lot has happened in three years. Isac Elliot has published two albums, his life has been made into a film called Dream big – the movie, and American rapper Tyga sings on his new single, Lipstick. “I’m so young that I don’t always quite understand what is happening. I just do my thing without holding back. If I was an adult, I’d probably worry about risks and such.”<p><p>The next big step is to get a proper foothold on the US music market. A few weeks ago the Finnish artist performed in Los Angeles at the iHeartRadio Summit, which also featured superstars such as Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.<p><p>“The jury gave me a standing ovation! I’m not allowed to reveal what is coming next, but if everything goes according to plan, we’re talking big. It is in my nature to aim higher all the time. It feels good to achieve something even if it’s only a good grade at school,” Isac says excitedly.<p><p>Isac’s father Fredi is a trained teacher, and as his son’s manager he makes sure that the compulsory school curriculum is followed, even if it means opening the schoolbooks on flights and in backstage rooms.<p><p>“Even if great new things happen, it’s good to hold on to the normal life of a 15-year-old and not start floating in the air,” Isac says.<p><p>By Lena Nelskylä, February 2016<p><p> <p><p>The most popular Finn in Norway<p><p>From church choir to Bieber’s footsteps<p><p>Secret plans<p>", "time": "2016-02-18T16:59:35+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Runeberg’s birthday by eating the quintessential Runeberg cakes (runebergintorttu in Finnish), you might be forgiven for assuming that Runeberg was a pastry chef, and a very good one at that. In fact, the raspberry jam-topped muffin is connected with a poet who stoked the self-esteem and patriotism of the Finnish people in the days before the nation achieved independence. The baker was his wife, Fredrika Runeberg.<p><p>J.L. Runeberg’s likeness stands atop a pedestal on the Esplanade in Helsinki. Closer to the ground, a statue representing the Maiden of Finland holds a tablet with the words of the Finnish national anthem, authored by Runeberg.Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>In 1846 J.L. Runeberg wrote a poem as the prologue to The Tales of Ensign Stål, an epic poem describing the events of the Finnish War (1808–09). According to legend, it took Runeberg’s friend Fredrik Pacius 15 minutes to compose music to go with the poem. It eventually became Finland’s national anthem; Runeberg’s did indeed aim to stir Finland’s patriotic spirit, more than half a century before independence. He came to be regarded as Finland’s national poet.<p><p>Many of Runeberg’s works express the patriotic spirit of his fellow Finns. He was Finland-Swedish – the term used for Finns whose native language is Swedish, which is one of modern-day Finland’s official languages. He lived his early life in central Finland, a mainly Finnish-speaking area, so he was well acquainted with Finnish speakers, as well. Although he tried his hand as a playwright, he won lasting fame as a lyric poet whose work is often compared to that of the great European romantic poets.<p><p>In a more modern twist, the Finnish folk metal band Ensiferum quotes one of his poems in a song. If Runeberg were alive today, he might well be a socially conscious hip-hop performer or a rapper in the style of Finnish artists such as Paleface or Asa.<p><p>Fredrika Runeberg was a writer and is also said to have invented the famous Runeberg cakes.Photo: Alfred Ottelin/Porvoo Museum<p><p>Behind every great man, or at least beside every great man, there’s a great woman. Runeberg’s wife Fredrika Runeberg was a writer herself, a pioneer of Finnish historical novels. She managed the Runeberg household and their eight children in Porvoo, a picturesque seaside town 50 kilometres east (30 miles) of Helsinki.<p><p>The story goes that money was often tight in the Runeberg family, but Fredrika was a frugal manager and she knew how to deal with her husband’s sweet tooth and his grumpy moods. To make what became the Runeberg cake, she took leftover bread crumbs, added punch and topped them with fruit from the garden. The muffin-like pastry became part of the poet’s daily breakfast. And on February 5, the whole country celebrates Runeberg Day.<p><p>You are encouraged to take poetic license when experimenting with different recipes for Runeberg cakes.Photo: hugovk/Flickr<p><p>Many versions exist of the cakes that bear the Runeberg name. You can find two of our favourite recipes on Desserts for Breakfast and Vagabond Baker. Creative license – some might say poetic license – is allowed, and even encouraged: For a lighter version you can experiment with substituting Greek yogurt for cream, oatmeal for bread crumbs, and healthy spelt flour and wheat germ for wheat flour. The result is just as sweet; we believe that J.L. and Fredrika themselves would have approved of it.<p><p>By Carina Chela, February 2016, updated January 2018<p><p>Stirring the patriotic spirit<p><p>The great lady <p><p>Bake your own Runeberg cakes<p>", "time": "2016-02-05T09:38:10+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The idea is to brighten up the city streets at the darkest time of the year, with light installations transforming the parks and façades of familiar landmarks.<p><p>Visitors this year can follow a “trail of light” that includes buildings, monuments and courtyards around Kruununhaka, the neighbourhood where Senate Square and Helsinki Cathedral are located, and in the downtown core. The concept has evolved over its more than two decades of existence to embrace side events, including panel discussions on light and art, street food, and sound and light performances. Lux Helsinki installations can be viewed in 2019 from January 5 to 9.<p><p>Candy House by Sun Effects marks the beginning of the Lux Helsinki ‘trail’, adding spectacular and frivolous colour to the historic façade of the Ateneum Art Museum.

{"title": "From the virtuoso to virtuosi - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/from-the-virtuosis-to-virtuosis/", "review": "", "content": "<p>What would Jean Sibelius think if he knew his music is very appreciated all over the world by both musicians and audiences but his countrymen mostly know only his personal history?<p><p>Jean Sibelius 8 December 1865 – 20 September 1957Photo: Yousuf Karsh, Reprography: Taneli Eskola<p><p> <p><p>Jean Sibelius was born 8 December 1865 and after 150 years he still remains the figurehead of Finnish music. “If there’s one person who is the icon of the Finnish music, it is definitely Sibelius. He was the most famous Finn when alive and will most likely continue to be in the future too”, says Hannu Lintu, the Chief Conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra.<p><p>Yet Jean Sibelius is not a synonym for the Finnish music, says Sibelius Researcher Timo Virtanen from The National Library of Finland. There were composers before Sibelius, along side him and after him. Many composers of his time borrowed their approach from Mid-European, German-style musical traditions.<p><p>The Finnish sound was found at the turn of the 20th century through Sibelius. He created a style, which was at the same time national and universal. “There’s a strong recognisable Finnishness in Sibelius’s music but sometimes he felt like the Finnishness was overplayed. He wanted to be a cosmopolitan,” Virtanen reminds.<p><p>”Sibelius’s works should be approached through the music itself, not through a strong national feel”, Hannu Lintu agrees.<p><p>Even though Sibelius is the National Composer of Finland, many Finns know of the details of his life from movies and biographies of his life, rather than through his music. The Finlandia hymn is the most recognisable of his works amongst Finns. The average layman can’t tell Sibelius’s effect on Finnish music but professionals hear its echo very strongly.<p><p>”Sibelius didn’t have his own school but the symphonic structure that many Finnish composers favour, dates back to Sibelius. Of course another effect is that some composers have strived to take a totally different path, a different direction than Sibelius,” Timo Virtanen reminds.<p><p>Timo Virtanen has worked since 1997 as the Editor-in-Chief of Jean Sibelius Works at The National Library of Finland. He thinks for his birthday the composer genius would have wanted to hear that his ever-so-appreciated work was collected together as a critical edition. For now, 26 parts of the total 52 has been published. “It would be so great to give him all the published parts and give him the promise that he will get all the rest eventually.”Photo: Timo Virtanen<p><p>Sibelius’s music is often called revolutionary, especially his later works. Compositions such as his 7th Symphony and Tapiola have a modern tone that intrigues modern musicians too.<p><p> <p><p>The Chief Conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra Hannu Lintu thinks that Jean Sibelius would have wanted a gift from musicians for his 150th birthday: “I think he would have been delighted if the musicians had come to thank him for his compositions. I believe that he would have appreciated that gift the most.”Photo: Veikko Kähkönen<p><p>Sibelius was ahead of his time in many ways say both Timo Virtanen and Hannu Lintu. The most famous example of his braveness, is his Violin Concerto, op. 47 d. It had its premier in 1905, but only grew to its full glory several decades later.<p><p>“It is a difficult, original and demanding composition for the soloist, the conductor as well as for the listener. Sibelius himself called it as a cursed i. e. lovely violin concerto. He used to call himself a phenomenon from forest and that’s what the violin concerto is from the point of view of his contemporaries: dark, melancholic and strange,” Virtanen sums up.<p><p>A violin given to Jean Sibelius in 1881 by his uncle.

Photo: National Board of Antiquities / Ilari Järvinen 2015<p><p>Today this Violin Concerto is the world’s second most recorded violin concerto after Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. What makes it so popular?<p><p>Timo Virtanen believes that the extraordinary balance between the showy concerto of virtuosis and a musically emphatic composition make the concerto both exciting and original, and is easily approachable but enchanting. “It is not an easy piece to listen to, but it offers you bloomingly beautiful moments and a magnificent ending, which gives the listener a very up-lifting feel,” Virtanen describes.<p><p>Chief Conductor Lintu has conducted the Violin Concerto as well as other of Sibelius’s works countless times all over the world.<p><p>“In the best performances the soloist has had a strong ability to perceive the unity, not just to focus on the composition with one tone at a time. The Violin Concerto demands virtuosity from a soloist. There are a lot of interpretation possibilities. The technical perfection isn’t enough. One kind of needs to get inside the composition,” Lintu imparts.<p><p> <p><p>By Lena Nelskylä, December 2015<p><p> <p><p>1865–1957<p><p>– Internationally renowned and most recorded Finnish composer<p><p>– Main works:<p><p>Symphonies 1–7 (1899–1924) Kullervo op. 7 (1892) Finlandia op. 26 (1899) Karelia-series, op. 11 (1893) Violin Concerto, op. 47 d-molli (1905)<p><p>– Since 2011 Finland has had a flag day to honour Finnish Music and Jean Sibelius on his birthday, December 8.<p><p>born 1967<p><p>– The Chief Conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra<p><p>– Known for his contribution to contemporary music and premier pieces<p><p>– Conducted numerous symphony orchestras around the world<p><p>born 1965<p><p>– Doctor of Music, Docent at the Sibelius Academy, University of the Arts Helsinki<p><p>– Works as the Editor-in-Chief of Jean Sibelius Works at the National Library of Finland<p><p> <p><p>Finns know his bio better than music<p><p>‘The cursed violin concerto’<p><p>Jean Sibelius<p><p>Hannu Lintu<p><p>Timo Virtanen<p>", "time": "2015-12-08T09:29:46+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "Tom of Finland: From the fringe to the mainstream - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/from-the-fringe-to-the-mainstream/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Times have changed since the days when artist Tom of Finland (real name Touko Laaksonen, 1920–1991) needed to destroy his stylised homoerotic images because of the conservative atmosphere in his home country. Today these controversial artworks have become a symbol of tolerance.<p><p>They made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the way sexual minorities perceive themselves. Laaksonen is often considered Finland’s most famous artist internationally. His work has adorned postage stamps – the most popular stamp set in the history of the Finnish Postal Service – and now it has also become an emoji. The emoji recognises the impact and importance of Tom of Finland’s art, and appears just before same-sex marriage officially becomes legal in Finland (as of March 1, 2017).<p><p>The Tom of Finland emoji recognises the impact and importance of the artist’s work.Illustration: ThisisFINLAND; image © Tom of Finland Foundation<p><p>The Finnish Postal Service, Posti, first introduced stamps in 1856. It took them 158 years to release a stamp set that aroused worldwide interest – a lot of it. Posti’s webstore crashed in April 2014 under the weight of 70,000 pre-orders flooding in from 178 countries. This was all down to Tom of Finland.<p><p>The stamp set was by far the most public gesture of acceptance for the controversial Finnish artist Touko Laaksonen, who created his work under the pseudonym Tom of Finland. Times have changed since conservative post-war Finland, when he first illustrated men in various states of undress and coupling. Back then Laaksonen was, at times, forced to destroy his illegal imaginings, when unable to find a safe place to store them.<p><p>Tom of Finland has been the most popular stamp set ever launched by the Finnish Postal Service. Photo: Itella Posti/Finland; original images (1978, 1979) Tom of Finland Foundation/USA.<p><p>“The things he did are seen in a different light these days, more sympathetic,” says Susanna Luoto, the Finnish representative of the Tom of Finland Foundation (ToFF), which initiated the Posti stamp. “It has entered into another field than purely sexual. Tom stands for all tolerance today, beyond homosexuality.”<p><p>The current ubiquity of Tom’s moustachioed masculinity reflects this wider acceptance. His iconic images have appeared on shopping bags, bed sheets, paper products, aprons and fire blankets, thanks to the Foundation’s collaborations with Finnish companies such as Finlayson, Putinki and Jalo Helsinki.<p><p>The Finnish textile company Finlayson exclusively prints Tom’s monochrome fabric. When Tom jumped into beds as bedlinen, the Finlayson brand jumped, too. The sales of the webshop doubled and the overall sales grew significantly compared to previous years. Tom of Finland helped a company, previously operating mainly in Finland, to grow internationally: the line was taken to more than 21 countries. It has sold the most in its home country, with Sweden and the USA following.<p><p>Touko Laaksonen produced over 3,500 works during his lifetime and many now adorn shopping bags, bed sheets, paper products, aprons and fire blankets. The illustrated monochrome images on the Finlayson textile products have been a hit ever since they were launched.Photo: Finlayson <p><p>“The way you embed someone is that you endear them to the population, and you do that through things that can be found in everyday life,” explains ToFF president Durk Dehner. “It’s a really healthy way to spread the news, by allowing people to see it, explore it, find out who this man was.”<p><p>Dehner has observed Tom’s gradual acceptance from a unique vantage point: his three-story home in Los Angeles. It was there in 1984 that he co-founded the non-profit foundation with Laaksonen, as a means of preserving his work and nurturing erotic art.<p><p>Although Tom of Finland had cultivated a loyal fanbase in the US from 1956, when his images first appeared in male muscle magazine Physique Pictorial, his inaugural visit to America only came in the late 1970s. Here he found the social climate more conducive to his lifestyle and he became a frequent visitor.<p><p>When Touko Laaksonen began to visit the US regularly in the late 1970s, he came to realise the profound effect that Tom of Finland was having on the gay community. Laaksonen (right) was inspired by his muse and good friend Durk Dehner.Photo: Tom of Finland Foundation<p><p>Upon Touko Laaksonen’s eventual passing in 1991, Durk Dehner, his former muse and good friend, took up the responsibility of preserving his legacy.<p><p>“I gave him my personal commitment that I would do everything within my means to keep him in popular culture,” Dehner says. “I have been able to do that from generation to generation, because his work is timeless.”<p><p>Laaksonen produced over 3,500 works during his lifetime. Many of them are in the possession of ToFF, while others have either been acquired privately or by the permanent collections of museums such as Helsinki’s Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma, New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.<p><p>Tom of Finland (real name Touko Laaksonen, 1920–1991) is often called the most famous Finnish artist in the world. His highly stylized homoerotic images have widely influenced not only gay men, but also pop culture and fashion aesthetics.Tom of Finland, Untitled, 1966, graphite on paper, © 1966 Tom of Finland Foundation.<p><p>Those seeking his work don’t have to look far. Alongside the expanding catalogue of Tom-themed products on offer, the artist’s work has also been displayed in Germany, Spain, Canada and Norway, to name but a handful of countries.

Part of Flow’s charm is its location: close to the centre of Helsinki at the defunct Suvilahti power plant and its industrial surroundings. Along with this year’s headliners such as Pet Shop Boys, Major Lazer, Beck and Róisín Murphy, Flow is also a great opportunity to check out some Finnish tunes. Unsure of what’s what and who’s who?

The guys from Helsinki band Shiraz Lane, which I saw on Tuska’s club stage when I went, tell me that metal is just part of the Finnish culture. According to them, the general Finnish attitude is, “If it’s not metal, it’s not cool.” They also think the cold, dark winter weather might be one reason why people like to listen to metal.<p><p>Yet as the Helsinki summer sunshine beats down on my face, perhaps the biggest surprise of my adventure in Finland is the open-armed, generous personality of the Finnish people. Though my language skills are minimal to say the least, it was rather surprising that I managed to connect and bond with so many Finnish metal fans, showing that a common love for music is bigger than you’d ever imagine.<p><p>You can see it clearly at Tuska. The thousands of people who attend may appear intimidating to outsiders, and understandably so. T-shirts display graphic artwork, bands portray themes of horror and mosh pits appear to champion violence. Yet the reality is quite the opposite. It seems like every single festival participant smiles and engages you in conversation. Perhaps it’s the attitude of the Finnish people, or maybe metal forms a bond that goes beyond nationality and unites people in a common love of music.<p><p>On a Helsinki summer night, a young metal fan waits to see who or what will emerge out of the smoke onstage.Photo: Katie Needham<p><p>The Finns’ welcoming attitude also translates to a love of food. My previous experience of food stalls at British music festivals had left a sour taste in my mouth, yet Finnish cuisine goes beyond my wildest dreams. Moose, reindeer, bear and numerous other bizarre yet brilliant meats were available during my pilgrimage, adding an extra level to my experience of the Tuska Festival and Finland as a whole.<p><p>They say that New York is the city that never sleeps, but judging by my experience this applies equally to Helsinki, in its own way. The white nights phenomenon means that, even in southern Finland, the summer sky hardly gets dark at all. This erases fatigue and allows party-loving people to keep going all day and night. It adds to the warm, welcoming feeling I’ve had ever since stepping off the plane. Bars cater to all walks of life and musical preference, and idyllic pubs offer a variety of ales you’ve probably never heard of.<p><p>With gorgeous scenery everywhere I look, Finland strikes me as the hidden gem of Europe. Lakes and forests rich in wildlife are found only a stone’s throw away from a capital city bursting with culture.<p><p>At the same time, Finland also feels like the place where heavy metal and its subculture belong. It’s common for metal to remain underground in most societies, but Helsinki prides itself on the alternative. People walk the streets without bias, and the Tuska Festival only reinforces this attitude. So as I watch Finnish metal heroes Amorphis intertwine beauty and brutality, I have never felt more comfortable. I may be miles away from Manchester, but in the warm embrace of the Helsinki metal community I feel at home.<p><p>By James Weaver, July 2015, updated April 2018<p><p>Days of ecstatic agony<p><p>Open-armed and generous<p><p>Helsinki never sleeps<p>", "time": "2015-07-17T12:27:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

It originates in the music’s complexity and rich emotional content.<p><p>If you cast your mind back to 2006, Finland’s first Eurovision success occurred when the monster-masked heavy metal five-piece Lordi took the Eurovision Song Contest by storm, despite the competition’s well-deserved reputation as the epitome of cheesy, bubblegum pop music.<p><p>Finland is renowned for its heavy metal exports well beyond Eurovision: Nightwish, HIM, Insomnium, Children of Bodom, Amorphis and many other Finnish artists are cherished by metal communities around the globe. Nightwish have sold more than eight million records worldwide – a huge achievement for a band in a genre that struggles to get mainstream media coverage.<p><p>This phenomenon has existed for years but the question remains: How can Finnish metal bands inspire such popularity abroad?<p><p>Heavy metal hot spot: Finland is the reddest country on the map when it comes to metal music, with a whopping 53.2 bands per 100,000 people.Illustration: depo/cc-by-sa<p><p>By definition, heavy metal fans crave music from outside the mainstream. They champion material that boldly stands out against the normality of pop. Perhaps this is the main reason why Finnish metal is adored abroad.<p><p>Finnish metal features incredibly complicated song structures. From Children of Bodom’s intricate yet mesmerising guitar solos to Apocalyptica’s dedication to the use of cellos instead of guitars, and even Nightwish’s drive for telling tales of fantasy, Finland’s musical exports have qualities that set them apart in the heavy metal world.<p><p>David Creamer, a 19-year-old metal fanatic from Manchester, England, puts his love for Finnish metal down to the songs’ structural complexity. “When I talk about musical complexity in relation to Finland’s metal musicians, I don’t so much mean the technical aspects of their writing, although there are many Finnish metal acts like Wintersun that do push their musical talents hard,” he says. “But more than that, there is a striking diversity in the styles of metal that hail from Finland. Thinking about this complexity, Finnish bands have a seemingly endless capacity to cater for fans who like to listen to a variety of metal.”<p><p>The existence of so much variety in both the song-writing and the complexity of the musical approach makes the music enjoyable to fans all over the globe.<p><p>Now that you mention it, the members of Insomnium do look like they may be suffering from a slight lack of sleep.Photo: Axel Jusseit<p><p>While audiences appreciate complicated song structures and expert musicianship, another notable characteristic of Finnish metal bands is a burning desire to express a multitude of emotions. Insomnium’s beautiful twin guitar play and moving lyrics can move listeners to tears. Children of Bodom can channel your inner aggression, and Korpiklaani can set you roaring with laughter with their cheery fusion of metal and folk.<p><p>Nightwish have long been known to tell stories of fantasy and add emotion to their works through a theatrical musical approach, using a combination of keyboards, double bass drumming, heavy guitars and operatic vocals.<p><p>On the back of the band’s eighth studio record, acclaimed by music critics around the globe, lead vocalist Floor Jansen explains how Nightwish exemplify why Finnish metal is so popular. She emphasises the importance of the emotions it triggers and the themes it covers – including a surprising link to nature.<p><p>“This music triggers your imagination, and this album tries to trigger not just your imagination but the magic of reality,” she says. “Things like how birds migrate or how the world starts to grow again after winter. There are so many small miracles in nature. That makes this album unique.”<p><p>Finnish metal bands aren’t afraid to mix far-flung influences. Here violinist Pekka Kuusisto and Uilleann piper Troy Donockley are jamming with Nightwish.Photo: Timo Isoaho<p><p>A 2012 heat map shows that Finland is the world leader in terms of metal bands per capita, with 53.2 metal bands per 100,000 people.<p><p>Considering this level of enthusiasm, it’s no surprise that Finnish metal is extremely popular not just within the country’s borders, but to a global music audience as well. The age of the internet and social media has helped bolster Finland’s grip on the hearts and minds of metal fans, with channels like Spotify and YouTube giving worldwide access to a host of Finnish talent.<p><p>With many of Finland’s biggest metal exports performing at music festivals around the world every summer, Finland’s relentless dominance of the global heavy metal scene shows no signs of slowing down.<p><p>By James Weaver, June 2015<p><p>Musical complexity<p><p>Driving emotion through music<p><p>In a league of its own<p>", "time": "2015-07-14T08:13:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The Finns are among the biggest coffee drinkers in the world, and have been for decades. Every Finn has his or her own reasons for loving coffee.<p><p>When she starts talking about coffee, Erja Korhonen is almost unstoppable. A television scriptwriter, she admits that she can’t start her day without drinking two big mugs, prepared in a typical Finnish way with a bit of milk and no sugar. “I like the way I feel after drinking it,” says Korhonen, who also says she is quite picky about her coffee.<p><p>Finnish coffee is often made from light-roasted beans and tastes a bit acidic. Yet tastes have expanded, and nowadays Finnish producers and the country’s booming café culture cater to all preferences, offering a spectrum from light to dark.<p><p>Café culture is booming in Finland. (This table lives at Johan &amp; Nyström in Helsinki.)Photo: Joanna Nylund<p><p>According to the International Coffee Association, each Finn consumes 12 kilograms of coffee per year. This makes Finland the second-largest country in the world for per capita coffee consumption. If it was calculated differently, it might even take first place: Luxembourg currently holds the lead, not because of the coffee habits of its inhabitants, but because of cross-border trade with its neighbours.<p><p>The love story between Finns and their kahvi has lasted for more than a century. Finnish novels, paintings and essays from the early 20th century all show how important the drink had already become.<p><p>Even nowadays, Finns often like to tell anecdotes about their forebears’ relationship to coffee. Maria Oiva, another Finnish coffee lover, smiles when she talks about her grandfather. “He was a theatre director in Helsinki,” she says. “When he was working, his cup of coffee always had to be full. One day, he had some health problems. The doctor asked him how many cups of coffee he drank every day. He had no idea! So he started to count. He reached 35 cups a day. That’s huge!”<p><p>When she tells the story to her Finnish friends, Maria says they are very surprised at first. “But then they think for a while and say, ‘Well, yes, maybe that could happen to us, too.’”<p><p>Pick a cup, any cup: Tools for coffee drinking are on display at Andante, a café in Helsinki.Photo: Joanna Nylund<p><p>Lasse Vidman, an award-winning Finnish barista, says their passion for the hot beverage is hard to explain. “Part of the reason could be that we live in a cold country, so we need to drink warm, sustaining beverages,” he says.<p><p>He also suggests another, more sentimental reason: “Coffee is also linked with our best memories. For instance, when I was a child, I loved to go ice-fishing in the winter, with a thermos full of good, hot coffee in my bag. I am also sure that every Finn remembers where he or she was when he had his or her first taste of coffee.”<p><p>Coffee also forms an important part of social interaction in Finland. Korhonen has noticed it at her workplace. “Coffee breaks the ice,” she says. “During the coffee break, my colleagues and I talk about other things than work. We get to know each other. And all this thanks to coffee.

{"title": "Finnish punk music is alive and kicking - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-punk-music-is-alive-and-kicking/", "review": "", "content": "<p>While Finnish metal bands have a huge following abroad, punk rock has also produced its own fair share of international cult acts over the last several decades. Finland even sent punk band Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät (PKN) to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2015. We check out the surprisingly colourful story of Finnish punk.<p><p> Language is the most obvious thing that sets Finnish punk apart. The majority of the bands have always sung in Finnish. Rhythmically, Finnish is well suited to punk’s often aggressive style. The music is often extremely melodic, too – a little more so than in other European punk scenes. The raw immediacy in much of the punk music originating in Finland has made local groups, especially hardcore bands, popular in similar scenes as far away as South America. Finnish punk was born around 1977 and its first golden age lasted until roughly 1984. Now it’s fast approaching middle age – and experiencing a new and slightly unexpected success. <p><p>Hardcore band Terveet Kädet started in Finnish Lapland in 1980 and still tour the concert circuit.Photo: Terveet Kädet<p><p> The Sex Pistols had an impact on the early stages of punk in Finland, as they did in so many countries. The UK band was supposed to play Helsinki on January 18, 1978, but an incendiary article about them in the country’s largest newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, together with the perceived degeneracy of punk, inspired a variety of youth organisations and others to launch a protest. The band was denied work permits by the Minister of Interior himself and had to cancel the appearance. This moral panic provided punks in Finland with a common enemy and plenty of publicity, but the seeds for the movement had been planted earlier. The first punk record was released in 1977: I Really Hate Ya by Briard, a band consisting of Pete Malmi and Andy McCoy. The latter went on to find fame as the primary songwriter and guitar hero of Hanoi Rocks. Other bands that made it into the studio over the next few years included “godfather of Finnish punk” Pelle Miljoona, punk pranksters Eppu Normaali, Sehr Schnell, Sensuuri and Widows, one of a very small number of first-wave Finnish punk bands to sing in English. This period showed great stylistic variance. Se was the most musically varied from the get-go, with lyrics tending towards the romantic and the poetic. They were post-punk when punk was just starting out. DIY pioneers Ypö-Viis combine the Buzzcocks’ pop smarts with a much rougher sound. Sensuuri has a similarly deft melodic touch. <p><p>Teemu Bergman leads the group Pää Kii and is involved in numerous other punk projects.Photo: Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva<p><p> The greatest band of the first wave was probably Ratsia, which started out clearly influenced by London punkers, but became increasingly epic as the 1970s edged into the ’80s. In the end they sounded like a punk band cruising down some mythical Thunder Road in a Springsteen dream. The early punk scene was incredibly rich and vibrant, with a punk band or two in almost every rural town. The next time Finland saw anything like this was in the 2000s with rap, which also became a primarily Finnish-language genre. By 1980 punk was turning towards hardcore – an altogether more aggressive and less melodic beast. Finnish hardcore bands were heavy and extreme, and many of them are still popular all over the world today. Terveet Kädet from Tornio, Lapland is still active and has influenced countless bands, from Brazil’s Sepultura on down. Rattus managed to carve out a totally unique, slightly metallic sonic signature and is also still recording and playing. Kohu-63 had a promising international career cut short when one of the members ended up in jail. Kaaos is one of the most legendary bands of the early ’80s hardcore scene. Svart Records, based in the southwestern Finnish city of Turku, can make money rereleasing the genre’s classics on vinyl over 30 years later and selling them to an international audience. <p><p>Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät (PKN), a punk band whose members all have learning disabilities or other disabilities, won the honour of representing Finland at the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest.Photo: Susanna Alatalo<p><p> The accepted truth about post-1985 punk rock is that it’s a little off. Especially the 1990s are generally considered a dire period. This view is ripe for reappraisal. The new rise of Finnish punk, which started around 2005, encompasses many styles. Hook-ridden songwriting comes courtesy of numerous projects helmed by compulsive songwriter Teemu Bergman (including Pää Kii, Heartburns and Kytänsoittajat), as well as Lähtevät Kaukojunat and The Splits. The latter group records on US label Dirtnap Records. Hardcore is still going strong, too, with bands like Perikato and Maailmanloppu. Finland’s 2015 Eurovision representatives, PKN, have been spreading the word for years. There are also underground heroes such as Seksihullut, Kivesveto Go Go, Nyrkkitappelu, The Achtungs, Maakuntaradio, Valehtelijat and countless others. Finnish punk is still in rude health, and looks set to stay that way for a long time. <p><p>By Arttu Tolonen, April 2015<p><p>Protest and moral panic<p><p>A punk band in every Finnish town<p><p>Eurovision and beyond<p>", "time": "2015-05-20T06:44:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "An artist’s mark on the story of Finland - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/an-artists-mark-on-the-story-of-finland/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Photo: Turku Art Museum/Topfoto/Lehtikuva<p><p>As Finland celebrates the 150th anniversary of Akseli Gallen-Kallela’s birth, we take a closer look at a great artist whose influence on Finnish society spans everything from pre-independence political paintings to modern-day tattoos.<p><p>One of the most renowned pieces of art to emerge from Finland is The Defence of the Sampo, by Akseli Gallen-Kallela (April 26, 1865–March 7, 1931). This vivid depiction of a pivotal scene from the Finnish national epic Kalevala is even more striking when you see it up close. Some people take this notion quite literally: One Finnish man has a replica of the painting tattooed across his back, a type of canvas that was considerably underutilised during Gallen-Kallela’s lifetime. “People now feel his art is so important that they want to put it on their skin forever,” says Tuija Wahlroos, director of the Gallen-Kallela Museum. “There is always a reason why they chose his work and what it means to them.”<p><p>Not as stern as he looked: Gallen-Kallela shows off his hipster moustache in this 1890 studio portrait.Photo: Daniel Nyblin/Gallen-Kallela Museum<p><p>Such motives and motifs are revealed on July 4, 2015 at the museum, located in the artist’s former home just outside of Helsinki. In an event that seeks to expand people’s picture of the artist, photographs of people showing off tattoos inspired by Gallen-Kallela’s work will be accompanied by commentary. “His images are so well adapted to tattoos,” Wahlroos says. “They are very clear-lined and strong in many ways. This shows interestingly how Gallen-Kallela’s art transfers. I told this to a colleague who lives in the UK and he was so jealous that we have this kind of thing here.” Gallen-Kallela was greatly inspired by the Kalevala. He planned a richly illustrated version nicknamed the Great Kalevala, and completed illustrations for five of the 50 Kalevala “runes” before his death. The ceiling frescoes in the entry hall of the National Museum in Helsinki form another example of his passion for the national epic. Nonetheless, the Kalevala was just one of many interests for an artist whose legacy remains hugely influential in the Finnish art world. Gallen-Kallela was adept in artistic fields, including architecture, and championed graphic design in Finland. He also created the first example of modern Finnish design at the Paris World Fair in 1900 with Liekki (Flame), a rug artwork woven using the traditional ryijy technique.<p><p>In this 1902 photo, Akseli Gallen-Kallela (left) and assistants are painting the fresco “Spring” in the Jusélius Mausoleum in the west-coast town of Pori.Photo: Gallen-Kallela Museum<p><p>Photographs suggest that the artist was a stern gentleman, surrounded by privilege – a misperception that Wahlroos is keen to dispel. “The picture of Gallen-Kallela has become too stuffy,” she explains. “In his time he was hardworking and lived a not-so-luxurious life that was rich in many other ways. He was normal father and had the same kinds of problems as everyone else.” History has also painted Gallen-Kallela as a frequent socialiser. Parties with the likes of famed composer Jean Sibelius (also born in 1865) have become folklore. While the artist certainly enjoyed socialising on occasion, such gatherings took place in the midst of great artistic productivity. “He had a very high work ethic,” Wahlroos says. “If you think about his vast life’s work, thousands of paintings and other artworks, it is obvious he couldn’t have done all this if he was frequenting bars or restaurants all the time. On the contrary, he enjoyed family life.”<p><p>The artist built a studio and house, complete with a castle-like tower, by the sea at Tarvaspää, just outside Helsinki. It is now the Gallen-Kallela Museum.Photo: Helinä Kuusela/Lehtikuva<p><p>Testament to his diverse interests, many of these artworks and personal items are on display at the Gallen-Kallela museum. His 1906 painting The Royal Ship of Free Finland, on loan from the Reitz Foundation, depicts the most pressing cultural issue of the era: Finnish independence. Like many of his contemporaries, Gallen-Kallela commented on the brewing discontent with Russian rule through his work. His societal impact became even more prominent after independence was achieved in 1917; he was named as General C.G.E. Mannerheim’s adjutant in 1919. Over the course of a year he created numerous symbols of independence, including a proposed design (eventually rejected) for the Finnish flag. Perhaps his most notable work was designing the medals that make up the Order of the White Rose of Finland, a system still in use today for honouring military and civilian merit. The artist’s spirit lives on, both in Finland and abroad. “Gallen-Kallela had a wide international network,” Wahlroos says. “In our archive we have the letters he received, from more than 2,000 people all over the world.”<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, April 2015<p><p>Kalevala and beyond<p><p>Work ethic and family life<p><p>Independent spirit<p>", "time": "2015-05-08T10:44:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Actually, she wrote it simultaneously in English and Finnish, switching between versions. The US version appeared with a first print run of 50,000 – an impressive vote of confidence in a country known to have a narrow market for translated literature. Memory of Water has made the shortlist for prestigious sci-fi prizes named after influential writers on both sides of the Atlantic: the Arthur C. Clarke Award in the UK and the Philip K. Dick Award in the US.<p><p>It’s not entirely correct to call “Memory of Water” translated literature; Itäranta wrote it in both English and Finnish.Photo: Heini Lehväslaiho/Teos<p><p>The novel presents a world that is simultaneously futuristic and primitive. The author transports us to a very changed version of our earth that is still within the realm of reality, or even probability. Itäranta’s future world lets her comment on our current events, including environmental threats and trampled human rights.<p><p>In the book, the Finnish coastline has changed, leaving much of today’s Finland under water. Drinkable water is scarce and heavily rationed by a brutally repressive military dictatorship.<p><p>In a moving passage early on, Itäranta’s teenage main character Noria envisions the past – our present. She gazes over a former landfill site – a “plastic grave” – and tries to understand how people in our time thought and felt, just as Itäranta, in creating Noria’s story, tries to picture the conditions and feelings of the future:<p><p>“Their past-world bleeds into our present-world,” Noria narrates. “Did the present-world, the world that is, ever bleed into theirs, the world that was? I imagine one of them standing by the river that is now a dry scar in our landscape….Something that has not yet been is bleeding into her thoughts.”<p><p>Noria wonders if the people of the past cared at all about the effect of their actions on the world. Did they try to change their behaviour and make a difference, or were they indifferent?<p><p>The coverline on one version of “Memory of Water” reads “Knowledge is power;” on another version it says “Some secrets demand betrayal.”Photo: eppujensen/flickr cc by-nc-sa; cover: HarperCollins<p><p>It’s not entirely correct to call Memory of Water translated literature. Itäranta, who was born and raised in Tampere, Finland and has lived in England since 2007, wrote the Finnish and English versions in parallel. “I started writing this book while doing a creative writing degree at the University of Kent, so obviously I had to do it in English,” she says.<p><p>“Once I had written one or two chapters, I realised that it would be really useful to get some feedback from my Finnish writing group. We meet once a month online. So I wrote those early chapters in Finnish, too. As I was doing that, I began to realise that working in both languages actually helped me polish the writing, because I had to look at it so closely.”<p><p>Soon she developed a routine. “Most of the time I ended up writing the first draft of each chapter in Finnish, then I would translate it into English and edit it, making some changes as I translated, then update the Finnish version of the chapter.”<p><p>Two things set her method apart from a conventional translation: It goes in both directions between the two languages, and the author herself writes both versions. “Each chapter actually took shape through those two languages,” Itäranta says.<p><p>The cover of the Finnish hardcover edition looks very different. There is also a separate title in Finnish: “Teemestarin kirja” (The Tea Master’s Book).Cover design: Ville Tiihonen/Teos<p><p>The teenager Noria is a tea master’s daughter, and will soon take the test to become a tea master herself. The tea ceremony tradition, transplanted to Finnish territory generations before the story begins, forms a powerful symbol in a world where water is limited.<p><p>The title Memory of Water invites interpretation: the society in the book has only a collective memory – if that – of plentiful, clean water as Finland knows it today, but the water in the story can also be said to carry and reveal its own memories and reminders.<p><p>Water also offers a vehicle for commenting on dictatorial politics and environmental inaction. The novel’s description of military dictatorship seems to pass judgement on the conveyor belt of dictators that we see in the news today. “It was intentional,” says Itäranta. “I thought, What would the political consequences be if drinking water was such a valuable, scarce resource? Dictatorships control resources as a tool of power to control people.”<p><p>“I think that as a species we have a built-in capacity for self-destructive behaviour, but also a built-in capacity to improve things, to make a change,” she says.<p><p>All this is framed by the events of Noria’s life. “The story is really about coming of age and learning to make your own choices rather than taking for granted what your parents have told you or what society tells you,” the author says.<p><p>“Sometimes you have to make a choice that may not help you, but you know it’s the right thing to do.”<p><p>By Peter Marten, May 2015<p><p>A primitive future<p><p>Parallel visions<p><p>Making your own choices<p>", "time": "2015-05-08T08:03:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

One arena that has resisted its irreverent charms is the Eurovision Song Contest. Every other genre under the sun, from Balkan rap to Eurodance opera, has had its day, but the event’s fundamentally kitschy nature and wholehearted embrace of cargo-cult-like conceptions of glamour has served as an effective bulwark against punk rock, a genre that sets great store in streetwise ideas of authenticity. Until 2015, punk and Eurovision had never crossed paths, but that all changed when Finland chose its representative on February 28, 2015. Every country holds a national selection process ahead of the main Eurovision event. <p><p>Eurovision emissaries: PKN includes Pertti Kurikka (guitar, left), Sami Helle (bass), Kari Aalto (vocals) and Toni Välitalo (drums).Photo: Sony Music<p><p> Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät (PKN) is the first punk band at Eurovision. Its members are the first Eurovision performers with learning disabilities. Their song “Aina mun pitää” (roughly “I Always Gotta”) is also, at one minute and 25 seconds, the shortest Eurovision entry ever. At this point, the middle-aged foursome is used to international attention. The Punk Syndrome, a documentary about the band, became an international cult hit a couple years ago, and they’ve already toured continental Europe and the UK. However, the amount of attention that Eurovision has brought the band is something else. When we talk to them at the very end of a long day of interviews, singer Kari Aalto, who is usually very talkative, is obviously tired. He steps out for a smoke as we start the conversation. This time it’s up to bass player Sami Helle to do most of the talking. Promotional duties have kept the guys from familiarising themselves with their competition in Vienna. “I haven’t had time to do anything,” Helle says. “If there’s time, I’d like to check out some of the other acts and see who our toughest competition is, because we are so different – in a good way. I think England, Holland and probably Spain will be difficult to beat. They’re all good at football, too.” I ask the guys about their personal Eurovision memories. “I’ve looked at this whole thing and come to the conclusion that it’s too commercial now,” says Helle. “It used to be about the music, but these days there’s just too much stuff on stage.” <p><p>Compared to the rest of the Eurovision acts, PKN’s music is “different – in a good way,” says bassist Sami Helle (back right).Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p> The others agree that the emphasis has, over the years, shifted away from music. Helle and guitarist Pertti Kurikka share a favourite Eurovision song of all time: “Pump Pump” by Fredi, Finland’s entry in 1976. “One of the greatest things about being at the concerts for the contest was the opportunity to meet one of my idols, Fredi,” Helle says. “Yeah, Fredi is great,” Kurikka chimes in. “I had that record as a child, the one with ‘Pump Pump’ on it. I met him, too. He was back there.” When asked about his favourite from years gone by, drummer Toni Välitalo names PKN’s own tune, “Aina mun pitää.” “But that’s not from years gone by, Toni!” Helle yells. “Don’t you have any older favourites?” Välitalo professes a liking for Hard Rock Hallelujah by Lordi, the Finnish monster-metal act that won Eurovision in 2006. For Välitalo, at least, that formed part of the inspiration to enter the contest. Kalle Pajamaa and Teuvo Merkkiniemi, who have both worked with band for quite a while, first floated the idea. “And then, since this guy’s a bit of a Eurovision nut,” Helle says, pointing at Kurikka, “we got sucked into the whole thing, even though I was a little put off at first. But as long as we can go in music-first and let the song get our message across, I’m happy.” <p><p>Pertti Kurikka, who plays guitar and has also lent his name to the band, appears unfazed by his celebrity status.Photo: Susanna Alatalo<p><p> So no dancers or explosions for PKN? “Oh, in your dreams!” Sami exclaims. “No way! We had a smoke machine at UMK [the Finnish Eurovision qualification contest], though, and I hope we can get two or three for Eurovision. I want lots of smoke! Then people won’t see us at all!” I ask Välitalo if he enjoyed the Eurovision selection process. “We played well,” he says. “And then we won. Winning felt really good.” Helle says he hasn’t quite wrapped his head around the reality of their situation. “It’s so hard to comprehend that I’m going to a contest that has run for 60 years, to represent my own country,” he says. “It’s an anniversary year and we’re representing Finland. And Finland is competing for the 49th time. So if we win, some other Finnish band gets to be the 50th Finnish representative, at the [2016] finals held in Helsinki!” (Eurovision is always held in the country that won the previous year’s contest.) People have asked the band if they’re going to “pull a Lordi,” referring to the Finnish band that won the whole thing in 2006. “No!” is the answer. “We’re going to do a PKN!” This is a band that does things on its own terms. The interview winds up. Kari Aalto, the singer, has stepped back in for a photo opportunity, but he’s weary. He says that he’s partial to Hard Rock Hallelujah. And that he wants to go drinking in Kallio – a Helsinki neighbourhood with a rough-and-tumble reputation that suits a punk rocker. <p><p>By Arttu Tolonen, May 2015<p><p>Big-time spotlight<p><p>Pumping it up<p><p>Smoke machines allowed<p>", "time": "2015-05-06T20:46:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Finnish film director enters the big time - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-film-director-enters-the-big-time/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Director Jalmari Helander’s new film, Big Game, drops a Hollywood superstar into the middle of the Finnish forest.<p><p>How many people have an uncle who offers them the opportunity to act in a film alongside a Hollywood legend? Well, that small group now includes at least one Finn: 14-year-old Onni Tommila, whose mother’s brother, director Jalmari Helander, cast him for a prime role in Big Game (releases March 19, 2015 in Finland, May 8 in the UK and June 26 in the US).<p><p>Armed with a bow and arrows, Tommila’s character, Oskari, finds himself tasked with a rescue mission after Air Force One is attacked in the skies over Finland and the US President, played by Samuel L. Jackson, escapes to the forest below. Bad guys, double crosses, action scenes and catchphrases abound as the unlikely duo hightail it to safety.<p><p><p><p>Watch the trailer for “Big Game.”<p><p>Helander’s previous film, the award-winning Rare Exports, featured a raw, irreverent take on the institution of Santa Claus. Big Game’s warm sense of humour and adventuresome proceedings have attracted glowing reviews. Critics have praised Tommila’s performance, and the Guardian described the film as “a sparky romp that recalls the children’s action movies of the 1980s.”<p><p>Helander couldn’t agree more. “It’s like my childhood dream in a way, what happens in the movie and the kind of adventure that follows,” he says with a smile, before pointing out another significant influence from the same era: “I spent a lot of time in the forest shooting arrows after seeing the Rambo movies.”<p><p>Helander’s evergreen enthusiasm for creating cinematic moments continued to grow over the years, leaving no room for alternative career options. He had to become a filmmaker, no matter what. “I never actually had a Plan B,” he says. “I always had this one thing on my mind. Everything I have done is to achieve this.”<p><p>Oskari (Onni Tommila) comes to the rescue of the American commander-in-chief.Photo: Stephanie Kulbach<p><p>In person, Helander exhibits a quiet confidence. Maintaining constant eye contact as he talks, his manner is steady and focussed – much in the same way he has cultivated his passion for cinema into a successful career. His debut feature-length movie, Rare Exports, formed a significant milestone and was more than an overnight success.<p><p>Arriving on screens just in time for Christmas 2010, the horror-fantasy-thriller evolved from a duo of short films based around the same concept. Famed American critic Roger Ebert praised Helander’s alternative Santa Claus myth, proclaiming it as “a rather brilliant lump of coal for your stocking hung by the fireside with care.” Many others agreed.<p><p>The snowballing success of Rare Exports led to greater international exposure and let Helander achieve something rare in Finnish cinema: It attracted the interest of A-list Hollywood actors.<p><p>Meanwhile, back home in America, the officials played by Victor Garber, Felicity Huffman, Jim Broadbent and Ted Levine are dumbfounded by the disappearance of the President.Photo: Stephanie Kulbach<p><p>The 8.5-million-euro budget of Big Game is the largest in Finnish film history. In another victory for superlatives, it has also secured the widest distribution deal ever for a Finnish film in the US.<p><p>“It’s been a long road to get here, to be able to do Big Game, which is a totally different Finnish film than anyone has ever done,” Helander says. “There were a lot of people along the way saying that it isn’t possible, but here I am.”<p><p>So, having been given a seal of approval from Tinseltown, does the film represent a new era for Finnish cinema? “I hope so,” Helander says. “I think it’s really good for people to see that it’s also possible to do something that is not the usual way of doing things. It might open doors for other filmmakers from Finland to be able to create something different.”<p><p>When conversation switches to his own future plans, Helander’s eyes light up. He alludes to plans for writing “a bigger adventure,” but declines to elaborate further. Whatever adventure ends up on the silver screen next, Helander will have no shortage of cinematic inspiration to draw from in the meantime.<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, March 2015<p><p>Adventure and humour<p><p>Rare qualities<p><p>Opening doors for Finnish film<p>", "time": "2015-04-17T07:58:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Three iconic Finns remain relevant at 150 - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/three-iconic-finns-remain-relevant-at-150/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Photo: Halosenniemi/Tuusula Museum<p><p>Artists Pekka Halonen and Akseli Gallen-Kallela and composer Jean Sibelius, all born in 1865, helped form the Finnish national identity. When Gallen-Kallela and Halonen recently reappeared on Facebook and started posting their thoughts, modern readers began to interact with the painters as if they were still alive.<p><p>For Finland, 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of the births of two famous artists (Akseli Gallen-Kallela and Pekka Halonen) and the country’s most famous composer (Jean Sibelius). All three had houses near Helsinki and belonged the same circle of friends during a critical time in the formation of the Finnish national identity, helping set the scene for Finland’s eventual independence, achieved in 1917. The legacies of this trio of cultural figures still resonate profoundly in Finland today. The three friends fuelled one another’s creativity as they expanded the frontier of Finland’s rapidly evolving artistic scene. Both Sibelius and Halonen joined many of their creative peers residing near Lake Tuusula, about 30 kilometres north of Helsinki. Surrounded by nature, they took their inspiration in the colours of their environment. Halonen would become renowned for his beautiful winter landscapes, and Sibelius transformed the visual splendour into majestic soundscapes. His compositions also formed a source of inspiration for Gallen-Kallela’s paintings.<p><p>Pekka Halonen, shown here in a self-portrait, has “reappeared” and is posting on Facebook, as is his colleague Akseli Gallen-Kallela. (Click on picture to see uncropped version.)Photo: Halosenniemi<p><p>The trio’s shared inspiration extended to their wider social network. Here they explored integral themes and issues that played a significant role in the formation of the national identity, as Finland’s independence beckoned in the early 20th century. “Outside of art they were culturally influential people,” says Satu Rantala from the Gallen-Kallela Museum, located just outside Helsinki. “They were right there in the middle of society.” The social network they maintained in those days has now inspired an innovative way to celebrate the two visual artists in particular. Profiles for Gallen-Kallela and Halonen have been created on Facebook, utilising the modern era’s fascination with social media. Visitors to the pages are transported back to 1915. As the calendar year unfurls, fresh posts mark historical events in the artists’ lives during that year and seek to illustrate the richness of each man’s character. “We’ve used archival material such as their receipts and remnants of their personal lives, like menus,” says Rantala, who is responsible for the project. “We have letters and photographs, and we know what exhibitions they had during that year. We also really like to connect their lives to what happened in society at that time.”<p><p>Akseli Gallen-Kallela painted this self-portrait for the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy in 1916. (Click on picture to see uncropped version.)Photo: Douglas Sivén/Gallen-Kallela Museum<p><p>As the year progresses, aside from accumulating a growing number of “likes,” the project is generating an interesting response from visitors: many are interacting with the artists as if they were still alive. “People want to make a connection,” Rantala says. “They have come out with various information that they have, such as a nice story, or they may have known someone from [the artist’s] family.” One man posted greetings directly to Halonen, who turns out to have been his great-grandfather. Another reader mentioned that she had had the pleasure of meeting Halonen’s daughter in the 1960s. Other comments are directed specifically at the content of the posts. One woman wished Gallen-Kallela success with his “forthcoming” exhibition at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Others commented when there was a flood at his residence. Interestingly, Gallen-Kallela’s page has also been able to dispel the myth that he was less enthused about his contemporary female artists, providing archival proof to the contrary. The project also charts many of the artists’ international travels, offering insight into historical context connected to numerous other countries in addition to Finland. Given the artists’ global profile, interest is also expected from Facebook visitors abroad. To meet this audience, many postings made by the two artists are also translated in English, sometimes directly following the Finnish text in the same post. The Facebook pages demystify the two artists, reinvigorating their legacies for today’s audience.<p><p>“People suddenly feel very familiar with Gallen-Kallela,” says Tuija Wahlroos, director of the Gallen-Kallela Museum. “It seems that people have not forgotten him. They’ve been waiting for the right way to approach him.”<p><p>3 x 150 reasons to celebrate<p><p>Perhaps the best way to truly get to know these three pioneering Finns and celebrate their contributions is to visit their former homes, which now stand as museums, just outside Helsinki.

The exception came in 2006, when Finnish monster-metal band Lordi – the first hard-rockers to enter the contest – won by the biggest vote margin ever. This year’s Finnish entry, ranked number two out of 40 entries by the betting agencies at the time of writing, is set to shatter even more boundaries. “Aina mun pitää” (roughly “I Always Gotta”), by the four-man group Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät (Pertti Kurikka’s Name Day or, more conveniently, PKN), won the Finnish qualifying contest, earning the right to represent the country in Vienna in late May.<p><p><p><p>Watch the trailer for the Punk Syndrome, a documentary about PKN’s adventures.<p><p>Not only is PKN the first punk band to compete – and not only do they have the shortest entry ever – they also all have learning disabilities or other disabilities, including autism. The band got its start at a special-needs training centre in Helsinki in 2009. Since then, PKN has toured Europe and the US and gained a worldwide reputation through the explosive, warts-and-all 2012 documentary film The Punk Syndrome, which won a shelf-full of awards. The film shows the men using punk to express their frustrations with societal systems. Vocalist Kari Aalto roars out lyrics like “I don’t wanna live in an institution/I need respect and dignity in life” and “I hate Parliament/I hate this world.” Guitarist Pertti Kurikka sometimes has difficulty speaking, but he blazes on the guitar and creates blunt, sometimes disturbing lyrics, poems and illustrations. Some of these have been published internationally and featured on websites such as rock and pop culture site The Quietus. The members insist they won’t change their style for Eurovision. So it will be rather surreal to see four scruffy middle-aged men in leather jackets blasting out ’70s-style punk amid the disco-ball glitter of ESC.<p><p>PKN sounds like a jackhammer compared to the fluffy world of Eurovision.Photo: Sony Music<p><p>News that a group from so far outside the pop mainstream will be jackhammering into the fluffy world of ESC has piqued media interest. Well before PKN clinched the Finnish championship, US punk pioneers Dead Kennedys recommended a story on the group to their 1.5 million Facebook friends. The article, on the website Death and Taxes, praised PKN, though it incorrectly described them as “a band whose members all have Down Syndrome.” Readers’ comments hailed them as embodying the true original anyone-can-do-it, anti-authoritarian spirit of punk. 3News New Zealand called them “the first pure punk act to compete at the Eurovision Song Contest” while the Toronto Star said “I think we can all agree to root for Finland.” “They really do rock,” the popular US site Buzzfeed chimed in. A Fox News station in Birmingham, Alabama, enthused about PKN’s “frenetic song, only one minute 25 seconds in length”. According to the Romanian newspaper Adevărul, “this unique choice could change forever the way people with disabilities are seen in showbiz.”<p><p>Even the Finnish Parliament seems to hear the reverberations of PKN’s win in the Finnish Eurovision qualifying contest.Photo: Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva<p><p>Meanwhile, Britain’s Independent misleadingly dominated its story with the theme that PKN aimed at Eurovision “in a bid to raise awareness.” In a BBC interview, bassist Sami Helle downplayed that angle. “It’s not our first objective to change attitudes,” he said. “Our first objective is to go over there and have a good show and have the music first. Because music is the big thing for us.” However Helle, who says he wants to go into politics, recently visited Parliament to talk with MPs about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – on the day it was provisionally approved by the legislature, after a seven-year delay. “I’ve never felt equal in this country, and this is an important day for me,” he said. “We’ve waited for this day.”<p><p>By Wif Stenger, March 2015<p><p>Expressing frustration with society<p><p>Media picks up on PKN’s true punk spirit<p><p>All the way to Parliament<p>", "time": "2015-05-19T08:45:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Alternative Kalevala in the making - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/alternative-kalevala-in-the-making/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The Finnish national epic Kalevala, compiled by Elias Lönnrot in the 19th century and celebrated on Kalevala Day (February 28), contains decidedly Christian aspects. What if someone wrote another version, drawing on bear cults and shamanism found in Finnish folklore?<p><p>Lönnrot only used a purposefully selected fraction of the material in folk poetry archives. Other folklorists could use such material to compile quite different stories that might reflect ancient beliefs more accurately.<p><p>Juha Pentikäinen, professor of northern ethnography at the University of Lapland and Institute of Northern Culture in Tornio, northern Finland, aims to compile an alternative Kalevala in the form of a shamanic epic based on an ancient bear cult.<p><p>“The Kalevala as we know it today is really Elias Lönnrot’s epic, and it reflects his world view as a devout Christian keen to depict the Finns as a civilised people with monotheistic beliefs, as part of the contemporary nation building process,” says Pentikäinen. Lönnrot himself admitted that he could have used the same sources to compile seven different but equally valid Kalevala versions.<p><p>Pentikäinen recognises the artistic and historical value of Lönnrot’s Kalevala. But he feels that the revered writer took liberties by adding material of his own, reshaping ancient stories, and giving his epic a linear structure similar to the Bible, when in reality the world view of the ancient Finnish and Karelian rune-singers was cyclical and based on shamanic beliefs. “For this reason I feel there’s a need for a new, different epic closer to the world view of the original singers, with no artificial religious or nationalistic elements,” he says.<p><p>The 1894 monument to Tsar Alexander II on Helsinki’s Senate Square includes a woman often interpreted as Finland personified (left). Look closely and you’ll see she’s wearing a bearskin hood. Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>Pentikäinen is already planning to compile his “alternative Kalevala” using original narratives neglected by Lönnrot, especially poems reflecting bear cults once widespread among northern peoples before the Christian era. “There is plenty of runic material in the archives to create a bear epic that will be truer to tradition than the Kalevala,” he explains.<p><p>His story will encompass the celestial creation of the bear, its manifestation in the northern sky as the bear constellations, the sacred animal’s natural birth and annual cycle on earth, the ritual death and burial of a bear killed by hunters, and a mythical wedding before the bear returns to the skies.<p><p>He envisages his epic as being shorter and hopefully more exciting and more accessible than the version of the Kalevala that schoolchildren across Finland must read today. However, he has resolved to remain faithful to original poetic wordings and use the same trochaic meter that gives the Kalevala its characteristic rhythm.<p><p>Finnish contains many words denoting bears, terms the superstitious formerly utilised to avoid calling the animal by its name. Photo: Visit Finland<p><p>Pentikäinen has travelled widely in Russian Karelia, Lapland and Siberia, visiting ethnic groups related to the Finns, and meeting shamans and singers who have preserved ancient traditions. “The best way to learn about the deep roots of Finnish folk culture is to sit around the fires of shamans in Siberia and listen as they sing the mythological epics of their peoples,” he says.<p><p>The role of the bear in arctic mythologies represents a long-time interest for Pentikäinen. His intriguing book Golden King of the Forest (Etnika, 2007) spotlights the bear’s unique place in northern folklore and imagery. Bear cults are reflected in superstitions that persist to this day in Finland, and in the many place names that include words denoting bears, such as kontio, otso, otava, ohto, kouvo or the modern Finnish word for “bear,” formerly taboo: karhu.<p><p>Although Pentikäinen has faced considerable opposition among scholars reluctant to see Finnish folk poetry interpreted in the context of shamanism, more open-minded readers will eagerly await the publication of his alternative Kalevala as a new window into ancient Finnish and Karelian beliefs.<p><p> <p><p>By Fran Weaver, February 2012, updated 2015<p><p>Bear epic<p><p>Shamanic fires stoke imagination<p>", "time": "2015-02-24T07:04:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Known for its attention to quality and timelessness, Samuji seeks to counterbalance the prevalence of cheap, throwaway fashion.<p><p>The name “Samuji” comes from designer Samu-Jussi Koski’s own name, and though people often mistake it for a Japanese word, his clothes and accessories are very Finnish. It’s not a surprising mistake, given that the aesthetics of Finnish and Japanese design overlap. The clothes are simple, elegant and well constructed. Nonetheless, Samuji is distinctly Nordic.<p><p>Koski claims Finnish designer Alvar Aalto as the inspiration in his use of natural materials and simple shapes drawn from nature. His palette is the Finnish landscape with forest greens, deep blue lakes, yellow fields and pink sunsets; the colours are organic and soothing. The collections emphasise quality and timeless design.<p><p>When Koski first came up with the idea for Samuji, he wanted to create a perfect and complete wardrobe for women – a wardrobe that contained only ten pieces. These ten pieces formed the starting point for the Samuji Classic Collection in 2011. He later added the Seasonal Collection, which reflected a more bohemian spirit.<p><p>Every piece of clothing has a story.Photo: Karen MacKenna<p><p>Koski also wanted each piece to tell a story, and beautiful clothing does tell a story. A beloved dress has a history, while a new dress is full of promise. Samuji designs include an element of whimsy and mystery, and this, along with their everyday usefulness, has made it such an appealing brand in Finland and abroad.<p><p>I pay a visit to the Samuji studio on Korkeavuorenkatu next to Café Succès, which serves some of the best cinnamon buns in town. The studio is located upstairs in a former public sauna and still has the feel of a bathhouse. A stylish lounge area fits into the cool, open space. No need to renovate – the tile-covered floors and water faucets hidden behind the clothing racks give this unique atelier an inimitable Finnish authenticity.<p><p>The Samuji team is young and happy, and their inspiration is evident in the array of drawings, fabric swatches and found art that surround them where they work. I get a look at current and upcoming collections, from beautiful woollen coats to lightweight summer shifts. The Classic signature pieces are designed to be those essential items in a wardrobe. The boho designs are playful, yet unlikely to go out of fashion anytime soon. Before I leave I spy a pair of flat sandals and a dress that I wouldn’t mind taking home but they belong to next season. I will have to wait.<p><p>Samuji’s clothing is ethically produced in Europe, so they can “know their producers.”Photo: Karen MacKenna<p><p>Prior to launching Samuji, Koski served as creative director for the famous Finnish textile brand Marimekko. Samuji textiles now come from the UK, Italy and Japan, although the spring 2015 collection includes some of their own textiles.<p><p>Sustainable design forms a priority for Samuji. The clothing is ethically produced in Europe so they can “know their producers,” Koski says, and it’s made from natural fibres such as wool, cotton, silk and linen.<p><p>When asked who the Samuji woman is, Koski says he hopes she is someone who appreciates quality over quantity. At a time when mass-produced clothing is littering the planet, this comes as a welcome alternative. Perhaps we do only need ten timeless pieces instead of cheap, throwaway fashion that only lasts one season.<p><p>Not a lot of items: Samuji’s stores stay true to the label’s minimalistic philosophy.Photo: Karen MacKenna<p><p>Helsinki contains two Samuji storefronts: Samuji Espa and Samuji Erottaja. What you will notice when you visit them is that there are not a lot of items in the store. Nor should there be, if Samuji stays true to its philosophy of minimalism and a pared-down but solid wardrobe.<p><p>The women’s collection is presented along with the men’s line, which has been hitting the right notes since its start in the autumn of 2013. There are accessories too: hats, scarves and shoes – everything you need to feel well dressed, stylish and original.<p><p>“We aim to create everything from the heart at Samuji,” says Koski. “Hopefully that is something that translates into the Samuji designs.”<p><p> <p><p>By Karen MacKenna, February 2015<p><p>Telling a story with beautiful clothing<p><p>Know where you’re coming from<p><p>From the heart<p>", "time": "2015-02-20T09:27:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Skilfully balancing both European and US sensibilities, he has been named one of the Top 10 Directors to Watch by US industry bible Variety.<p><p>It’s September 2014 and Dome Karukoski is attending the premiere of his sixth feature-length film, The Grump, at the Toronto Film Festival. Surrounded by film fans and industry types, he regularly looks over his shoulder to gauge their reaction. Soon he doesn’t need to, with their regular bursts of laughter reflecting yet another positive response to the Finnish director’s work.<p><p>Based on the acclaimed series by Finnish author Tuomas Kyrö, The Grump offers a touching look at the generational divide. Here, an 80-year-old countrysider brings his peculiar opinions in tow when circumstances force him to move to the city under the care of his daughter-in-law.<p><p>“I read the books and thought they were very intelligent and perceptive,” Karukoski says. “At the same time they were very funny.”<p><p>Similar words have been used to describe his adaptation. Screen praised the “poignant exploration of loneliness, old age and the pitfalls and pleasures of remaining resolutely stuck in your ways,” and The Grump was Finland’s most-watched movie in 2014. But for a director still in his 30s, why make a film whose protagonist is well into the twilight of life?<p><p>“I made the film for my father,” Karukoski says with a smile. “He is kind of a grump: he complains about things and he’s agitated. Actually, it was his idea that the film should be called ‘The Grump.’ He has self-irony.”<p><p>Karukoski achieved critical and commercial success when his first films burst onto the scene.Photo: Pekka Mustonen/Helsinki-filmi Ltd<p><p>Son of American actor, writer and poet George Dickerson, Karukoski was born in Cyprus and moved to Finland when he was four-and-a-half. He grew up his mother’s country; his multicultural background would go on to inform his cinematic style.<p><p>Critical and commercial success was immediate when he burst onto the scene with the comedy-drama Beauty and the Bastard in 2006. Industry recognition was also swift: he won Best Director at the Finnish National Film Awards for his sophomore effort, The Home of Dark Butterflies, two years later.<p><p>Karukoski traversed the country in search of interesting stories, not interested in confining himself to any one genre or particular approach. His fourth full-length, Lapland Odyssey, saw him head far north in 2010 with hilarious results. The year’s biggest draw at the domestic box office, Karukoski’s film “showed the stubbornness of the Finnish mentality,” with a warm-hearted take on life in Finnish Lapland.<p><p>In 2013, Heart of a Lion cemented Karukoski’s reputation as a filmmaker. “The film finds a way to mix hatred with humour,” observed the Los Angeles Times. In the movie, a neo-Nazi is forced to confront his ideology when he falls in love with a woman whose son is biracial.<p><p>The resultant wave of critical acclaim saw him join Variety’s list of ten directors to watch.<p><p>Karukoski (centre, light shirt) takes a seat during the shooting of “The Home of Dark Butterflies.”Photo: Solar Films<p><p>However, even with the seductive charms of Hollywood beckoning, Karukoski’s attitude has remained pragmatically Finnish when looking for future projects.<p><p>“It’s not about the country, it’s about finding a good story that you relate to. I always like to make emotional films about real people. I am half-American, so it wouldn’t be a problem to go overseas, but it’s not an obsession. If there’s a good script or a good book, then why not?”<p><p>For the time being, Karukoski is focused on what promises to be his most ambitious project yet: a film about the iconic Finnish gay artist Tom of Finland. [Editor’s update: The film Tom of Finland, released in early 2017, gets some space in our Tom of Finland article; link below.]<p><p>“After I read a couple of biographies, I was totally startled by the character and his history. It is difficult to put a person’s life into two hours, but we want to make a good script before we shoot it.”<p><p>When it is eventually released, the film will be greeted by Finnish cinemagoers hungry for local stories. With the film industry here in its strongest position in years, Karukoski feels that it’s high time to utilise the support of the public. Given the bold subject matter of his forthcoming work, Karukoski will be leading by example.<p><p>“I think Finnish filmmakers should be courageous,” he says. “Now that we have the audience, we shouldn’t be afraid of losing them. We should offer them something more and different and unique.”<p><p>New to Finnish cinema?

We asked two insiders for tips on how to soak up jubilee fever – and we find out what Sibelius and heavy metal have in common.<p><p>Finnish pianist Folke Gräsbeck is dedicated to Sibelius, having performed two-thirds of his approximately 600 works, including premieres of 90 rare and newly discovered pieces. Gräsbeck selected the soundtrack, including some of his own recordings, that accompanied Sibelius and the World of Art, an exhibition at Helsinki’s Ateneum Art Museum (through March 22, 2015).<p><p>In April, Gräsbeck released an album featuring Sibelius’s own piano, recorded at Sibelius’s home, known as Ainola and located about 40 kilometres north of Helsinki near the town of Järvenpää. The Steinway itself, a 50th-birthday gift to the composer, is now a century old.<p><p>“It’s a pure pleasure to play, with a warm, subtle, lyrical sound,” says Gräsbeck, “and there are certainly spiritual vibrations in the air of that house.”<p><p>Along with conductor Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, Gräsbeck plays on many tracks of BIS Records’ recently completed set of all known Sibelius pieces.<p><p>“One main feature in all [of Sibelius’s] pieces is a strong melodic presence,” says pianist and Sibelius expert Folke Gräsbeck.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>“Now that we have this 68-CD box set, it’s possible to listen to Sibelius’s entire repertoire from 1883 to 1931,” says Gräsbeck. “One main feature in all the pieces is a strong melodic presence. Even in his youthful works, you have captivating melodies. He didn’t yet have the Kalevala romantic vocabulary that he reached in Kullervo and Lemminkäinen and the big orchestral works. But this sense of having an intense melody – it was there from the start.”<p><p>Gräsbeck champions Sibelius’s lesser-known works, many of which he believes to give true listening pleasure, perspective and depth in addition to the narrow selection of a very few “greatest hits” such as Finlandia, Valse triste, the Violin Concerto and the seven symphonies.<p><p>The pianist showcased both obscure gems and well-known works at his own festival on the island of southwestern Finnish island of Korpo. In July 2015, the event starred the Flinders Quartet from Australia. During 2015 Gräsbeck also played in Berlin, Tel Aviv and the Finnish city of Lahti, whose Sibelius Hall is “by far the best place to hear his music,” he says. “It has such excellent acoustics.”<p><p>Lahti’s Sibelius Festival featured the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Finnish star conductors such as Vänskä, Leif Segerstam, Jukka-Pekka Saraste and Sakari Oramo.<p><p>Gräsbeck has also recorded with Sibelius’s granddaughter, Satu Jalas. She inherited Sibelius’s own violin, bought by his sea captain uncle, Jean. Young Johan Julius Christian Sibelius, already known by the nickname Janne, adopted his uncle’s cosmopolitan name, and it stuck. Jalas’s sister Aino is a professional oboist whose son Lauri Porra is one of Finland’s leading film composers and bassists, with experience spanning pop, jazz and rock.<p><p>“If you’re interested in Finnish metal, then you should definitely check out Sibelius,” says Lauri Porra, Sibelius’s great-grandson.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>Porra sometimes plays bars of his great-grandfather’s famous piece Finlandia when taking a bass solo with his best-selling heavy metal band, Stratovarius.<p><p>“If you’re interested in Finnish metal, then you should definitely check out Sibelius,” he says. “His style has influenced all Finnish music – metal especially, because it’s very harmonic and has a National Romantic side to it. Metal and classical are actually quite close. Sibelius used a lot of influences from old Karelian [eastern Finnish] folklore and Kalevala [the Finnish national epic] in his work. So do Finnish metal bands like Amorphis.”<p><p>“Everybody in Finland studies this runic tradition. It’s a flat key and it’s a bit melancholic. This is what you can hear in Sibelius as well as in Finnish metal. The bigger, more melodic bands like Stratovarius, Amorphis, Nightwish and Sonata Arctica are all influenced by Sibelius in some way. Most Finnish metal players have some kind of classical background, which of course includes playing Sibelius.”<p><p>Porra’s mother, who knew her own grandfather well, heads up the Sibelius family commission that oversaw the 2015 jubilee year.<p><p>“Visit Ainola [the house where Sibelius lived and worked], because it’s one of the best-kept home museums in the world,” Porra says.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>“The nice thing is that people are not just doing obvious Sibelius things in 2015,” says Porra. “For instance, the Avanti! chamber orchestra is reinterpreting some of his music for plays and ballets. I’m taking part in my own way: touring 150 schools in the spring, playing Sibelius songs and improvising.”<p><p>February 12, 2015 marked the premiere of Porra’s concerto for electric bass and orchestra with the Lahti Symphony at Sibelius Hall. Around the same time, he released his third solo album, Flyover, an instrumental project featuring a symphony orchestra.<p><p>“Even if you’re not interested in the music of Sibelius, you should visit Ainola, because it’s one of the best-kept home museums in the world, and there are lots of other artists’ houses nearby in the Lake Tuusula area,” he says. “We still have family events there, such as Aino’s birthday, or just go there and have a cup of coffee.”<p><p>Porra fondly remembers his grandmother, Margareta, who told him “lots of funny stories” about her father.<p><p>“Sibelius had a much bigger impact on the Finnish mentality than just music. After all, he and these other artists helped to create the national identity. There’s even a saying that Finns are defined by ‘sauna, sisu and Sibelius.’”<p><p>By Wif Stenger, January 2015<p><p>Five decades in 68 CDs<p><p>Sibelius the godfather of metal?<p><p>The building blocks of Finnish identity<p>", "time": "2015-01-19T10:01:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

In 2015, the 150th anniversary of his birth is celebrated all year with events in Finland and around the world, from Iceland to Swaziland.<p><p>Born in 1865, Jean Sibelius lived a long and colourful life, surviving to the age of almost 92 despite a fondness for cigars and alcohol. He published no major works after the age of 61, and is believed to have burned his nearly complete Eighth Symphony in 1945. By then he had become the best-known Nordic composer – and the world’s best-known Finn. His status is being celebrated and revisited throughout 2015.<p><p>The jubilee year kicks off on New Year’s Day in Hämeenlinna, where he lived until he was almost 20. The town also hosts exhibitions, a festival (September) and an international congress (December).<p><p>Around the world, from São Paulo, Brazil to Melbourne, Australia, hundreds of Sibelius concerts, festivals, competitions and exhibitions are being held, and myriad books and albums are being published.<p><p>In Finland, events include cellist Jussi Makkonen’s Return to the Landscapes of Sibelius’s Honeymoon. It premieres on January 18 in Järvenpää, 40 kilometres north of Helsinki, near Sibelius’s former home, Ainola, which is now a museum.

The exhibition’s evocative multimedia experience includes famous Finnish paintings and music.<p><p>Sibelius formed close ties to artists such as Akseli Gallen-Kallela. In the 1890s, they held notorious parties at Helsinki’s Kämp restaurant, sometimes lasting for days. Between toasts, they discussed the budding Finnish nation and the essence of art.<p><p>“Inspiration went both ways: music inspired artworks, and art inspired Sibelius,” says Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff, chief curator of the Ateneum show. “Sibelius and Gallen-Kallela shared a new concept of art, Gesamtkunstwerk [a German term meaning ‘total work of art’ or ‘all-embracing art form’], which was a leading idea within symbolism. Both were particularly inspired by the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, from the 1880s through the 1920s.”<p><p>Sibelius was said to be gifted with synesthesia – “seeing” his own compositions and other music as visual works of art in his mind. According to his close friend and biographer Karl Ekman, “every impression of sound was transferred and fixed as colour on the retina of his eye.” Appropriately, the artwork in the show is accompanied by a tailored soundtrack, selected and sometimes played by Finnish pianist Folke Gräsbeck.<p><p>By Wif Stenger, December 2014<p><p>Notorious parties<p>", "time": "2015-01-27T08:39:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

His mixed background lets him provide viewers – and festival-goers – with new answers to classic questions of gender roles and migration.<p><p>Adel Abidin moved to Finland in 2001 with the woman who is now his ex-wife, and graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Helsinki in 2005. Since then he has worked as a visual artist both in Finland and abroad. For example, he represented Finland in the 2007 Venice Biennial with his multimedia installation Abidin Travels, which promoted a fake travel agency selling exotic trips to war-ridden Baghdad.<p><p>Abidin’s Marilyn Monroe pose, from an installation at Flow Fest.Photo: Adel Abidin<p><p>At Flow Festival, Abidin exhibited three mixed-media installations dealing with human rights, discrimination and gender issues.<p><p>Abidin is based in Helsinki and considers it his home. “My studio is here, although my family lives in Amman,” he says. “I have lots of shows abroad and I’m always going back and forth. So it’s kind of convenient.”<p><p>He finds it rather easy being an artist in Finland. Abidin says that Finland has had a huge impact on his career: “Look at the grant system and the funding. They support culture. They support the young generation. When you have a good project they give you funding – they even push you forward.”<p><p>“Finland is a very interesting place to be, and although it was all unplanned, I like it here,” he says. “The people I work with are very professional. Of course I don’t like winter, but there is no ideal place on this earth.”<p><p>“Love for you is a duty,” an installation in collaboration with singer Astrid Swan, makes festival-goers think about women’s roles in society.Photo: Anna Ruohonen<p><p>The themes of Abidin’s work stem from society: “Everything that happens in a society will affect us. We think we are separated, but the world is actually a really tiny place.”<p><p>Abidin deals with many classic themes, which he laces with sarcasm and paradox: gender matters, wars, love, discrimination, manipulation, authority. “We suffer from them, or we might benefit from them. So I think it’s very interesting to deal with them using my contemporary language. By mixing the two cultural backgrounds I have, the Western and the Middle Eastern, I end up with the third culture, a third answer.”<p><p>Abidin works with videos, video installations, photography, sound installations, sculpture and other media. “Each concept decides what kind of medium it needs to be presented with,” he explains. “I don’t force the medium on a concept.”<p><p>Which side are you on? Abidin’s labels entice curious viewers to explore an installation.Photo: Anna Ruohonen<p><p>The pieces shown at Flow Festival were made especially for the festival. “I’ve never been to Flow Festival before; I’m not a big fan of festivals, so this was a great opportunity to do something for a new audience. When you show a piece in a museum, people who go and visit your piece are set in their brain to see art. But when you show a piece at a festival people are not set for it”, Abidin says.<p><p>The festival pieces are related to the classic concepts Abidin works with, but he says he lightened them up considering the atmosphere of the festival. One of the Flow pieces was a song, co-written in collaboration with Finnish singer Astrid Swan.<p><p>This was a new method for Abidin, who believes that the beauty of doing art lies in challenging oneself: “Before this festival I’d never written lyrics before – I’m bad at music. However the piece turned out exactly as I planned.”<p><p> <p><p>By Anna Ruohonen, October 2014<p><p>A pleasure to be an artist in Finland<p><p>Classic themes not yet resolved<p><p>Flow pieces<p>", "time": "2014-10-31T16:42:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Held biannually, it attracts some of the biggest personalities in genre film.<p><p>Finland has made a name for itself with a variety of film events, including Love &amp; Anarchy, Espoo Ciné and the Midnight Sun Film Festival, held in Finnish Lapland. Night Visions deserves to be mentioned among these top names. Guests have included directors Dario Argento, Paul Verhoeven and Lloyd Kaufman, actor Christopher Lee, and director and actor John Waters.<p><p>The festival was born in the spring of 1997, starting out as a single night of back-to-back programming from dusk to dawn. For audiences starved for big-screen genre films, Night Visions shone a welcome spotlight on less likely favourites from both Finland and abroad.<p><p>“We were young and crazy enough to think that this was a good idea, even though we didn’t have any financial backing,” recalls festival director Mikko Aromaa, who founded Night Visions with a handful of other self-proclaimed “film geeks.” “It seemed completely logical that we could finance all of this with box office revenues only.”<p><p><p><p> <p><p>It immediately became apparent that Aromaa and his friends were not alone. By the autumn of 1998 the festival had outgrown the small cinema where it started, and shifted its base to Finland’s oldest cinema house, Maxim.<p><p>Subsequent years saw attendance numbers growing gradually, before the decision was made in 2008 to go full throttle and expand the festival.<p><p>“We are now the second-biggest film festival in Helsinki that focuses on fiction films,” says Aromaa. “Nobody would have believed that if you had told them ten years ago.”<p><p>Currently around 65 features are included in the line-up each year, with a total number of admissions in the vicinity of 14,500 for its spring and autumn editions. Along with the growth of the audience, the cinematic offerings have expanded, with the programme now incorporating some mainstream elements as well.<p><p>“We’re the Flow Festival of film,” Aromaa explains, tipping his hat to Helsinki’s renowned music festival. “We try to be on the edge, introducing cool things to the audience, but still hold on to the backbone of the festival, the genre stuff.”<p><p>True to its humble roots, Night Visions remains noncompetitive. However, the movie-goers get to vote for the Night Visions Audience Award.<p><p><p><p> <p><p>Thanks to Night Visions, the local genre-film scene has enjoyed a subsequent boost in profile.<p><p>“The festival is important for Finnish genre films because, in addition to great programming, it always brings some of the more forgotten, awesome films back to the limelight,” says Timo Vuorensola, director of 2011’s homegrown cult favourite Iron Sky. “Night Visions is the best film festival experience I’ve ever been to. It’s the right size, has the reputation to get good guests and is always interesting and surprising, programming-wise.”<p><p>And so, whether it’s sharing a drink with Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, spending a week in Helsinki with cult actor Udo Kier or enjoying the company of the revered John Waters, festival director Aromaa clearly loves what he’s doing.<p><p>It’s also clear that he has a grander vision for Night Visions.<p><p>“There are still a lot of possibilities to make it even greater,” he says. “It is still a hobby to me, but it is close to becoming a profession.

Her following novels, True and The Book of Strangers, confirmed her success.<p><p>Pulkkinen’s second bestseller, True, was translated into many languages, including English, in 2012. Her thrilling debut novel, The Limit, published in English in 2013 and recently made into a TV miniseries in Finland, deals with fundamental themes of literature and ancient tragedy: fate versus free choice; law versus inner ethical principles; death and love.<p><p>“On the day Anja Aropalo decided to die, the weather was as sweet and dense as a web of sugar,” the novel begins. The 53-year-old, childless literature professor uses pills to write the words “misery”, “life”, “burden” and “love” and then swallows the words. But the suicide does not succeed.<p><p>Riikka Pulkkinen’s debut novel has been made into a TV miniseries in Finland.Photo: Mikko Stig/Lehtikuva<p><p>The book is about suicide, death fantasies and euthanasia. It also examines the conflicts that result from Anja’s niece Mary becoming a woman while Anja is coming to grips with aging.<p><p>Anja’s husband, an architect who finds himself “at the mouth of the tunnel of oblivion,” asks his wife to kill him as soon as Alzheimer’s disease takes full control of him.<p><p>“Anja looked into her husband’s eyes and realised that two worlds had distanced themselves from each other,” Pulkkinen writes. Anja has to choose between love, loyalty to her husband, her own ambivalent feelings and the law that prohibits euthanasia.<p><p>Meanwhile her self-mutilating, rebellious, 16-year-old niece Mary, finding herself trapped in a destructive love affair with her married teacher Julian, believes that “thinking about death is a game.”<p><p>The fates of women and girls play a central role in Pulkkinen’s novels.Cover: Scribe Publications<p><p>“Love and desire, where is the borderline?” the teacher asks his class. The book’s title in Finnish, Raja, translates as “border” or “limit.” The book talks about outer limits and borderline situations, which differ depending on a person’s age.<p><p>“On one hand, the novel is about the request: ‘Kill me!’” says Pulkkinen, a sensitive author and columnist, born in 1980 in the northern Finnish city of Oulu. “Mary asks the teacher Julian to do it and Anja’s husband begs Anja to do it.<p><p>“On the other hand, there is still the commandment, ‘Thou shalt not kill!’ The theme of the novel emerges from these contradictory requests and demands. How can you kill one and at the same time save the other?”<p><p>Pulkkinen wanted to examine the clash of laws, requests and desire in the context of life, death and love. “Through this, a tragedy or metatragedy developed, a form I also wanted to explore.”<p><p>Pulkkinen describes herself as a person who worries a little too much.Photo: Jouni Harala/Otava<p><p>Pulkkinen, a former athlete who describes herself as a person who worries a little too much, is interested in “questions about life and existence, to which I am looking for fundamental answers in my prose.”<p><p>Her novel Vieras (The Book of Strangers), published in Finnish in 2012, deals with otherness, migrants, culture, religion and body image in Finnish society. Finland was homogenous for a long time, in contrast to the melting pot of New York, which also features in the novel.<p><p>“A person can set foot in a new land,” the book says. “The land will receive her. Yet she remains a stranger as she is a stranger unto herself, as long as she carries within her that voiceless unknown that bears no name.”<p><p>Again, the fates of women and girls play a central role. According to Pulkkinen, the Finnish model of a woman has always been that of a victim and was based on stories of struggles against society.<p><p>“But Finnish society has become more egalitarian than its cultural image of women,” says Pulkkinen, who has a young daughter. “Women authors always used to write at night, and the rest of the time they took care of their children, home and possibly a day job. It is good that nowadays Finnish women can hand over their children to a kindergarten teacher, go work on a novel in a café, and then even go for a manicure.” Pulkkinen smiles.<p><p> <p><p>By Rebecca Libermann, October 2014<p><p>Tunnel of oblivion<p><p>Drawing the line<p><p>Being a stranger<p>", "time": "2015-02-20T08:45:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Her Snow White trilogy projects the excitement of a thriller and the wonder of a fairy tale.<p><p>Simukka’s own story almost sounds like a fairy tale. Apart from the long-standing fame of Tove Jansson and her Moomin characters, Finnish children’s and youth literature was not enjoying visibility on the international level. Then some clever publisher came up with the idea of investing more in this literary genre, and lo and behold, interest abroad gradually rose. Simukka became the princess in this story.<p><p>“She was the puzzle piece that didn’t have its own place but could suddenly fill in almost any hole you needed it to. She wasn’t like the others. She was exactly like the others.” This is how the loner Lumikki, whose name is also the Finnish name for Snow White, describes herself in As Red as Blood, the first volume of a new youth thriller trilogy by Simukka.<p><p>Part of it could also apply to the writer herself, who says, “I am sociable and at the same time a recluse. I need lots of solitude.”<p><p>The numerous books of the award-winning author, translator and literary critic (born in 1981) enjoy great popularity in Finland. Her novels Jäljellä (Without a Trace) and Toisaalla (Elsewhere), both of which are set in the near future, brought her the Topelius Prize for children’s and youth literature in January 2013.<p><p>Simukka’s books, which include elements of fairy tales and thrillers, are described as “captivating.”Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>The vivid, extremely exciting Lumikki trilogy is being released simultaneously in more than 40 countries – a sensational achievement by any measure. The books brought Simukka the Finnish Ministry of Culture’s Finland Prize in December 2013 in recognition of her significant artistic achievement.<p><p>According to Simukka, people commonly assume that young people as a group have homogenous reading habits. She insists that this is not true.<p><p>“The best way to ensure that young people will continue reading is to offer them a wide range of high-quality, interesting and exciting literature.” And that’s what Simukka does.<p><p>“We’re all aware that young readers read significantly less than before, but Simukka is captivating,” says Iris Schwank, director of the Finnish Literature Exchange (FILI), an institution that promotes awareness of Finnish literature abroad. “She is popular and attracts new readers. Her protagonist is a bold girl who questions everything, but in a humorous way.”<p><p>Simukka’s books appear in English, German and several dozen other languages.Cover art: Skyscape<p><p>As Red as Blood shows readers a young Russian woman found dead in a pool of her own blood. A bunch of blood-stained money and Lumikki’s inadvertent involvement in the drug trade soon enter the picture. It’s a murder mystery, but it also deals with youth archetypes and even a touch of the collective unconscious.<p><p>“There once was a girl who learned to fear,” forms one of the key sentences of the book for Simukka. This sentence alone shows that the book contains many fairy-tale elements on levels of language, narrative and symbolism, although it reads like a thriller.<p><p>Simukka debuted as a 21-year-old with Kun enkelit katsovat muualle (When Angels Look Away), a romantic story between two girls. She calls herself a very visual person: “My writing process often begins with the title and usually with some powerful images, from which I’ll let the story evolve.”<p><p>In the first book of the trilogy, she conjures up the picture of red blood seeping into fresh snow. The winter itself also plays a large role, both symbolically and visually. “I love art and try to write so that the reader can clearly picture the events,” says Simukka.<p><p>“I love art and try to write so that the reader can clearly picture the events,” says Simukka.Photo: Lars Kastila<p><p>Simukka was born in the southern Finnish industrial city of Tampere, where her heroine Lumikki attends a school of performing arts. Simukka’s books, whether dystopias or fairy-tale thrillers, often handle the everyday problems of adolescents.<p><p>The slightly moralistic Snow White trilogy follows the maturation of the withdrawn, sarcastic 17-year-old Lumikki, whose childhood included bullying and other trauma, and shows how she overcomes her fears and eventually builds up her self-confidence.<p><p>The idea for the trilogy came to Simukka while she was browsing in a Frankfurt bookstore in the spring of 2011. She now presents the finished product in the very same city at the Frankfurt Book Fair 2014.<p><p>“At the store I suddenly thought it would be interesting to write thrillers for young adults,” she says. “And once I had thought up the title As Red as Blood, which I found fitting for a crime novel, it was clear that As White as Snow, and As Black as Ebony had to follow.”<p><p>The remaining two parts of the trilogy, released in Finnish in 2013 and 2014, with English versions slated for 2015, reveal an unholy cult and Lumikki’s alleged half-sister in Prague, not to mention a dangerous stalker, a first love and revelations of the past.<p><p>By Rebecca Libermann, September 2014<p><p>Young people read if books speak their language<p><p>Fairy-tale thriller<p><p>Blood, snow and ebony<p>", "time": "2014-10-21T14:06:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Cool.”<p><p>Finnish literature is characterized by its great diversity, ranging from children’s literature, crime novels, comics and fantasy all the way to belles lettres and poetry. “We have so many voices, so many expressions, so many topics that you can hardly list them all,” says Iris Schwanck, director of the Finnish Literature Exchange (FILI), an institution that promotes awareness of Finnish literature abroad.<p><p>Johanna Holmström, a Swedish-speaking Finn, deals with questions of women’s rights and religion in her book “Asphalt Angel”.Photo: Riikka Hurri<p><p>Around 60 Finnish authors appear at the book fair. “Writing is equal to existing,” says Estonian Finnish author Sofi Oksanen, who is unsurpassable as a chronicler of Estonian history. “If you record things, you capture time.” The internationally acclaimed, award-winning writer, known for her novel Purge (2010), is one of the most memorable and most outspoken voices of Finland.<p><p>With the third book of her series When the Doves Disappeared coming out in English 2015, she belongs to the younger Finnish literary generation’s sociocritical handling of the Second World War in both Finland and Estonia. Her peers include Katja Kettu, one of Finland’s emerging powerful and eloquent writers, and Kjell Westö, who is immensely popular in Finland as a chronicler of Helsinki and its society.<p><p>“Nowadays, the topics are often very political, even when seen from a personal microperspective,” explains Maria Antas, head of literature programme at FILI. “A decade ago we had lots of books telling sad family stories.”<p><p>Overall, Finland’s recent literature has become more global, more urban and to some extent, more satirical. It puts people and the challenges that they face in today’s world in the spotlight. “In quite many books, there are characters from Muslim cultures,” says Antas. “This is a brand new phenomenon in Finland.” For instance Johanna Holmström’s novel Asfaltsänglar (Asphalt Angels) shows, as Holmström says, that “every woman, whether Western or non-Western, wears a price tag.” The author writes in Swedish, one of Finland’s official languages.<p><p>Author, screenwriter and comic book writer Johanna Sinisalo coined the genre name Finnish Weird.Photo: Timo Jaakonaho/Lehtikuva<p><p>Ninety new crime novels are published in Finland each year.

Ilkka Remes and Taavi Soininvaara are masters of the political and psychological thriller. Emerging stars include Kati Hiekkapelto and Antti Tuomainen, while Risto Isomäki, a scientist and environmental activist, shines with his eco-thrillers and science fiction.<p><p>Science fiction also plays a role in a uniquely Finnish literary genre called Finnish Weird, a whimsical, satirical and futuristic mix of science fiction, fantasy and satire, Nordic mythology and also sometimes horror, full of bizarre characters and plot lines.

She was also an icon of the Finnish gay and lesbian movement, a trailblazer for Finland’s extensive female comics scene and more.<p><p>“She was a multitalented workaholic, very much alive,” says the renowned art historian and essayist Tuula Karjalainen, whose wonderfully vivid biography Tove Jansson: Work and Love appears in 12 languages in 2014. “She had tremendous will power. Her great passions were the arts, people, life and love.” Jansson and her books form one of the focal points for Finland at the Frankfurt Book Fair.<p><p>Thanks in part to Jansson, Finland’s comics scene is thriving for both children and adults. It contains room for experimental projects, and is even supported by the state. It’s also “very heavily dominated by women,” says Antas.<p><p>“On a global scale this is amazing.

{"title": "Celebrating Moomin-maker Tove Jansson - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/celebrating-moomin-maker-tove-jansson/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The year 2014 marked the centenary of Tove Jansson’s birthday. Her international fame stems from the Moomin adventures, which she wrote and illustrated, but there’s much more to her than that.<p><p>Tove Jansson (1914–2001) led a remarkable life and remains one of Finland’s most beloved artists and authors. The immensely popular Moomins, although they are called trolls, actually possess surprisingly human traits. They are a curious group of creatures whose foibles and philosophising appeal to both kids and grown-ups.<p><p>This detail from an early, undated Moomin illustration by Tove Jansson shows Snufkin on a horse (left) and the Moomin family around a campfire (at right, beside tent). Click picture to see an uncropped version.Photo: Tampere Art Museum, © Moomin Characters<p><p>The characters first appeared in novels, then in comic strips and later in animated films. Jansson wrote the Moomin stories in Swedish, her native language and one of Finland’s official languages. The books stretch over four decades of her career, from the 1940s to ’70s. The first English translation was published in 1951 – several years before a Finnish-language version appeared.<p><p>A glance at the table of contents for Comet in Moominland, the first of the books to appear in English, provides a taste of the story’s swashbuckling adventures, humorous antics, philosophical insight and captivating cast of characters.<p><p>Here’s a sampling of the chapter descriptions: “Moomintroll and Sniff following a mysterious path to the sea,” “Moomintroll rescues the Snork Maiden from a poisonous bush,” “a fantastic crossing of the dried-up sea,” “a swarm of grass-hoppers,” “a coffee party” and, last but not least, “Chapter 12, which is about the end of the story.” The book’s settings include a cave, an underground river, an observatory and a party in the forest.<p><p>Tove (left), shown here with her partner Tuulikki, spent most of each summer on an island off of southern Finland. The sea and the archipelago figure in many of her books.Photo: Per Olov Jansson/Moomin Characters<p><p>Many people don’t know that Jansson wrote novels and short stories for a grown-up audience, as well. Over the past several years, Sort Of Books has published these works in beautiful, new, English-language versions. Some of them are appearing in English for the first time ever.<p><p>In the introduction to Fair Play, Ali Smith says, “in her writing for adults Jansson was also, in her own quiet way, quite radical both with form and subject matter.” Jansson’s stylistic clarity “makes for mysterious transparency,” and her books describe “people not usually included or given that much space” in literature.<p><p>Fair Play forms a collection of autobiographical stories that relate parts of Jansson’s life with her partner Tuulikki. They were together for more than 40 years. Other Jansson books published under the Sort Of imprint include The Summer Book and Sculptor’s Daughter, both of which are considered classics, and four others.<p><p>Penguin released another Jansson-related book in December 2014, a new biography by Tuula Karjalainen entitled Tove Jansson: Work and Love (published in Finnish by Tammi as Tove Jansson – Tee työtä ja rakasta).<p><p>In addition to providing insight into Jansson’s versatile career as a writer and a visual artist, Karjalainen shows us how bold Jansson was in choosing her path in life. She lived with a man without being married – a scandalous development in those days. She also had relationships with women – these connections were open secrets in Helsinki at a time (the 1940s and ’50s) when such a relationship could still lead to jail or a mental hospital.<p><p>Detail from a self-portrait, “Lynx Boa” (1942). Click picture to see an uncropped version.Photo: Finnish Nat’l Gallery/Yehia Eweis, © Tove Jansson Estate<p><p>Another side of Jansson unfamiliar to many Moomin fans is her painting career. Despite the eventual success of the Moomin books and her books for adults, Jansson herself considered painting her main professional calling for much of her life. During one phase of her career, Jansson supported herself by painting monumental wall murals for various government and corporate buildings.<p><p>Karjalainen says that Jansson was late in joining the wave of abstractionism that reached Finland in the 1950s, although she later produced fine work in that genre. In an interview for this article, Karjalainen suggests that Jansson did not take readily to abstractionism because she was “a storyteller by nature,” in painting as well as in literature.<p><p>In the less-than-open-minded art circles of mid-20th-century Helsinki, Jansson’s storytelling talent, success and versatility seem to have inspired some degree of jealousy. For much of the 1950s, she supported herself – and her other art – by writing and illustrating Moomin comic strips for England’s Evening News. “When she met artists [in Helsinki],” says Karjalainen, “she got a lot of negative feedback. It got so bad that she had to change her phone number because she’d get calls telling her that she’d sold her soul to commercialism.”<p><p>“It’s difficult for us to imagine today, but that’s the way it was.”<p><p>By Peter Marten, March 2014, updated September 2014<p><p>Beyond the Moomin books<p><p>Paintings, murals and art circles<p>", "time": "2014-10-01T07:19:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The Sibelius Academy added formal jazz studies to its syllabus in 1983, a move that the Helsinki Pop &amp; Jazz Conservatory had already made in 1972.<p><p>“There are now at least two generations of jazz musicians who are experienced professional musicians and excellent performers or composers,” explains Perko, who is himself a graduate of the Sibelius Academy.<p><p>Perko says the jazz boom in Finland started “more than ten years ago, but perhaps because clubs and concert venues are currently more established, jazz now has the ability to reach audiences more easily. It has become closer to the people.”<p><p>Soulful vocalists Tuomas Prättälä (left) and Emma Salokoski are some of the singers who can be heard at jazz festivals in Finland.Photo courtesy of Viapori Jazz<p><p>Finnish jazz is often considered within what is known as Scandinavian jazz. “Finnish jazz has plenty of design,” explains Perko enthusiastically. “It’s more minimalistic. It’s similar to our design, with simple lines, perhaps more edgy. But I believe this can be said about Scandinavian jazz in general.”<p><p>He paraphrases a famous quote from renowned Finnish classical composer Jean Sibelius: “Don’t write any unnecessary musical notes!” Perko is referring to an aspect of Finnish culture – and hence Finnish music.<p><p>“Our extreme winter weather conditions have forced us to be accurate when sowing and harvesting the crop,” says Perko, himself the son of a farmer. “We couldn’t afford to lose or waste anything. It was all about precision and hard work, weeding out what was unnecessary – like in our music.”<p><p>In Helsinki, Finnish jazz can be heard at venues such as Koko Jazz Club, We Jazz and Nyyrikki Jazz. The southwestern city of Turku has its well-established Jazz Club Monk, and in Tampere, two hours north of Helsinki, Paapan Kapakka hosts jazz gigs daily, often by the house band.<p><p>The young trio HERD has been known to perform with singer Aili Ikonen as Jazzbasilli.Photo courtesy of Viapori Jazz<p><p>Every August the picturesque island fortress of Suomenlinna, just off the coast of Helsinki, hosts the Viapori Jazz Festival, known for its all-Finnish programme. “It’s important to have a festival where our musicians have the main role,” says Perko. “There are enough fests with famous international artists. But I’m not interested in that. I want to keep our festival small and local.”<p><p>“Viapori includes anything that sounds interesting or different or is fun,” says Perko. He compiles Viapori’s programme based on inspiration he gets from chats colleagues and friends or from simply “taking a walk with the dog in the forest.” Viapori’s wide-ranging selection attracts dabblers and connoisseurs alike.<p><p> <p><p>By Carina Chela, May 2013, updated September 2014<p><p>What makes Finnish jazz Finnish?<p><p>Cool hot island festival<p>", "time": "2014-09-09T08:04:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

They represent just a few of the elite musicians who own instruments by Nieminen’s company Versoul, a small shop tucked away in northern Helsinki.<p><p>Nieminen has travelled a remarkable career path to become a guitar maker whose instruments are in the hands of some of the most famous guitarists on earth.<p><p>“It was the music,” Nieminen says when asked about his initial vocational inspiration. Knowing that Finland alone was not large enough for someone to make a living building guitars, he had his eyes set on the international scene from the time he named his company. Versoul combines “versus” and “soul,” reflecting aspects of the company philosophy.<p><p>Raised in the northern Finnish city of Oulu, Nieminen started carving wood at the age of three, he says. He built his first guitar at 12, and received his first order at 17. What distinguishes Nieminen from other luthiers is that he chose to study industrial design, while remaining self-taught as a guitar builder.<p><p>Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top saw a phtoto of Versoul’s Blue Light Special and hastened to order one.Photo: Joel Nieminen<p><p>Nieminen’s final project was an experimental series of six acoustic steel-string flat top guitars. In 1998, the Association of Finnish Industrial Designers named Nieminen Industrial Designer of the Year; in 1999 his ZOEL steel-string flat top guitar was featured in a set of postal stamps commemorating top new Finnish designs products.<p><p>His experimentation with different materials earned him early recognition, and reflects his industrial design background. He has developed guitars using nontraditional materials such as fibreglass; his fibreglass flat top guitars also use a design that can be relatively rapidly produced, and have enjoyed wide recognition. Nieminen’s craftsmanship and experimentation with different neck designs and tonewoods give Versoul guitars their distinct sound.<p><p>The key to surviving in the industry depends on a number of factors. Mass-production can only reach so much of the market. The important thing is to gain a customer base. In 1995 Nieminen attended his first National Association for Music Merchants convention, where he made a deal with Westwood Music in Los Angeles to stock his guitars.<p><p>At Westwood Music, Roger Daltrey of The Who ran across a Versoul guitar and became enchanted with its sound. “Daltrey is a great person, and really wanted to help me out in the beginning,” says Nieminen. “He was a big fan of my sound. He called up people in the industry and said, ‘You have to try these.’” Daltrey helped put Nieminen in contact with the Rolling Stones and their renowned guitar technician Alan Rogan.<p><p>Rolling Stones member Ronnie Wood, one of Nieminen’s most famous customers, owns about ten Versoul instruments. When we dropped by Nieminen’s studio, he was getting yet another guitar ready to ship to Wood.<p><p>Guitar maker Kari Nieminen explains the finer points of one of his acoustic guitars.Photo: Pia Grochowski<p><p>One distinguishing feature of Nieminen’s instruments can be found in the gold designs. Some custom guitars, such as the Blue Light Special, include gold-leaf ornamentation. Versoul’s premium guitars are labelled and signed in gold leaf. Some of the artistic details can reflect Finnish origins: Nieminen’s famous shamanic designs, found on a number of his guitars, are inspired by Finnish cave paintings.<p><p>Nieminen keeps original models of all his instruments on his studio wall. One of them, the popular Blue Light Special, was inspired by and made for ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, who collects unusual guitars. Inspiration struck on an intercontinental flight when Nieminen thought up a guitar featuring a blue light that glows when the guitar is amplified. Gibbons saw photos of the Blue Light Special and quickly ordered one.<p><p>Living in Finland puts Nieminen in a prime position to find suitable wood for his instruments. Finnish alder forms one of his preferences, but he also experiments with other species. Birch, one of the most common trees in Finland, makes a nice tonewood for acoustic models. Aesthetics are also important when making a guitar, and Nieminen likes curly birch, which displays a wavy, resplendent pattern.<p><p> <p><p>By Pia Grochowski, April 2014<p><p>Getting into the business<p><p>Golden sound<p>", "time": "2014-04-15T07:28:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Visitors can concentrate on what is essential. The atmosphere is important. It’s governed by form and material – fir and black alder – and by light, which create the sacral ambience together.<p><p>Beauty opens the soul to religious and spiritual experiences. “I hope that the chapel will sensitise people to see beauty and kindness”, says pastor Tarja Jalli, executive director of the Chapel of Silence. “What’s more, I hope that people will start taking responsibility on the conservation and increase of the beauty of life.”<p><p>The wood of the chapel stands out from the stone, metal and glass of a hotel and a shopping centre nearby. “The exterior architecture of the chapel is consciously designed to form a great contrast with the surrounding buildings,” explains Summanen. “It has to possess a strong identity to hold its own in this large-scale, commercial, urban landscape. The shape and material of the building communicate different values.”<p><p>Yet the activity of the chapel doesn’t clash with the life of the surrounding area. “The chapel forms part of the big community of the neighbourhood of Kamppi,” says Jalli. It forms a link that “completes the comprehensive interpersonal encounters and services for people.” In other words, if chapel visitors leave feeling better or more peaceful, it makes a contribution to the overall atmosphere of the neighbourhood.<p><p>Inner sanctuary: The chapel offers quiet refuge.Photo: © K2S Architects Ltd<p><p>Churches are soothing places where connecting with the core of our being feels natural.

Fisticuffs, war, excitement, near-death experiences, long journeys. No, we’re not talking about ice hockey. We’re reading the memoir of a Finnish Canadian.<p><p>Rauni Ollikainen’s self-published, cleverly titled book Finnish Beginnings opens with screaming. As she is born in a Helsinki hospital, bombs are falling outside, part of the Second World War. She spends her first hours alive in an underground shelter.<p><p>Told from a little girl’s perspective informed by the insight and hindsight of an adult, Ollikainen’s story forms an exciting and touching story that overlaps with major events in Finnish history. It also makes you want to know what happened next, after the book finishes – more about that below.<p><p>She draws readers in with details of everyday life in post-war Finland, and opens a first-person window on the gritty immigrant experience. Ollikainen, her parents and her two sisters left Finland for a new start in British Columbia, Canada when she was eight years old.<p><p>Why did they leave? Whom did they leave behind? How did they adjust to their new country? These questions remain captivating more than six decades later, and they also make for a great story.<p><p>Rauni Ollikainen’s parents Taimi (left) and Sulo show off their first-born daughter Pirkko.Photo courtesy of Rauni Ollikainen<p><p>“Sometimes memories are just memories of memories,” Ollikainen says early in the book. Some of her first memories come from a voyage to Sweden at the age of 18 months. Nearly 70,000 Finnish kids lived with host families in Sweden to escape the dangers of war. Ollikainen returned two years later to a family and a language she barely recognised.<p><p>Her family lived in a two-room Helsinki apartment with her grandmother. When she was five they moved to a house in the country. Several years later they emigrated.<p><p>Before that, she and her younger sister each had a brush with death. (We won’t spoil the story, though.) Ollikainen also overheard the grown-ups discussing life and politics often enough to be able to fill in the reasons that led her family and many others to emigrate.<p><p>During her childhood, war remained fresh in people’s minds – the Second World War (which Finnish historians divide into the Winter War of 1939–40, the Continuation War of 1941–44 and the Lapland War of 1944–45) and the short but brutal Finnish Civil War of 1918, just months after Finland’s declaration of independence from Russia.<p><p>Winter camouflage: Finnish ski troops such as these fought on the eastern front during the Winter War.Photo: SA-kuva<p><p>She remembers her father’s Winter War stories. He didn’t hate Russians, but he hated Stalin and he hated having to kill people, Ollikainen writes. “Couldn’t you just make a deal with every Russian you came across and tell them that you wouldn’t kill them if they wouldn’t kill you?” she asked her dad as a little girl.<p><p>“It doesn’t work that way,” he answered. He added, “Maybe little girls should run the world.”<p><p>For a reader living in modern Finland, Ollikainen’s accounts of war and Finnish politics seem to draw upon various versions of Finnish history: the history-book version that tries for an impartial account; the version she observed and heard about as a small child; and other, possibly nostalgia-laden, versions from oral and written sources.<p><p>Helsinkians clean up rubble after a bomb attack during the Second World War. Memories of war played a role in the Ollikainens’ decision to emigrate.Photo: SA-kuva<p><p>Post-war Finland was wary of new conflicts in Russian-Finnish relations. Ollikainen’s parents decided to move to Canada, where they would never have to experience war again.<p><p>In detailing the bittersweet period before they left, she shows how various friends and relatives encouraged or discouraged her parents’ heartrending decision. Her grandmother chose to stay in Finland.<p><p>The family ends up on the west coast of Canada. Triumphs and setbacks follow: Ollikainen helps her father find his first job in Canada when she overhears some Finns talking about needing another worker to participate in building a dam up north.<p><p>They eventually establish themselves in their new country and discover vibrant Finnish communities in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island.<p><p>Rauni’s mother Taimi holds her hand as she takes some of her first steps in a Helsinki park.

So we contacted her and asked. “So many people ask me if I’m going to write a volume two,” Ollikainen says. “It’s a possibility.”<p><p>What happened to her parents? “My mother passed away 15 years after we moved to Canada,” she says, “and my father remarried, to a Finnish woman from Finland, and moved back.”<p><p>Did Ollikainen ever live in Finland again? Yes, about 25 years after leaving: “I lived and worked in Finland for almost a year.” Her son was 12 at the time. “His Finnish schoolmates were so proud that they had a real Canadian on their hockey team. As an adult, he is still interested in all things Finnish.”<p><p>Can she still speak Finnish? “[When I went back to Finland,] I stumbled a bit at first, but was surprised how quickly it came back. Of course, now that many Finns are joining my Finnish Beginnings Facebook page, I am having conversations in Finnish with Finns from Finland and all over the US and Canada. ”<p><p>“I’ve had many Finnish Canadians contact me, people who knew my parents and Finns who have heard about my memoir.

Several of Finland’s most successful designers make their homes abroad, and are showing the relevance of Finnish design in diverse cultural contexts.<p><p> Illustrator, graphic designer and art director Lotta Nieminen, who first got acquainted with the US during a semester on exchange at the Rhode Island School of Design, has been working in Brooklyn, New York for several years. Currently working at Studiomates, a collaborative workspace for designers, illustrators, writers and developers, Nieminen considers it essential to be around people, despite the individual character of her work.<p><p> With a current client list that includes work for the New York Times, Volkswagen and Hermès, Nieminen has established herself within a global scope of opportunities. She embraces cross-disciplinary working methods and has graphic and illustration projects “going on at the same time.”<p><p>Lotta Nieminen makes her home in Brooklyn, New York.Photo courtesy of Lotta Nieminen<p><p> A graduate of Helsinki’s Aalto University of Art and Design, she finds that graphic design offers the amalgam of what she “had always been interested in doing,” yet she only realised it when she became acquainted with the university’s department somewhat by accident.<p><p> Despite some rebellion against the artistic roots in her family background, her threats of becoming a lawyer or doctor gave way a repertoire that currently includes website design, photography, layout and even a children’s book that has been published in ten countries.<p><p> Nieminen does not perceive her work as purely Finnish, but as “the outcome of a larger growing experience, more than just cultural heritage,” she says. “I like to draw from it, but I am also constantly inspired by other aesthetics outside it. I feel like my conception of Nordic design has changed, looking at it from the outside, rather than as the insider I was [while living in Finland].”<p><p> What unifies and distinguishes Nordic design in Nieminen’s eyes involves a categorical melancholy and a directness that she says “goes hand in hand with the general mentality of the Finns. With only a short history of design, it’s easier to reinvent the wheel. I think this is also what makes Finnish design interesting.”<p><p>What’s Finnish about Pietari Posti’s work? “The prominence of nature, trees and forests,” he says.Illustration: Pietari Posti<p><p> Pietari Posti, a prolific Finnish graphic designer and illustrator, works in Barcelona, Spain. Posti graduated from the Lahti Institute of Art and Design, after which he began his career abroad.<p><p> His CV includes magazine illustrations; book covers for publishers in Finland and other countries; and cups and bowls for Iittala. Posti, in similarity to Nieminen, considers his work to derive from a range of cultural influences, mostly outside his native country.<p><p> “Most of my influences, whether comics from my adolescent days or graphic design, derive from abroad,” says Posti.<p><p> “Yet I’ve always admired Tove Jansson [the writer and artist who created the Moomin books] and her ability to create a world of fantasy that provides so much.”<p><p> He praises Finnish industrial design for its minimalist elements. “The prominence of nature, trees and forests forms a recurring ingredient in my work,” he says. “Perhaps this is something that I have incorporated from my Finnish upbringing.”<p><p>When Pietari Posti starts a project, sketching the first lines on paper or onscreen usually gets things flowing.Photo courtesy of Pietari Posti<p><p> It pleases Posti to witness the eminence of Finnish designers abroad: “I do follow modern graphic design to an extent, and I have to say it has been a delight to observe that Finnish designers and illustrators are well represented and recognised around the world.” Among them we could mention London-based designer and illustrator Klaus Haapaniemi; Paris-based graphic designers Anna Ahonen and Katariina Lamberg; shoe designer Minna Parikka; and clothing and accessory designer Paola Suhonen.<p><p> Reflecting the eclectic nature of design, Nieminen and Posti prefer different processes for capturing inspiration and working. The most essential tool for coordinating work with clients appears to be email. The rest may involve cultural activities, exhibitions or laidback free time to balance and complement various projects.<p><p> The simplest things can inspire a designer, such as colour combinations for Niemienen. She may get an idea from “a dark green sock next to a pale pink box, or a red jacket over a magenta collar shirt.”<p><p> Posti may struggle to get things started, he says, but sketching the first lines on paper or onscreen usually gets things flowing: “Nothing is difficult, really.

Yet those with open minds, 360-degree taste, experience and skills flourish by playing in a variety of bands and styles – which often overlap and mingle like the sounds, aromas and crowds at a street festival.<p><p>Rap and jazz, for instance, have overlapped since early-1970s LPs by the Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron. In later decades, rap DJs have used bebop samples, while many a jazz musician has featured a token rap track – sometimes with cringeworthy results.<p><p>Ricky-Tick Big Band has taken a giant step: their second album Burnaa features three of Finland’s most established rappers: Paleface, Redrama and Tommy Lindgren, known collectively as Julkinen Sana.<p><p>“So far we’re unaware of similar collaborations with a big band and rap,” says composer/producer Valtteri Pöyhönen, leader of the 17-member Ricky-Tick Big Band and the six-man Dalindèo. “We wrote most of the texts in sessions together over the pre-recorded big band tracks.”<p><p>The MCs rhyme back-to-back, grooving seamlessly with the 13-strong horn section during witty raps in Finnish and Swedish about addiction, xenophobia, the Moscow militia and the state of homegrown hip-hop. In between, Fredriksson plays fierce solos, as does trumpeter Kalevi Louhivuori.<p><p>The members of Helsinki band Dalindèo cultivate irreverent musical attitudes.Photo: Veikko Kähkönen<p><p>“Dalindèo has gotten feedback from a very varied audience for a long time, along the lines of, ‘I don’t really like jazz, but what you’re doing is great,’” says Pöyhönen. “It seems that the music just gets people, even before they realise that it’s jazz. It’s the same thing with Ricky-Tick Big Band.<p><p>“I’m very pleased about this because jazz seems to be a dirty word for a lot of people and I’d like to change that. And it seems to be working!”<p><p>Three of Dalindèo’s six members are also in Ricky-Tick Big Band. The former has been together for almost ten years, touring more than a dozen European countries. They started out playing bossa nova with a Japanese female singer on their 2007 debut.<p><p>Their third disc, Kallio, released in early 2013, splices in Ethiopian and Balkan sounds, ska, surf guitar, rockabilly and Pink Panther-style lounge. It entered the Finnish chart at number 13, with the single “Ilta Tokoinrannassa” becoming a local radio hit.<p><p>“Kallio is definitely an evolution in the sound of Dalindèo,” says Pöyhönen, who switches off between guitar, keyboards and electronics. He has lived in many European cities, and conceived Kallio as a soundtrack to his bohemian Helsinki neighbourhood of the same name.<p><p>By Wif Stenger, June 2013<p><p>Hip-hop meets bebop<p><p>Bossa to Balkan<p>", "time": "2014-06-24T13:07:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Screenwriter Kirsikka Saari tells us what it takes to create world-class film.<p><p>The only other Finnish film to get an Oscar nomination was Aki Kaurismäki’s Man without a Past (Mies vailla menneisyyttä), in 2002. Do I have to take care of everything? (Pitääkö mun kaikki hoitaa?), nominated in the category of Short Film Live Action, tells the story of one family’s chaotic morning and a mother determined to do everything it takes to get her family out the door on time.<p><p>The idea for the story came from screenwriter Kirsikka Saari’s own life. “When you have your own company and you’re working and trying to take care of your kids at the same time, it can sometimes be a struggle,” she explains.<p><p>Screenwriter Kirsikka Saari got the idea for her Oscar-nominated film one day when she lost her temper and snapped at her family.Photo: Tuffi Films<p><p>“I’d been thinking about the idea of a busy family morning for a while, but the final idea only crystallised this one time when I snapped at my family and decided to go outside to cool down.<p><p>“While I was out, I started laughing at myself. Like me, many women often try to take care of everything by themselves but can also laugh at themselves. This is what I wanted to communicate with this film – that sometimes when you’re in a hurry you can forget what’s really important in family life.” Saari sees it as the story of a Finnish woman first and foremost, but believes “people identify with the characters in the film, and that makes it funny” to international audiences, too.<p><p>When the film was first released in March 2012, it didn’t seem to take off. “We sent it to a lot of festivals, but we didn’t think it was going to be a hit until Aspen. After that, things started happening and it attracted more interest,” Saari recalls. Do I have to take care of everything? won the Best Comedy and Audience Recognition awards at Aspen Shortfest 2013, which qualified the film for the Academy Awards application and led to the Oscar nomination.<p><p>You can’t do everything – or can you?

In 2010, the four of them founded Tuffi, a company that is one-of-a-kind in the Finnish film industry. Unlike most other production companies, Tuffi Films employs screenwriters and directors in addition to producers, so it can produce films in-house from start to finish.<p><p>“Film productions are often long and there’s always the danger of someone walking out in the middle of the process,” says Saari. “We started the company because we all wanted to work as part of a well-functioning, fun team and really commit to the work. True commitment makes the work feel more important and increases our chances of succeeding.”<p><p>During its relatively short history, Tuffi Films has already collected honours such as the Short Film Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013, for The Date. Korso, a fiction film about a teenager who lives in the Helsinki suburb of Korso and dreams about becoming a streetball star in New York, was released in February 2014. Tuffi also has several other fiction and documentary films in production.<p><p>“We’ve worked hard for years and now we’ve met with success,” says Saari. “Receiving international recognition is invaluable to us.

{"title": "Finland’s national instrument gets louder - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finlands-national-instrument-gets-louder/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The Finnish national instrument, the kantele, has a tranquil, serene reputation. That’s changing as the kantele becomes louder, more versatile – and even a bit angry (yes, like Angry Birds). In addition, find out about its close connections to Kalevala Day, also called Finnish Culture Day, celebrated annually on February 28.<p><p>“There’s this National Romantic image from the beginning of the 20th century of a girl with long blond hair and a traditional costume playing a kantele under a birch tree or whatever,” says Jutta Rahmel, a 20-something, purple-haired urbanite who plays in the kantele quartet Kardemimmit. “So nowadays people think of the kantele as girlish, which I think is a shame.”<p><p>Jutta Rahmel and her group Kardemimmit represent a new generation of kantele players who are exploring the possibilities of the instrument.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>The kantele plays a central role in Finnish culture. Kalevala, Finland’s national epic poem, first published in 1835, has a kantele-plucking hero. An 1840 companion volume contains similar verses and bears the title Kanteletar (the term for a female kantele player).<p><p>Resembling the zither, the instrument has been played in Finland for some 2,000 years, and variations exist in other eastern Baltic countries. The most basic version has five strings but there are up to 39 on large concert models such as that played by Rahmel. She encountered the instrument in the standard way – at music playschool when she was four years old.<p><p>“It’s a good introduction to music,” she says. “It’s a nice, easy way to start.” That’s why the kantele has been a key element of Finland’s celebrated music education system since the 1970s.<p><p>“Back then nobody was playing the kantele, but musician and composer Martti Pokela saved the instrument,” says Rahmel. “He encouraged every school to get at least one small, basic kantele.”<p><p>Bright and angry for export<p><p>This kantele for kids combines an ancient instrument and a modern tech success.Photo: Koistinen<p><p>The instrument’s educational role is now being tested as an export product via the Angry Birds Playground learning concept.<p><p>The programme, based on the Finnish National Curriculum for Kindergarten, was launched with by gaming giant Rovio and the University of Helsinki in late 2013 and is being rolled out in China. Finland’s biggest kantele company, Koistinen, has created a bold, playful-looking instrument for the programme.<p><p>“Rovio didn’t have a music section for the Rovio Playground concept,” explains electric kantele player Anttu Koistinen, 21. “In the summer of 2012, they invited us to come in and introduce our kanteles and pedagogical products, and they got really excited. We did multiple school and kindergarten trials, and kids loved it – including the boys.”<p><p>Anttu is acting as Koistinen’s project manager for the Rovio programme. His grandfather started the kantele company in eastern Finland in 1957, and his aunt Ritva Koistinen works as a leading kantele educator and performer.<p><p>The concept of the kantele has expanded in recent years and now includes bigger, flashier instruments.Photo: Koistinen<p><p>Anttu’s father, Hannu Koistinen, a second-generation kantele builder and an avid electric guitarist, began redesigning the kantele in 1989. He shocked the purists.<p><p>“At that time the kantele was invisible,” he says at the firm’s small Helsinki showroom. “It was very quiet and impossible to amplify well because of the very unequal sound of strings. So it wasn’t really working for the rising young musicians. Something had to be done.”<p><p>Hannu first developed acoustic concert kanteles to a professional level, then turned his attention to adding electricity. Taking a cue from electric guitars, he introduced brightly coloured, amplified kanteles that can be played standing up rather than in the classical seated position.<p><p>“It’s essential for musicians to have a closer connection with audience,” he says. “That’s natural, as kantele is rarely played in smoky huts nowadays,” he adds, referring to the rural settings where people used the instrument in previous centuries.<p><p>Instead, kanteles are appearing in rock clubs, pop videos and music festivals around the globe. That’s largely thanks to supergroup Värttinä, who hail from Rääkkylä, the same eastern Finnish town as Koistinen. It also hosts the annual Kihaus Folk Festival in early July. This area near the Russian border is a kantele hotbed, and source of most of the Kalevala verses.<p><p>Koistinen close-up: The kantele strings are wrapped around metal tuning pegs.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>“North Karelia has Finland’s oldest, most original kantele tradition, so I think it’s natural that the modernising is also taking place there,” says Hannu.<p><p>“My father, who’s still working at age 88, has always had a strong connection with Karelia’s nature. He gets ideas from dreams and intuition, and places like Koli [a national park], one of the greatest landscapes in Finland. You feel some kind of holy connection with the past there.”<p><p>Echoing that mystical connection, the traditional kantele sound is delicate, harp-like and celestial. The electric models, though, can hold their own in the hard-driving music of Finnish rapper Asa and heavy metal band Tevana3.<p><p>“I like the acoustic sound – even when you amplify it, it still sounds natural, just bigger,” says Rahmel. “But I’m also really interested in electrifying it with pedals and effects. That’s the next thing I really want to do.”<p><p>By Wif Stenger, February 2014<p><p>Shocking the kantele purists<p><p>Echoing mystical connections<p>", "time": "2014-03-03T07:34:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Your top 10 Finnish films, and a director - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/your-top-10-finnish-films-and-a-director/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Here come our readers’ top 10 selections of noteworthy Finnish films, gathered from a survey on page. Break out the popcorn!<p><p>As movies go, Finland offers many treats, from award-winning documentaries to the entire oeuvre of Academy Award nominee Aki Kaurismäki. Finns and non-Finns alike fall in love with this stuff – before you know it, you’ll be recommending these comedies, dramas and action flicks to everyone you know. Here we go (the voting was so close that we’ve left them unnumbered):<p><p>Photo: SF Film Finland<p><p>This movie pulls off the challenging task of taking a familiar, traditional character – good old Santa Claus – and rewriting him in an action context, showing a darker side to his myth. In a daring fantasy film set in Lapland around Christmas time, Santa is discovered and captured. Children start disappearing and Lapland faces a band of rebellious elves trying to free their leader. Helander displays a deft touch in combining action and humour. The dark and frozen winter of the Finnish Lapland becomes one of the movie’s main characters.[Editor’s note: Not a film for kids!]<p><p><p><p>Another movie set in Finnish Lapland presents action-tinged comedy with a sunnier outlook than Rare Exports, but in a setting that is just as dark. The shenanigans kick off when Janne, a career slacker, is given the task of buying a digital TV receiver by his girlfriend Inari. Snowy hijinks ensue. Janne and his friends face a comedy of errors ranging from the limited opening hours of electronics stores in Rovaniemi to the arrival of heavily armed Russian tourists. Lapland Odyssey is a gem.<p><p><p><p>Around 70,000 Finnish children were evacuated to Sweden during the Second World War. Härö’s movie examines this period through the eyes of a nine-year-old boy, Eero. The themes explored include trust, love and the difficulty of doing the right thing. Eero’s mother is undependable, and her choices make it hard for Eero to trust in maternal love. Sixty years later, he reads the letters of his Swedish foster mother after her funeral and finds a measure of peace. The film won a number of international awards, including the 2006 Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.<p><p>In Finland, known for its production of world-class documentary films, The Punk Syndrome stands out. So does its subject: a punk rock band consisting of four men with mental disabilities makes its mark in the music scene. The fact is that the band kicks ass. In addition to highlighting a great punk band, the documentary can be seen as an exploration of how similar we all are, even when society puts us in our individual little boxes. Like all great documentaries, this one gets really close to its subjects. It won the SXGlobal Award at SXSW in Austin, Texas.<p><p><p><p>“Sauna” is the only word that has migrated from Finnish into English. In Finland saunas are used for socialising as well as bathing, and this film takes us into the country’s heart and soul. On screen, Finnish men bathe in various saunas and speak with great candour about what’s on their minds. Steam of Life forms a touching comment on humanity and masculinity, dealing with universal truths as it covers issues related to regret, life, love, empty-nest syndrome and what it’s like when your best friend is a bear. It’s difficult to avoid becoming teary-eyed at some point during the film.<p><p>Two versions based on the same classic of Finnish literature, made 30 years apart, are both great movies and illustrate changing attitudes towards war and patriotism. Laine takes the originally controversial, but later beloved book by Väinö Linna and turns it into a tribute to the soul and resourcefulness of Finland’s soldiers during the Second World War. Mollberg’s version concentrates on the horrors and impact of war. The latter director went to great lengths to keep his actors on edge by denying them most normal comforts and changing the layouts of the sets without warning. The movies tell the story of a ragtag machine gun company called to the eastern Finnish front in 1941.<p><p><p><p>The devastation wrought by the Second Chechen War and its impact on both Chechen and Russian children are at the heart of this poetic documentary. The camera explores a Russian military school, a war-torn village and children in a refugee camp. Honkasalo lets the images speak for themselves and utilises sparse narration, telling a tragic story in a touching manner, while avoiding passing judgment. The film won three awards at the Venice Film Festival and Golden Apricot/Grand Prize for best documentary at the Yerevan International Film Festival, to list a few.<p><p>Photo: Malla Hukkanen/Making Movies Ltd<p><p>Kotwica’s film is a thriller, a psychological drama and a black comedy. Saara is a doctor whose architect husband, Leo, is having an affair with a younger woman, Tuuli. To get revenge, Saara befriends Tuuli without revealing her own identity. Eicca Toppinen of the band Apocalyptica wrote a suitably tense score for this labyrinthine movie. Kotwica received a nomination for Best Director at the Berlin International Film Festival and the movie was remade in South Korea under the title Love, In Between.<p><p>Photo: Solar Films<p><p>This complex movie involves a number of interwoven stories propelled into motion by a schoolteacher getting fired from his job. As a filmmaker, Louhimies tends to look at his fellow human beings and their foibles with an unblinking eye, but for all their weakness and tribulations, people tend to be resilient. At times they are even good. Frozen Land won awards at festivals in Athens, Bergen, Gothenburg, Leeds and Moscow.<p><p>Photo: Nordisk Film<p><p>In this film based on a children’s book series by Sinikka and Tiina Nopola, Ricky is a drummer and a rapper, and has a habit of getting into all kinds of jams, musical and otherwise. An independent and resourceful child, he finds himself at odds with the sometimes dopey adults of his world, some of whom just can’t abide his passion for funky beats. But fundamentally he’s on the side of all that is good in the world. A musical and a family film that everyone can enjoy, Ricky Rapper was one of Finland’s biggest box office successes the year it was released.<p><p>Photo: Toivo Särkkä, ©KAVI/Suomen Filmiteollisuus<p><p>Also known as Out to Borrow Matches, this Finnish-Soviet collaboration is based on a 1910 novel is a comedy set in the town of Liperi in eastern Finland and includes Russian and Finnish actors. The story begins with a simple trip by Antti Ihalainen to the neighbour to borrow matches, but takes a turn when Ihalainen runs into his friend Jussi Vatanen, who gives him a ride. Vatanen, who has been a widower for a year at this point, needs Ihalainen’s help in finding a new prospective wife. Events soon spiral out of control in this accomplished example of bucolic slapstick comedy. Another, all-Finnish version also exists, directed in 1938 by Yrjö Norta and Toivo Särkkä.<p><p><p><p>Kaurismäki is one of those rare directors whose style is so characteristic and unique that it merits its own adjective. “Kaurismäki-esque” is used to describe everything from American indie films to Helsinki restaurants. He has produced masterpieces of European cinema during every phase of his 30-year career, most recently Le Havre (2011) and The Man without a Past (2002). The latter won the Grand Prix and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at Cannes, and was the only Finnish Film ever nominated for an Academy Award. Kaurismäki’s works emphasise his empathy for the downtrodden and disenfranchised. He possesses the ability to make you laugh at surprising things.<p><p>By Arttu Tolonen, January 2014<p><p>Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale Directed by Jalmari Helander (original title: Rare Exports), 2010<p><p>Lapland Odyssey Dir.

Their newest recording, Sibelius’s Symphonies nos. 1 and 4, won a Grammy in January 2014.<p><p>[Editor’s update: Six months after this article first appeared, a dispute began between the Minnesota Orchestra’s musicians and its management, leading to a lock-out. Vänskä chose to resign from his post as musical director in October 2013 after the parties reached a standstill. The labour dispute was resolved in January 2014, less than two weeks before the Grammys, but not before planned recording projects and concert tours had been put on hold.<p><p>Vänskä has reportedly indicated that he might return to Minnesota if invited. Read on to hear about the magic touch that he brings to orchestras under his direction – and that helped the Minnesota Orchestra’s Sibelius win the Grammy.]<p><p>Two days before a performance in downtown Minneapolis, the Minnesota Orchestra is preparing to begin rehearsal. The violins are practicing their runs for Symphony no. 4 by the famous Jean Sibelius, Finland’s most renowned composer. A percussionist is fine-tuning the timpani, his ear to the drum head.<p><p>When Osmo Vänskä steps to the podium, the hall instantly falls silent.<p><p>The musicians are expecting a demanding afternoon – Vänska is especially picky with Sibelius, and will stop a rehearsal for as long as it takes to fix the tiniest of flaws. With close attention to detail and an unmatched knowledge of the scores, the Finnish conductor has distinguished the Minnesota Orchestra as one of America’s best.<p><p>Since he took over as music director in 2003, the group has vastly increased its average audience size and earned international praise and a Grammy nomination for its recordings of Beethoven’s symphonies. A recently completed fundraising drive raked in an unprecedented 100 million dollars.<p><p>“I don’t know how my musical taste or my musical heart or my musical brain is built,” Vänskä says, “but obviously some composers speak to me a little bit more than others.” He’s referring to his affinity for the works of Ludwig van Beethoven and Jean Sibelius.<p><p>“My job is to put things together,” says Minnesota Orchestra music director Osmo Vänskä.Photo: Todd Buchanan<p><p>In true Finnish fashion, Vänskä is direct. He knows what he wants from the orchestra – and he won’t waste time catering to musicians’ egos.<p><p>“I’m not their therapist,” Vänskä says. “I don’t need to think about how their mind is offended or pleased. My job is to put things together.”<p><p>And put things together he has, leading the orchestra into a golden era. The Times of London called the ensemble “a new superstar band,” and in 2006 the New York Times dubbed it the most important orchestra in America.<p><p>“He’s extraordinarily demanding,” says Richard Marshall, the orchestra’s co-principal violist. “And by that I mean he’ll sit there and work on a phrase forever and ever, even if there is a lot of the music and repertoire left that needs to be rehearsed.”<p><p>Vänskä says his goal is to get musicians to unlearn what they know about music they’ve played thousands of times. Many musicians have adapted their own style over myriad performances with previous orchestras or other conductors.<p><p>The goal, Vänskä says, is to play exactly what the composer intended, and he has toiled to understand what Sibelius intended. With permission from Sibelius’s descendants, Vänskä gained exclusive access to early versions and unfinished and unpublished scores, and used them to present a final product that many say is at the same time cleaner and rawer than under any other conductor.<p><p>“It’s the best Sibelius that I’ve ever done,” Marshall says.<p><p>The orchestra’s plans originally included recording the complete symphonies of Sibelius in advance of the composer’s 150th birthday in 2015.<p><p>“Some composers speak to me a little bit more than others,” says Osmo Vänskä.Photo: Robert Downs<p><p>When Vänskä moved to Minneapolis in 2003, he immediately displayed his Finnish roots by installing a sauna in his downtown apartment. “I don’t want to live without sauna,” he says. “It’s good for my soul.”<p><p>He found the transition from Finland to Minnesota quite easy: “Minnesota is very much like Finland or Sweden. A lot of forests, a lot of lakes, four seasons, and there are a lot of areas where we don’t see buildings and it’s the real nature. I think those things are very much connected to the Nordic countries.”<p><p>Vänska spent more than 20 years with the Lahti Symphony Orchestra in southern Finland, transforming it from a mid-level group to a world-renowned ensemble famous for its recordings of Sibelius. That success led to jobs as conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and later the Minnesota Orchestra.<p><p>He’s quick to dismiss the immediate Finnish connection people make between him and Sibelius: “It’s not a national thing, because what do we say about Beethoven, if that’s the case?”<p><p>By Robert Downs, April 2012, updated January 2014<p><p>Demanding excellence<p><p>Minnesota sauna for the soul<p>", "time": "2014-01-31T08:56:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Finnish design is practical, and it’s not elitist – it’s for everyone.<p><p>One of the most cited anecdotes about Marimekko, a mainstay of Finnish design, is the story of how its massively popular Unikko (“poppy”) print was born: In the early 1960s, Marimekko founder and visionary Armi Ratia announced that the textile and clothing design house – in an effort to be bold and modern – would not do floral prints, because flowers were so much more beautiful in real life. In protest, legendary designer Maija Isola created the peppy poppy pattern. It went on to become one of the world’s most iconic prints.<p><p>Unikko, which appears on everything from umbrellas to dresses to dishware, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014. It continues to enjoy a strong presence along with other daily design essentials.<p><p>Ceramic kitchenware by Arabia (actually from Finland despite the brand name) makes setting the table a colourful job.Photo: Arabia<p><p>At the Mikkonen-Young household in Helsinki, a range of Finnish design items is visible, including an Artek kitchen table, Arabia plates, Iittala drinking glasses, Fiskars scissors and knives, Muurame children’s furniture and Iittala Kivi votives.<p><p>And of course a set of well-loved, blue Unikko patterned sheets.<p><p>“The pattern is so quintessentially Finnish for me – the flowers, the vivid colours – that I almost have a smile on my face when I pull them out of the cupboard,” says Brett Young, a Canadian Finn who grew up in Toronto. He and his wife, Leena Mikkonen-Young, have two primary-school-age girls.<p><p>Young says that the family has chosen their design items for a variety of reasons:<p><p>“First off, they are extremely well made and have lasted us many years. For example, the Muurame bed was first used by our eldest, and now her younger sister is using it. Then there is the style and design – the Kivi candleholders are great for dark winter nights, and the Artek table is a classic that Leena has known since she was a child.”<p><p>“These characteristics have combined to give us strong faith in the brands, and in Finnish brands in general,” says Young, who first encountered Nordic design in his former hometown. “There was a place in Toronto called The Finnish Shop, where I saw some great kitchenware design by companies that had the most amazing names: Iittala? Two i’s to start a name? This fed my interest in Finland, which was already growing.”<p><p>Can you spot the Fiskars scissors and knife, the Iittala glasses and the Arabia cups and bowls on this kitchen counter?Photo: Arabia<p><p>When Young arrived in Finland in 1998, he was already familiar with brands such as Marimekko and Nokia. In fact, after a four-year stint as the Helsinki bureau chief for international news agency Reuters, he went on to work for Nokia in corporate communications.<p><p>“My first mobile phone was a Nokia (the 6110), and I remember that when covering the Finnish EU presidency in 1999, journalists got a nifty Marimekko bag,” he says. “As a business journalist, the story behind Marimekko’s rise, fall and rise was also fascinating.” He’s referring to the company’s ups and downs over the years. These have included near-bankruptcy in the early 1990s and a remarkable recovery leading to its current international expansion, with 108 stores around the world.<p><p>With Marimekko, and with Finnish design in general, one of the most enduring elements remains a sense of democracy. Annamari Vänskä, a University of Stockholm researcher and adjunct professor who specialises in visual culture, fashion and visual art, recently summed up Finnish design neatly in the main Finnish daily newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat:<p><p>“Finns are used to having well-designed mugs, cutlery, plates and furniture. It’s almost standard; nowhere else in the world is design such a part of daily life and something that’s for everyone – not just for the elite, as design is in many parts of the world.”<p><p> <p><p>By Katja Pantzar, January 2014<p><p>Quintessentially Finnish<p><p>Design democracy<p>", "time": "2014-02-10T09:10:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

We are well acquainted with the design pedigrees of our kitchen cupboards, stocked with Arabia tableware and Iittala glassware that we use on a daily basis. Alvar Aalto’s Savoy vase is often placed on the table for special occasions.<p><p>Bold patterns and organic fabric designs by Marimekko. Marimekko introduces dozens of new fabric designs each year, and designers are not given any limitations beforehand. Instead, they are free to create and inject their own experiences and views of trends into the patterns.Photo: Marimekko<p><p>Our surroundings are filled with design, from architecture and city planning to public transportation vehicles and sign systems. We decorate our homes with Marimekko textiles and Artek furniture; we wear designer clothes by IvanaHelsinki, Ril’s or Tiia Vanhatapio or leisurewear by Halti or Rukka. In Finland, design is ever-present, yet we typically notice it only when it’s lacking, making everyday life inconvenient.<p><p>We’re a true design nation, with a long history and a strong heritage in design. Finnish design has been promoted internationally since 1875, and the success of the Finnish design icons of the 1950s and ’60s has been passed on to innovative and eager generations of younger designers who work with internationally famous brands.<p><p>Recognition of the importance of design for Finland is both institutional and international: Helsinki School of Economics, Helsinki University of Technology and the University of Art and Design Helsinki merged into Aalto University, a new innovative force, in 2010. And in 2012, the Finnish capital was also World Design Capital. New ideas are emerging in the field, expanding towards marketing, communications, service, digital design and social media.<p><p>Design is a high-quality cultural export and represents an increasingly important competitive factor for Finnish products and companies that want to stand out internationally. Purity and authenticity in materials and products are the expectations at home and abroad, and form a good starting point for the future of Finnish design and industry. Come visit our cool northern land – and experience our warm passion for design. (AK)<p><p>In 2012, Helsinki was the World Design Capital. Helsinki‘s co-hosts were the cities of Espoo, Kauniainen, Vantaa and Lahti. The World Design Capital designation is awarded biennially to a city which commendably uses design as a resource for its social, financial and cultural development. The appointment is made by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (Icsid). Helsinki formed the third World Design Capital, succeeding Turin, Italy (2008) and Seoul, South Korea (2010).<p><p>The programme in 2012 consisted of some 300 projects, half of which are long-term development projects aiming to improve the conditions of cities for city-dwellers. “Embedding design in life” refers to expanding the realm of design from products to various systems and public services such as health care. Embedded design also emphasises paying attention to the needs of users from the very first stages of planning and design.<p><p>The programme involved a wide range of participants from ministries to universities, and from private companies to public museums. It increased the demand for Finnish design both in Finland and internationally, and improved the living environment for the residents of the cities involved.<p><p>Helsinki Design District forms a hub of creativity in the heart of Helsinki: just over one square kilometre with more than 180 design shops, galleries, workshops and trendy bars and restaurants, not to mention design hotels. Featured on a special Helsinki Design District map, this area also includes the Design Museum, the Museum of Finnish Architecture and Design Forum Finland.<p><p>Every autumn, Helsinki Design Week directs attention to the creative industries, spreads new ideas and provokes discussion. Every spring, the Masters of Arts event organised by the University of Art and Design Helsinki showcases the merits of recent graduates. The Night of the Arts in late August brings the whole city out for performing arts, exhibitions, free concerts and more. (AV)<p><p> <p><p>Design embedded in people’s lives is the overriding theme of Helsinki’s World Design Capital 2012 year and events.

It arranges exhibitions, creates publications, runs the Design Forum Shop, distributes information and awards prizes. Design Forum Finland is maintained by the Finnish Society of Crafts and Design, which was founded in 1875 and forms the second-oldest design organisation in the world.<p><p>The Design Museum, previously the Museum of Art and Design, records the history of design, maintains a collection of objects and arranges a variety of exhibitions, some of which also tour internationally. The roots of the museum also reach back to the 1800s: the first objects for the collection were purchased in 1873. Today, it comprises 35,000 objects, 40,000 drawings and 100,000 images. The Arabia Museum in Helsinki, which focuses on ceramics, and the glass museums in Iittala and Nuutajärvi are also part of the Design Museum.<p><p>The Finnish Glass Museum, located 50 kilometres north of Helsinki in Riihimäki is a national specialist museum focusing on glass design and the history of the medium. Other museums that document Finnish handicrafts and applied art include the Craft Museum of Finland in Jyväskylä, 270 kilometres north of the capital, and the Alvar Aalto Museum, also in Jyväskylä. The famous architect and designer’s studio and house are located in Helsinki. Fiskars Village, a centre of art and design 100 kilometres west of Helsinki, also arranges exhibitions and events.<p><p>Finland boasts a large number of design-related educational institutions. The University of Art and Design Helsinki, established in 1871, is among the best design schools in Europe and one of the most respected in the world. Today, it is part of the new Aalto University. The University of Lapland’s Faculty of Art and Design forms the centre of design education in northern Finland. Among polytechnic-level schools, the best known is the Institute of Design in Lahti, 100 kilometres north of Helsinki.<p><p>The interests of Finnish designers are promoted by the Finnish Association of Designers Ornamo, established in 1911. About 2,400 design professionals belong to the organisation, including industrial and interior designers, craft and textile artists and fashion designers. Graphic designers have their own association, Grafia, established in 1933.

Kähönen is known for his versatility, ranging from strategic design to corporate identity and product design. He was awarded the Kaj Franck Design Prize by Design Forum Finland in 2009.<p><p>Kähönen’s works include Abloy locks and keys, Exel sports poles and Helsinki’s low-floor trams and buses. Kähönen likes to apply the design-for-all approach, which integrates accessibility and environmental considerations into the design process. How can we guarantee that seniors can live at home as long as possible? What kind of equipment is needed in home nursing services? High-quality design contributes to user safety and wellbeing.<p><p>For quite some time, Kähönen’s Creadesign has focused on design-oriented product concepts: future brands available for the industry to license. Key considerations include usability, collapsibility and recycling. One of Kähönen’s innovations is the 2F folding chair, made of birch plywood. It unfolds in both directions, with a different colour on each side. When folded, the chair is only 25 millimetres thick, and a hundred chairs only take one cubic metre of storage space.<p><p>Another innovation is the Klapi bridge, which can be bought by the metre and assembled on-site without special tools. Its construction is based on identical parts that can be assembled to the desired width or length. A Klapi bridge can made of stone, wood or plastic. This is truly environmentally sustainable design, which conserves materials by utilising recycled or locally available materials. (AK)<p><p>Alvar Aalto’s Aalto Vase, also known as the Savoy Vase, is a world-famous piece of glassware and an iconic work of Finnish design. The vase was designed as an entry in a design competition for the Karhula-Iittala glassworks factory in 1936 and will celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2011. (It became known as the Savoy vase because it was included in a design collection created by Alvar Aalto and Aino for the Savoy restaurant, which opened in 1937 in Helsinki.Photo: Iittala/Arabia imagebank<p><p>Finnish fashion is known for quality and originality. Functionality and attention to Nordic weather conditions goes without saying, but Finnish designers also like to experiment, creating bold fashion beyond seasonal trends.<p><p>Finnish fashion is undergoing a fascinating transformation. During the past few years, a number of new designers have launched interesting collections, while established names – Vuokko Nurmesniemi, Jukka Rintala, Ritva-Liisa Pohjalainen and Ritva Falla, among others – continue to have a strong presence.<p><p>What contemporary Finnish fashion designers have in common is that their creations are not for the mainstream masses. Instead, they are designed for individuals with a strong sense of style, whether the focus is on environmental sustainability, street fashion or classic chic.<p><p>IVANAhelsinki emphasises ethical choices and manufactures its clothes in Finland. From left: Nelly, Paige and Reese show off items from the 2010 collection.© IVANAhelsinki<p><p>Recycling forms a megatrend the moment; Globe Hope is a pioneering company on this front. Vintage treasures also serve as an inspiration for many designers and small brands. Designers favouring classicism include Anna Ruohonen, based in Paris; sisters Päivi and Anna Haaksiluoto; Naoto Niidome, with his exclusive collection; and Anssi Tuupainen, who focuses on men’s fashion. Distinctive, idiosyncratic styles have been created by siblings Tuomas and Anna Laitinen; the Rinne Niinikoski duo; street fashion wizard Daniel Palillo; Hanna Sarén; Tiia Vanhatapio; Paola Suhonen’s IVANA Helsinki; and Mika Piirainen of Marimekko.<p><p>A number of designers focus on shoes and accessories. Janne Lax values the tradition of handicraft in his St Vacant shoes. Based in London, Julia Lundsten is an internationally recognised shoe designer who received the Young Designer of the Year Award from Design Forum Finland in 2007. Minna Parikka is famous for her shoes and bags radiating 1950s glamour. Sanna Kantola and Bruno Beaugrand design bags and accessories for their Lumi Accessories; Virva Launo revamped the bag collection of Marimekko. Ville Lehtinen creates hand-crocheted headgear and bags for his Outo Wear.

The hand-crafted clothes and accessories are manufactured in Finland as atelier pieces out of natural materials. IVANAhelsinki was also the first in a new wave of Finnish fashion brands to be seen on the catwalks of Paris fashion week, in 2007. In 2011, the label became the first Finnish fashion house ever to participate with its own runway show in New York’s Mercedes Benz Fashion Week. Original, powerful and graphic visual and photographic expression has been Paola Suhonen’s trademark as a designer. (AK)<p><p>The impossible made real: Harri Koskinen’s prize-winning Block Lamp, resembling a light inside an ice cube, became an instant design classic upon its release in 1996. New York’s Museum of Modern Art added the piece to its collection in 2000.Photo: Iittala/Arabia imagebank<p><p>Finnish applied art is rooted in a strong vernacular tradition and culture of objects. The active role taken by the Finnish Society of Crafts and Design (founded in 1875) has provided a basis for education and international activities at World’s Fairs and major competitions.<p><p>Well-known examples include World’s Fairs during the 1930s, which made Alvar Aalto a household name in the international media; and the triumphs at the Milan Triennale in the 1950s and 1960s, which made national icons out of such designers as Tapio Wirkkala, Timo Sarpaneva, Antti Nurmesniemi and Nanny Still. Glass design has gained particular international acclaim; today, the tradition is cherished by such companies as Iittala.<p><p>Times and needs have changed in 50 years, but remembering this unique history makes it easier to understand why the Finns still have such a close relationship with design. In the greater Helsinki area alone there are approximately 10,000 design professionals, and the number of design-intensive companies is 110,000 to 200,000, depending on the definition.<p><p>Industrial design plays an inconspicuous but omnipresent role in our daily lives. Someone has designed the mobile phones and lifts we use and the public transport signs we see. The challenges faced by designers in the future will not only be related to sustainable development but also to service design.<p><p>Leading industrial design trendsetters in Finland include Nokia, Kone, Metso, Fiskars, Iittala, Rocla, Suunto and Vaisala. Companies increasingly integrate design into their operations, something which is recognised through the most important design competition in Finland, the biennial Fennia Prize. There are active industrial design agencies, such as Creadesign, ED-Design, Linja-design and Muotohiomo, and active in-house teams, such as the staff at Palodex, Rocla and Suunto.<p><p>Prizes and awards help make industrial designers better known – otherwise they tend to remain anonymous. Examples include Hannu Kähönen, art professor and winner of the 2009 Kaj Franck Design Award; and Arni Aromaa and Sauli Suomela from Pentagon Design, who are the 2010 Industrial Designers of the Year selected by the Finnish Association of Designers Ornamo.<p><p>Crafts and applied art also possess a respected heritage in Finland. Artistic experimentation is often an important phase preceding industrial innovation and serial production. Finnish ceramics and glass art have a strong contemporary presence. Ceramists include Kirsi Kivivirta, Nathalie Lahdenmäki, Heini Riitahuhta and Kim Simonsson, while glass designers include Anu Penttinen, Harri Koskinen, Markku Salo and Oiva Toikka.<p><p>A dynamic group of ceramists works as part of the Arabia Art Department Society, and the legendary glass-blowing villages of Nuutajärvi (1793) and Iittala (1881) still produce both hand-blown items and glassware for daily use. In addition, there are numerous small design workshops all around Finland, all the way to northernmost Lapland.<p><p>Adherence to local tradition and dedication to materials is typical of craft professionals, such as those in Ornamo and the Finnish Association of Artists and Designers, TAIKO. Young designers in particular have sought bold new dimensions while preserving tradition; examples include MIE, a group of textile artists based in Rovaniemi, and designer groups such as Anteeksi and Design Migration. Strongly rooted in their own culture, Finnish designers of all ages actively seek new influences and frequently participate in international arenas such as the design weeks in Tokyo and New York. (AK)<p><p>Harri Koskinen, industrial designer and founder of Friends of Industry Ltd, is known for the streamlined products he has designed for global brands such as Issey Miyake, Magis, Montina, Venini, Oluce and Design House Stockholm. One of his earliest products, the Block lamp (1996), is included in the MoMA collection in New York. The Muu chair for Montina earned Koskinen the Italian 2004 Compasso D’Oro award, while a subwoofer Koskinen designed for Genelec won the 2009 Fennia Prize Grand Prix, Finland’s biggest design award. In November 2009, Koskinen received the world’s largest design prize, the Torsten and Wanja Söderberg Award, worth one million Swedish crowns, for his achievements in design.<p><p>Harri KoskinenPhoto: Iittala/Arabia imagebank<p><p>Who is the man, the designer behind all of these accomplishments? Harri Koskinen’s roots lie deep in the central Finnish countryside, in a place called Karstula. As a student at the Lahti Institute of Design, he won his first design competition and began working as a summer intern in 1996 in the village of Nuutajärvi, known for its glassworks. This marked the beginning of his cooperation with the Finnish company Iittala. His latest collection of blown glass pieces, Artworks, was presented at London 100% Design in September and at Tokyo Design Week 2009. But glass is just the tip of the iceberg. Productive and versatile, Koskinen also challenges himself with plastic, steel and textiles, such as his prize-winning prints for Marimekko, which are also produced as wallpaper. Koskinen’s signature is unique, functional and often minimalist design – everyday aesthetics at their best, always including a touch of timeless elegance. (AK)<p><p>Janine Rewell is one of the many exciting young Finnish graphic designers from the illustration agency Agent Pekka. Created for Atria, the design is called “A feel-good pattern”.Photo: Agent Pekka<p><p>Finland is experiencing a boom in graphic design. Illustration, typeface design, digital environments and corporate identities are strong areas. Graphic design is easy to promote on the internet: websites and blogs allow agencies to reach worldwide audiences. Many Finnish graphic designers are based abroad.<p><p>The Finnish style, which often combines both Eastern and Western cultural heritage, has made a breakthrough. Rich in fantasy and decorative detail, the illustrations of Klaus Haapaniemi have gained wide international acclaim; the same goes for Sanna Annukka, which hark back to the Finnish epic Kalevala and Finnish folklore. Kustaa Saksi, based in Amsterdam, and Pietari Posti, based in Barcelona, are both masters of strong line and bold colour. Sami Kortemäki is known as one of the founders of typeface design specialists Underware. Illustration agency Agent Pekka boasts many of the hot names of Finnish graphic design.<p><p>High-quality commercial art names include Dog Design and Hahmo Design, which focuses on corporate identities. Tango Helsinki ranges from packaging design to brand identity and strategic design. Teemu Suviala’s and Antti Hinkula’s Kokoro&amp;Moi attracts clients from both Finland and overseas. (AV)<p><p>Alan Wake is a psychological thriller action-adventure video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for Xbox 360.<p><p>The history of the Finnish gaming industry is brief but impressive. The first Finnish gaming companies sprung up during the 1990s, and the majority of existing companies weren’t founded until after 2000. At this moment, there are currently more than 50 companies in Finland actively involved in game development; industry turnover for 2008 was approximately 87 million euros.<p><p>Talented designers in the field are continuously generating unique innovations. Past international breakthroughs range from action games such as Remedy Enterprise’s Max Payne series to interactive gaming such as Habbo Hotel from Sulake. Finns are also known worldwide for their expertise in 3D graphics.<p><p>Habbo Hotel by Sulake Corporation is the world’s largest virtual community for teenagers. Localised Habbo communities all around the world are visited by millions of teenagers every week.© Habbo Hotel<p><p>Finland is also home to Nokia, of course, and mobile games make up almost as much of the total gaming industry production as PC and console games. Online games have a smaller market share but are coming on strong. Most importantly, the gaming industry and its various sub-fields are an important segment of Finland’s growing service design sector.<p><p>For instance, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation Tekes supports the product development activities of innovative companies, including those in the gaming industry, while Neogames organises training, research, international networking and communications.

It was the sensation of the fair, the international breakthrough for Eero Aarnio and the start of a whole line of fibreglass designs by Aarnio. The more recent versions include additional features such as music and MP3 player integration.Photo: Design Eero Aarnio<p><p>Furniture is one of Finnish design’s strongest sectors: Eero Aarnio’s Ball and Pastil chairs and Alvar Aalto’s three-legged stool and Paimio chair form icons that have represented Finland internationally. The strengths of Finnish design are clearly visible in furniture design: knowledge of material, functionalism and a clear formal language. Aalto’s designs from the 1930s are still relevant and furniture designed by Ilmari Tapiovaara and others in the 1950s and ’60s is in production again.<p><p>But Finland also boasts a new generation of gifted designers who are creating 21st-century furniture: Timo Ripatti, Antti Kotilainen, Mikko Laakkonen, Ilkka Suppanen and Terhi Tuominen, to name a few. Harri Koskinen’s Muu chair was awarded the prestigious Compasso d’Oro a few years ago.<p><p>Wood continues to be an important material, and technical innovations have generated new possibilities for structure and form. Plywood can be pressed and bent in new ways. Structures constructed of thin ply, such as Jouko Kärkkäinen’s acoustic wall elements, are solid yet almost translucent. Through heat treatment, Finnish woods can become hardened and moisture-resistant.<p><p>Environmental aspects now form considerations in furniture design. Materials are sourced locally, there’s an effort to manage production ecologically and product life-cycle is taken into account. Durat, a material made of recycled plastic, is suitable for use in sheet-type structures, such as Eeva Lithovius’s tables and benches. Rapidly growing bamboo has claimed a place along local wood. An extreme example of environmental design is Samuli Naamanka’s Compos chair: the seat is 100 percent biodegradable natural fibre polymerized from linen and corn sugar and the leg structure is reusable steel. (AV)<p><p>Eero Aarnio (born 1932) is one of Finland’s most famous working designers. Everyone remembers the Ball chair, the Pastil chair, and the Puppy chair – strong forms, powerful colours, fibreglass, acrylic, original ideas. The Ball chair, which appeared in 1963, became Aarnio’s first international success. He garnered significant attention in 2008, receiving the Kaj Franck Design Prize in Finland and the Compasso d’Oro in Italy. He was the third Finn ever to receive the Italian prize.<p><p>At first glance, Aarnio’s products don’t conform to the typical characteristics of Scandinavian design: they are unusually rich in form, colour and surprise. But behind them lie solid Scandinavian functionality and practicality. The shape of the Pastil is excellent for sitting. And the Bubble chair is manufactured like a soap bubble, by blowing – ingeniously simple. Form and material go hand in hand: the material – wood, plastic, acrylic, fibreglass – makes the form possible, while the form dictates which material can be used in its manufacture.<p><p>Aarnio continues to be full of ideas in his senior years. His design process is rapid, generating new products for every exhibit. In recent years, Aarnio has focused on lighting design, bringing surprising new innovations to the field through his ideas about form. Aarnio knows the ins and outs of manufacturing techniques, especially working plastic, and understands how to make a product as cost-effectively as possible – without, of course, sacrificing quality or form.

High-end craftsmanship, intriguing organic forms and an incomparable wow factor separate Finnish artisans from the pack.<p><p>“The basis of influence for jewellery can come from any part of one’s life,” says Marisanna Multamaa, a Tampere-based jewellery designer. “Organic forms are a natural draw for many people.” Multamaa studied at the Institute of Design in Lahti.<p><p>Eero Hintsanen of the label Chao &amp; Eero also studied there, in a different year. He notes that many of his counterparts in the field respect the Lahti programme, which has become a cornerstone of the goldsmith and jewellery industry in Finland.<p><p>Tampere-based artisan Marisanna Multamaa’s designs have been worn by former Finnish President Tarja Halonen. Photo: Pia Grochowski<p><p>For Multamaa, the choice to become a jewellery designer is based on several factors. Her background reflects the long history of the trade in Finland. “There has been a tradition of smiths in my family since the 1800s,” she says. “I’ve always been an artistic person. When making new works, I feel that I’m in my element.”<p><p>She opened her shop in 2006, and has been in demand ever since. Her most renowned design is the Mustikka (meaning “blueberry” in Finnish) jewellery sets. Former Finnish President Tarja Halonen, who may be her most famous fan, wore Multamaa’s Mustikka necklace on a number of outings.<p><p>Like many jewellery designers from Finland, Multamaa handcrafts all her creations from start to finish. It’s a time-consuming process: A Mustikka necklace requires a full day’s work.<p><p>The quality of handcrafted jewellery forms a distinguishing factor on the Finnish scene. Chao &amp; Eero’s emphasis on handcrafted quality pieces have earned much respect in Finland and abroad. “There is a lot of value in traditional craft that can’t be replaced,” Eero Hintsanen says. “The challenge is to market it right.”<p><p>Chao &amp; Eero first got into Japanese market through a company in the Kansai area selling Nordic design products. As the company’s confidence grew, it decided to open a shop for Chao &amp; Eero in Kyoto, and obtained exclusive rights for distribution in Japan.<p><p>Called Melumo Putiikki, the shop has two stories. The upstairs is devoted to Chao &amp; Eero, the downstairs to bags and accessories. In order to serve their customers, they have sent staff to Chao &amp; Eero’s studio in Lahti to learn about the stories behind the collections and see how everything is made. In this age of mass-produced products manufactured in questionable conditions, Japanese customers appreciate knowing exactly how and where Chao &amp; Eero’s jewellery is created.<p><p>Time and dedication is what makes the quality of Finnish jewellery so known. A necklace like this is handcrafted by the artist herself. Photo courtesy of Design Marisanna Multamaa<p><p>“Good quality is your responsibility,” says Hintsanen. He and his wife Chao-Hsien Kuo believe that while new technologies such as 3D printing are being mentioned as the next big thing in the field, they cannot replace the quality, dedication and perfection in a handcrafted piece.<p><p>Rather than opening a shop in Finland, they set up an online store and work at their studio in Lahti. Chao hails from Taiwan, but she has lived all over the world. The couple see themselves as born global, and their customer base reflects this. While their jewellery is very Finnish, they don’t focus solely on Finnish customers.<p><p>Chao is a city girl who is inspired by nature; Hintsanen is a country boy who is interested in graphic and urban designs. He notes that she has a good eye for observing little details in nature, which become the basis for pieces of jewellery. The name of a piece may provide a clue about the original inspiration, but the design may be very abstract.<p><p>Cosima Friesen, owner of Hopea, sells vintage pieces such as this one by renowned Finnish designer Liisa Vitali.

In 2011 she started Hopea, an online shop for vintage Nordic jewellery. It’s been gaining much praise and attention, and was recently featured in Canada’s premier fashion magazine Flare. While many of Friesen’s customers are Nordic design connoisseurs, she also has many who are just attracted to the shapes.<p><p>“In Finnish design, they have really made an aesthetic commonality in natural shapes,” says Friesen. “I often hear it’s organic, it’s unusual, it has that wow factor –more so than other Nordic designers.”<p><p>By Pia Grochowski, December 2013<p><p>Born in history<p><p>Send the repairman home<p><p>Going global<p><p><p><p><p>", "time": "2013-12-05T12:35:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

In 2008 came Purge, which follows two different generations of women in Estonia during and after the Soviet occupation. The novel earned Oksanen international recognition, including the European Book Prize and the Prix Femina Étranger. Known for her feminist sensibilities, Oksanen regularly comments on social issues in the Finnish press. She is also a playwright.<p><p>Photo:Pia Grochowski<p><p>Arto Paasilinna (1942–2018) was born in Lapland. He found his place in literature after practising various trades. Author of numerous novels, he gained international praise for The Year of the Hare, a story of pastoral tribulations by a narrator who befriends a hare. Translated into over 20 languages, this novel became the first in a long series of literary successes, particularly in France. Critics praised him for his use of sarcasm combined with an extraordinary sense of narration and farce, qualities that give his stories an unmistakable tone.<p><p>Photo: Pia Grochowski<p><p>Väinö Linna (1920–1992) forms one of the most influential Finnish writers of the post-war era. Originally a worker from a simple background, he took part in the Fenno-Soviet wars of 1939–1944. This experience led him to write a realistic novel, The Unknown Soldier, that earned him great success. In another book, Under the North Star, he painted a historical portrait of a Finnish family across many generations attempting to describe the social reality in familiar settings. Many of Linna’s novels have been adapted into films.<p><p>Photo:Jouni Harala/Otava<p><p>Born in 1980, Riika Pulkkinen caused a sensation with the 2006 release of her first novel,The Border, in which she featured characters struggling with violent internal conflict. The book also covered topics such as Alzheimer’s disease and euthanasia. She later confirmed her literary talent with two more novels, including True, in which she continued to explore struggles of the human soul. Highly regarded as a novelist, she also regularly writes columns in the Finnish media.<p><p>Photo: Posts and Telecommunications of Finland Archives<p><p>Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872) began as a playwright. Of all his plays, Heath Cobblers continues to be the most popular. He spent ten years writing The Seven Brothers, which was published in 1870 to mixed reviews. It forms a scathing, yet truthful depiction of Finnish rural life. Exhausted by work and illness, Kivi passed away as a destitute man at the age of 38. Today he has been promoted to the rank of national writer, for he is reputed to have paved the way for Finnish-language literature (before him, the bulk of Finnish literature was written in Swedish). He also left behind many poems, some of which have been turned into songs.<p><p>Photo: Courtesy of Tammi<p><p>Born in 1943, poet and novelist Hannu Mäkelä has had a particularly productive career. His works for children, based on the imaginary Mr Boo, a farcical character who appears to children at night, earned him much success and international recognition. Since 1973 Mäkelä has published a series of stories based on this popular character. Mr. Boo’s popularity has been amplified in the music of M.A. Numminen, a singer of unbridled imagination, who transcribed the adventures of this imaginary character into music, to the delight of young Finns.<p><p>Photo: Tomas Whitehouse<p><p>Since her first novel was published at the age of 12, Leena Lehtolainen (born in 1964) has become known for her thrillers, such as My first Murder, Her enemy and Copper Heart, which feature police inspector Maria Kallio.

In one multigenerational family home in a leafy area of Helsinki, a soundproof floor and 83 years separate the house’s youngest occupant (8) from the oldest (91).<p><p>Elderly care in Finland is getting expensive. Medical care is expected to double by 2040, with 1.6 million Finns (27 percent of the population) living in retirement by 2040, according to the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). The amount of young pensioners (65–74 years old) will peak in 2020, and some say it is already difficult to find space and resources for the elderly.<p><p>Some people see sharing space with elderly relatives as burdensome, while others regard it as a way to bring the family closer together. A relatively new trend in Finland these days is families who share homes with grandparents, so they can help out with the kids and spend more time together. Finnish architect Tuomas Siitonen has designed an innovative home that shows how one family can live together under one roof while also allowing individuals to maintain their privacy.<p><p>Off the main dining area, the second-storey patio makes you feel like you’re in an exotic tree house. Photo: Maija Luutonen<p><p>The angular wooden home, nicknamed House M-M, is set in the midst of a stunning forest, drenched in light from the northeast side, where the three bedrooms are situated. Outside, the home is covered in Finnish-grown Siberian larch on a pine frame. The windows are reflective, showing patterns from the nearby trees whether they’re in full leafy greenery or covered in sugary snow.<p><p>Inside, the main living room is built on an ash floor and lit by a chandelier on a slanted ceiling. A loft-like lounge overlooks the room, providing a chill-out space with cushions, records and a view of the forest.<p><p>With 170 square metres (1,830 square feet) of floor space, the home is designed for a family of more than four. Vilma and Juho live on the second floor with their two children, ages 8 and 13. Their great-grandmother lives in the wheelchair-accessible flat downstairs, while their grandparents live next door, on the same plot of land.<p><p>“Homes for the elderly are full,” says Vilma. “Some are expensive. It’s hard to find a place. Our arrangement gave us an escape from that situation.”<p><p>The garden boasts a big terrace adjoining the dining area. The entire building was designed to follow the contour of the surrounding forest and garden, which contains a number of apple trees. Since most of the rooms and windows are on the second floor, it has the feeling of a tree house – you can almost pick apples from the windows.<p><p>A loft-like lounge overlooks the main living room, providing a chill-out space with cushions, records and a view of the treetops. Photo: Maija Luutonen<p><p>The homeowners first approached Siitonen to build a home that would not only hold a multigenerational family but last for lifetimes, as well. “They wanted to build a flat that would include their grandmother,” says Siitonen.<p><p>Vilma and Juho were looking for a cozy, uniquely designed space that is ecological and practical enough to stand for many decades. With geothermal heating and lots of sun from the big windows, the rooms suit both adults and children. The generous amount of common space allows them to share family time.<p><p>“The best thing about this house is that it really belongs in its environment,” says Vilma, referring to how the house fits into the surrounding Finnish natural landscape. “It really feels like it has always been there. The house is heated by geothermal heating and the large windows allow a lot of sunlight in. The big balcony gives us some extra space. We get the wood for the fireplace from the site. We go to work by train; the station is just a few minutes away.”<p><p>“We truly believe these are the things we need for the rest of our lives,” she says.<p><p>By Nadja Sayej, October 2013<p><p>Peek inside the tree house<p><p>Building from the ground up<p>", "time": "2014-02-18T13:00:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "The new edge of Finnish architecture - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/the-new-edge-of-finnish-architecture/", "review": "", "content": "<p>A lot has happened in Finnish architecture since the days of Alvar Aalto, regarded as the most influential architect of modern Finland. The minimalistic and aesthetic lines distinctive in contemporary Finnish architecture are ubiquitous in the country’s public and residential buildings.<p><p>Finland has now unleashed an environmentally aware and more global architecture with outcomes that are getting international praise and prizes. A striking example of new Finnish architecture is the Helsinki Central Library, open as of December 5, 2018. The new library has received the name Oodi (Finnish for “ode”).<p><p>When the results of the architectural competition for the Helsinki Central Library were announced in June 2013, ALA Architects had already earned recognition as a leading Nordic architecture firm.<p><p>Their first international breakthrough came in 2005 when they won the first prize in the open competition for the Kilden Performing Arts Centre in Kristiansand, Norway. “When we entered the Kilden competition we were just a bunch of kids working together,” says Juho Grönholm, one of the ALA partners. Nowadays that bunch of kids is a bit older, but going strong.<p><p>ALA Architect Partners (from left to right) Samuli Woolston, Juho Grönholm, Janne Teräsvirta, Antti Nousjoki believe that architecture reflects a common will of an era. Photo: Tuomas Uusiheimo<p><p>The central library is a pioneer project selected by the Finnish government in celebration of the centennial of Finland’s independence, in 2017. It has been predicted that it will be a role model for the next generation of libraries. “Good architecture makes us tick,” Grönholm explains. “It’s about creativity, individuality and leaving one’s comfort zone.”<p><p>The decision to build the library’s façade from Finnish spruce is part of a new trend: ecological, local and energy efficient materials are increasingly guiding the construction industry. The building will be extremely energy efficient. “Architecture is a reflection of a common will of an era,” Grönholm says. For the architects of ALA, it’s important to, “act globally but think locally.”<p><p>From 1970s-era prefabricated buildings, to the steady modernist ideas of the 1990s generation of architects, we have arrived in an era of cutting-edge wood architecture of the new millennium. According to Juha Ilonen, architect and author of several books on Helsinki architecture, climate change is currently adding pressure in favour of wood construction and design.<p><p>“Wood is related to sustainability, but, especially for Finns, it’s also related to our national identity,” Ilonen says. “Wood was here before Nokia and Angry Birds, so it is an essential part of our identity,” he says, and smiles.<p><p>Juha Ilonen welcomes diversity in architecture, saying it is getting more acceptable to design avant-garde buildings. Photo: Pia Grochowski<p><p>In Finland, the most densely forested country in Europe, timber products have a very bright future. “It will probably be used more and more in Finnish architecture.”<p><p>In concurrence with this trend, Aalto University based in the Helsinki metropolitan region, is offering a one-year programme on wood and wooden architecture. Finland’s first public building made of prefabricated solid wood panels was opened in 2013, the new Haltia Finnish Nature Centre designed by Lahdelma &amp; Mahlamäki Architects.<p><p>The ethics of sustainable development, new safety regulations, and the strong tradition that Finns have in the use of wood in construction “have enabled its comeback in architecture,” explains Ilonen.<p><p>Ilonen talks about “the wow effect” people are currently looking for in architecture. According to him, the Helsinki Central Library has it. “The real wow effect will be experienced in its breathtaking interior,” he says, rather than its wooden surface and curved lines. Multiculturalism and globalisation play a vital role in welcoming diversity in architecture. “It’s now easier to accept more original or avant-garde buildings,” Ilonen says.<p><p>By Carina Chela, September 2013, updated November 2018<p><p>The kids behind the library<p><p>The new trend, the wood edge<p>", "time": "2014-06-27T06:19:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The concept, both fun and educational, is even becoming an export business.<p><p>Children around the world generally like sweet, fun, bubblegum-flavoured music. Hevisaurus, however, takes a different stance: The quintet’s show unites heavy metal and dinosaurs. Decked out in full-length dinosaur costumes, the band plugs into amps that reach a child-friendly 85 decibels onstage.<p><p>Aimed at youngsters between two and nine years old, the band played their first gig in September 2009. The same year also saw their debut album Jurahevin kuninkaat (Kings of Jurassic Metal) comfortably reach number five on the Finnish Album Chart. With songs about chewing bubblegum, drinking milk and being a part of the ’Saurus army, their popularity has gone from strength to strength. In 2012, Kadonneen lohikäärmeen arvoitus (The Riddle of the Lost Dragon) hit the top spot on the local charts.<p><p>Despite their raucous stage show, dinosaurs are – surprisingly – much shier than you might think. The reptilian band directs this curious journalist to their human spokesperson, Jan Streng.<p><p>“Hevisaurus is about fun characters, nice stories, music, colours and lights,” Streng explains. “The band is suitably hard, but not scary.”<p><p>Incorporating both entertainment and education, the band fulfils many of the purposes of children’s music.<p><p>“The lyrics express themes that range from bullying to traffic behaviour, and send a message about how to behave correctly. However, while education is important, it is not the most important thing”<p><p>Given the presence of double kick drumming and howling guitar solos in their songs, it’s safe to say that lullabies are probably not one of the functions served by the Hevisaurus’s music. One thing’s for sure: They seek to get everyone in the household tapping their toes, if not banging their heads.<p><p>“Adults are undeniably very involved in our concerts,” Streng says. “This is something for the whole family.”<p><p>Proud that they’re into heavy music: Petri and the kids rock out in the living room to the tune of reptilian metal.Photo: Anna O’Sullivan<p><p>The TV is on at the home of Petri Niemi, with a DVD screening a live performance of the dino-metal musicians as they stomp their way through the popular single Räyh.<p><p>“My favourite band member is Komppi Momppi,” says Niemi’s six-year-old son Joel, before launching into an enthusiastic beat on a makeshift drum kit of pillows scattered about on the couch. Dad strums along on a ukulele, keenly displaying his lifelong love of heavy metal.<p><p>“Hevisaurus is well-played heavy music,” Niemi says a moment later as he catches his breath. “It’s all about letting kids go wild in a safe way.”<p><p>Joel’s passion for music has also expanded beyond the living room jamming space – he and his friends have formed their own band at daycare, where they play Hevisaurus tunes, among others.<p><p>“He listens to other music also, not just the heavy stuff,” Niemi emphasises. “But yeah, as a dad, I’m proud that he’s into heavy music.”<p><p>Green is the new black: Hevisaurus is becoming an export concept, reaching all the way to Argentina. Photo courtesy of Hevisaurus<p><p>The extent of the band’s success has also led to the concept being exported overseas.<p><p>In Argentina, the lyrics are belted out in Spanish at Heavysaurios shows. The other factor that differentiates the Argentinean shows from the Finnish gigs is that grown-ups are present in still greater numbers in the audience. The popularity of metal music in the South American country is such that there are many adults who attend the concerts even without children.<p><p>With plans to bring the heavy metal dinosaurs to other foreign markets in future, it appears that they are not likely to become extinct anytime soon.<p><p>By James O’Sullivan, September 2013<p><p>65 million years of musical evolution<p><p>At home with metal<p><p>Prehistoric export expansion<p>", "time": "2013-11-07T09:10:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Finnish comics draw a diverse fan base - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-comics-draw-a-diverse-fan-base/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Driven in part by a major annual comics festival held in Helsinki, Finnish comics are catapulting to international recognition. The world’s widely held respect for Finnish education expertise spills over into the field of comics, as well.<p><p>As they have grown in popularity, comics have also become better acknowledged as an art form in Finland in recent years. Numerous talented, original artists have emerged. Works by Kaisa Leka, Tommi Musturi and Ville Ranta are among those that have been translated into other languages – English, French and German, but also Polish, Portuguese and others.<p><p>Executive manager Kalle Hakkola of the Finnish Comics Society and Helsinki’s Comics Centre points out that translating Finnish comics is not a brand-new phenomenon: “Tove Jansson’s Moomin comics were published in some British newspapers as early as the 1950s, but translations of artistic Finnish comics took off properly in the late 1990s.”<p><p>Miia Vistilä, an artist and an intern at the Comics Centre, appreciates the facilities it offers for anyone interested in drawing comics. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Finnish comics have broken through in France, known as the stronghold of European comics, and are gaining audiences in Germany and North America. Cultural differences may pose an obstacle in some cases. “In Germany long graphic novels are a big thing,” says Hakkola, “whereas in Finland many artists focus on comic strips, which are much more popular here than in many other countries.”<p><p>Hakkola considers originality and visual courage the main assets of Finnish comics. “Here, people dare to do their own thing,” he says.<p><p>The comics that end up being translated do not have a certain thematic or stylistic tendency, according to Hakkola – there has been a lot of variation, and even some types of comics that could be regarded as difficult to translate have not been shunned. For instance, the website Finnish Comics reveals Pertti Jarla’s heavily wordplay-reliant strips and Jarno Latva-Nikkola’s bizarre, even lewd humor. “Actually, indecent humour is a theme that is appreciated by comic fans all over the world, as long as it is not overly culture-bound”, Hakkola says.<p><p>Hakkola presents the work of British artist Matt Boyce, who recently held a workshop at the Comics Centre in his two native languages, English and British Sign Language. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Anthologies of Finnish comics were released in 2011 and 2012 in English (Finnish Comics Annual) and in French for 2013 (La bande dessinée finlandaise). Hakkola says they received an enthusiastic welcome, despite the rather bold content choices made in the anthologies. The language for the 2014 version is German. “We want to concentrate on making the anthology in one language at a time,” says Hakkola, “in order to get the most focused result.”<p><p>Despite the success of the anthologies, he considers the Helsinki Comics Festival the most important promotion channel: “Without the festival, Finnish comics would hardly be as well-known across the world as they are today. It has become the main event for artistic comics in northern Europe.” Organised by the Finnish Comics Society, the festival is held in 2013 from September 6 to 8 on Lasipalatsi Square, and the main themes for the year are comics for children and North American comics.<p><p>Hakkola says that the festival’s success is based on the prioritisation of artistic quality over commercial recognition in the presented comics. Although it has an important function as a showcase event for Finnish comics, there is actually no particular strategy for their promotion on the festival organisers’ part: “We are confident that simply having artists, publishers and other related people in the same place leads to progress.” A good example of this is the festival’s Small Press Heaven, a sales event for publishers of self-released and small press comics, which helps new talents in making useful contacts.<p><p>The Comics Centre in Helsinki hosts a cosy café and a well-stocked comics shop with Finnish, foreign, independent and second-hand titles. Photo: Emilia Kangasluoma<p><p>Comics are enjoying increased acknowledgement, both as an art form and in the form of more financial aid from the government in recent years. The Comics Centre, located in the Helsinki neighbourhood of Arabianranta, is one of the projects that the funding makes possible.<p><p>It features a gallery, a café and a small shop, as well as two classrooms. The wide selection of courses held there includes classes for children and adults, beginners and advanced, long-term courses and one-day open workshops. Hakkola feels the courses are both fun and educational: “Drawing comics is a good way to improve children’s ability to ‘read images.’”<p><p>An important function of the Comics Centre is the export of knowledge and methods: pop-up comics centres have been organised in Germany, Russia and Estonia, and hands-on workshops have been held as far away as South Africa and Brazil. “The expenses limit our ability to work on the other side of the world to some extent, but there certainly is a lot of demand for Finnish know-how in the field of organising comics events and education,” Hakkola says.<p><p>By Kasperi Teittinen, September 2013<p><p>Visual courage<p><p>Bold content, enthusiastic welcome<p><p>Courses and events spread the word<p>", "time": "2013-09-06T07:20:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

With three days left before Gaga’s arrival, they needed something extraordinary. Parikka designed a pair of high-heeled platinum pumps for Gaga for the award ceremony.<p><p>“I was thrilled,” says Parikka. “For Gaga, you always need to design something extra.”<p><p>Parikka’s philosophy: “May these shoes lead you to new adventures.”Photo courtesy of Minna Parikka<p><p>It all started in high school. As the fable goes, Parikka was only 15 years old when she decided she was destined to become a shoe designer.<p><p>She stepped on a plane to England at 19-years-old to study footwear design. Upon graduation, she worked as a freelance designer in London and Italy until returning to Helsinki in 2006 to launch Minna Parikka shoes.<p><p>Now, her shoes and accessories are sold all over the world, including a shop on Helsinki’s Aleksanterinkatu, called Minna Parikka Universum. A sign there reads: “May these shoes lead you to new adventures.”<p><p>Best known for designing bombastic, colourful shoes, quaint leather gloves, little clutches and party purses that draw out every woman’s inner Catwoman, she creates work that combines sultry and vintage styles with a slap of fetish. She also has cartoon-covered footwear called Bugs pumps, which draws upon the inspiration of Disney and Hello Kitty (created in collaboration with artist Jani Leinonen).<p><p>“You have to allow yourself to be playful,” says Parikka. “Life is too short to take style too seriously.”<p><p>Minna Parikka teamed up with Jani Leinonen for “Shoe Liberation Army,” an exhibit at Helsinki’s Amos Anderson Art Museum.Photo courtesy of Minna Parikka<p><p>Her bright, candy-hued pieces are worn by celebrities and stars such as Fergie, performer Beth Ditto, first lady of Finland Jenni Haukio, and supermodel Kirsi Pyrhönen.

Meanwhile she is taking part in museum exhibitions like Stepping into the Limelight, a group show at the Grassi Museum in Leipzig, Germany (until September 29, 2013).<p><p>Parikka has inspired many younger designers, too. Since her company won the Timangi 2011, a young entrepreneur’s prize of 30,000 euros, a first-class Finnish postage stamp was printed featuring cherry red heels from her 2009 collection.<p><p>When asked what advice she has for young female entrepreneurs, Parikka says to “create your own universe and keep on developing it no matter what.”<p><p>Her designs include her Spiderwoman black heels or the Jacqueline pumps in a deep, red wine. One typical trademark is her “melt and drip” gloves, which feature cartoonish drop-shaped curves of colour that appear to ooze over the hands.<p><p>Parikka’s universe: A variety of bold styles are found in the Minna Parikka Universum boutique on Aleksanterinkatu in the Finnish capital.Photo courtesy of Minna Parikka<p><p>The more experimental designs include fetish-inspired masks and giant head pieces made from shoes paired on top of one another.

Although that scene isn’t extensive, its small size has actually given her the space to become the designer she desires to be.<p><p>“It doesn’t feel like you have to be running after somebody else or running after some current trends or design movements,” she says.<p><p>Fashion Flash Finland, a blog opened in June 2013, welcomes readers to “the Finnish fashion universe” with news, reviews, interviews and tips.

The Arteles Creative Residency Program in the village of Haukijärvi has brought over 220 artists from 39 countries to live, work and find inspiration in the Finnish landscape.<p><p>They also hold monthly events where residents show their works-in-progress. “Arteles is all about the freedom to create,” says the director, Teemu Räsänen, “and the possibility to go ‘out of the box’ without having any outside, work-life or art-world pressure.”<p><p>No outside pressure: Arteles exists to encourage creative freedom, far removed from the daily grind.Photo: Arteles<p><p>Finland’s northern ambience has been drawing artists to Arteles since Räsänen and his colleagues took over and renovated the old schoolhouse in Haukijärvi in 2010. The landscape boasts ample opportunity for hiking, swimming and berry picking in the warm months, and cold-weather activities such as ice skating once winter arrives. Several national parks are located within easy driving reach.<p><p>“Some residents have gotten really hooked and keep on coming back here,” says Räsänen. “Some have even moved to Finland.”<p><p>Guests stay in a restored timber house built in 1897 and fitted with seven guest rooms, two kitchens, and open-area loft spaces for creative collaboration, not to mention a sauna from 1961. The “creative freedom” approach means that artists have no obligation to finish what they start.

The sale of wine and spirits to the under-18s is prohibited by law. Customers may be asked to show a passport, identification card or driving licence as proof of age.<p><p>The retail sale of alcoholic beverages in Finland is a monopoly run along the same lines as in the other Nordic countries (with the exception of Denmark).

Finnish buildings are so well heated you’ll want to shed some of those layers when you get inside, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm, waterproof boots are an advantage in the slushy southern autumns, while fur or other thick linings are a good idea whenever the temperatures fall below minus ten Celsius.<p><p>Dress warm!Photo: Rodeo.fi/Juha Tuomi<p><p>Thick, padded jackets are likewise fairly indispensable wherever you happen to be in the winter, and truly essential in Lapland winters. If you are planning to try some winter sports, you will be able to purchase the right specialist clothing and footwear when you arrive in Finland. Staying dry is a priority in the sometimes stormy autumns, when Goretex and other waterproof materials come into their own. In the summer, casual wear is pretty much the same as in other parts of northern and central Europe – light trousers, shorts, tee-shirts – but evenings can be cool, so it’s a good idea to have a sweater and/or jacket at hand.<p><p>One of the great concepts in Finland is called “Everyman’s Rights”. Every woman’s too. This gives you permission to roam freely, pick berries and mushrooms, and enjoy the peace and quiet of the forests, lakes and rivers. Thanks to “Everyman’s Rights” you have far greater freedom to roam in Finland than in most other countries.<p><p>Everyman’s Rights is a concept that evolved over the centuries, an unwritten code created by a sparse population living in a vast, densely forested country. Just a few things to keep in mind. You can pick wild berries – but you can’t pick someone’s apples or plums. You can go canoeing and camping, but not too close to someone’s house. Don’t leave litter, and leave the place the way you found it.<p><p>Finland is officially bilingual: Finnish is the first language of 92% and Swedish of 5.5% of the population. About 1,700 people in Lapland speak Sami (Lapp) languages.<p><p>Swedish-speaking Finns, of whom there are about 300,000, are mainly along the coast of the south and the south-west archipelago and along the shore of the Gulf of Bothnia to the west. Swedish is the official language on the Åland Islands.<p><p>Finnish is the mother tongue of only about five million people in the world, so being able to speak foreign languages is essential for Finns. This is an advantage for foreign visitors, because many Finns speak English, German or some other European language.<p><p>Finnish has a reputation for being a difficult language, with many declensions and long words. You don’t have to learn how to pronounce these words, but to help you get started, here’s the word for hello: “Hei”. If you want to be cool, you can say “Moi.” After a delicious dinner, it’s always polite to say “kiitos”, pronounced “keetos”.<p><p>Getting here<p><p>Getting around<p><p>Time zone<p><p>Maps<p><p>Foreign exchange<p><p>Disabled Visitors<p><p>Health regulations<p><p>Public and National Holidays<p><p>Mosquitoes<p><p>Taxis<p><p>Telephone<p><p>Tipping<p><p>Lost property<p><p>Shopping hours<p><p>Shops<p><p>Drinking water<p><p>Emergencies and medical services<p><p>Tax-free shopping and export service<p><p>Credit cards<p><p>Banking<p><p>Postal Services<p><p>Dining &amp; wining<p><p>Drinking age<p><p>Clothing<p><p>Everyman´s rights<p><p>Language<p><p>By air<p><p>By rail<p><p>By car<p><p>By flight<p><p>By train<p><p>By coach<p><p>By car<p><p>By boat<p><p>Calls from Finland<p><p>Calls to Finland<p><p>Calls in Finland<p><p>Area Codes<p><p>24-hour emergency hospital treatment for foreigners with doctors on duty around the clock:<p>", "time": "2013-07-10T08:34:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Chief among these is the quintessential functionalism of his Stool 60.<p><p>With sales of around eight million units over the years, Alvar Aalto’s Stool 60 celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2013.<p><p>Aalto helped pioneer the groundbreaking process of bending wood, and applied it in creating the legs of his three-legged stool. The design allowed the seats to be stacked easily on top of one another, taking up far less storage space. Utilising birch wood, one of the most common broad-leafed trees in Finland, first saw cuts were made into the L-leg planks of wood, before a process that bent them to a 90-degree angle using heat and steam.<p><p>Stackable stools, and enduring, too: When a Stool 60 outlives its coat of paint, the wear and tear just seem to add to its charm.Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>Stool 60 was officially unveiled to an enthusiastic public in London at a Finnish furniture review in November 1933.<p><p>“Back then it was a surprise to the English audience and press that such a good design came from a little, unknown corner of Europe called Finland,” explains Mari Murtoniemi, educational curator at the Alvar Aalto Museum. “Aalto has been the flagship of Finnish design ever since.”<p><p>Situated in his former hometown of Jyväskylä, central Finland, the museum marked the stool’s 80th birthday with a special exhibition to tell its story.<p><p>“Aalto was one of the designers who created the image of quality and functionality that Finnish design is still appreciated for today,” Murtoniemi says. “He was a gate opener.”<p><p>Aalto’s designs were created for all to enjoy, and many of them appear in Finnish homes. Helping facilitate this is Artek, the furniture company that Aalto established in 1935 with his wife Aino, visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl. Also commemorating its 80th anniversary, the company introduced a series of special edition Stool 60s produced by various well-known architects and designers, and brought back a range with vintage coloured tops.<p><p>Timo Penttilä of Artek 2nd Cycle, which deals in recycled and vintage Artek furniture, faces the camera along with a portrait of designer and architect Alvar Aalto.Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>All things considered, 80 years is a long time in the design world. Just why has this simple stool endured?<p><p>“It was just genius,” says Timo Penttilä, from Artek 2nd Cycle, a branch that deals in recycled and vintage Artek furniture. “It was revolutionary back then and it has stood the test of time. There are many words to describe it: simple, beautiful, functional.”<p><p>Seeking to preserve the sustainable design of Artek furniture, the 2nd Cycle retail and exhibition space in Helsinki collects pieces from flea markets, schools, nursing homes and garages. While the company offers to restore each item to its original condition, each piece of furniture’s unique condition is greatly respected.<p><p>“We leave most of the items as we find them,” Penttilä says. “Each piece develops its own character over the years. Personally, I like stools whose paint has worn off from heavy use.”<p><p>And, given their ease of storage, Penttilä isn’t alone in having numerous Stool 60s stacked away at home.<p><p>“If we have a party at home, we have a seat for everybody,” he smiles. “Some people who work here buy one stool every year. My colleague Antti has around 15.

{"title": "Finland’s superwoman of glass art - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finlands-superwoman-of-glass-art/", "review": "", "content": "<p>One of Finland’s most unique and successful glass artists, Anu Penttinen lives in a tiny, picturesque village, but she finds inspiration in street maps, man-made environments, cityscapes and urban details – not the usual ingredients of Finnish glass design.<p><p>Penttinen has exhibited her eye-catching glass art throughout the world, including the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia. She also has her own shop, Nounou, in the downtown Helsinki neighbourhood of Punavuori, but lives in Nuutajärvi, a village located 150 kilometres (93 miles) northwest of the capital and known for its glassworks and glass artists.<p><p>“I like the process of glassblowing,” she says. “It is immediate, and you have to make quick decisions. I like how the hot glass behaves – it has its own personality. However, it’s not an easy material at all, and that’s why it keeps me interested.”<p><p>“Glass is more like a lifestyle than just a job,” says Anu Penttinen.Photo by Timo Junttila/Iittala<p><p>The most important element of her design nowadays is colour. For about a decade, she used only black and white. Then she started to integrate more colour. “It’s really challenging,” she says. “But at the same time, it’s interesting to come up with colour combinations that work well with the patterns that I use. It is never just one or the other – it’s colour with pattern.”<p><p>Penttinen works with glassblowing, kiln-forming and cold-working techniques, creating a wide selection of glass objects, from small boxes to lamps, glass birds and unique pieces of art. She is exploring the relatively new roll-up technique, where sheets of glass are fused, rolled to form a cylinder and then blown into a shape.<p><p>“It is an interesting technique, and the most important one for me at the moment, because I can do things now that weren’t possible before,” she explains.<p><p>Finland made its entry onto the international stage of glass design in the mid-1930s and has since soared from one success to another with such dominating figures as Alvar Aalto, Tapio Wirkkala, Kaj Franck, Nanny Still, Timo Sarpaneva and Oiva Toikka, to name just a few. For the designers of the present generation it has not been easy to get out from under their predecessors’ shadow, but glass artists such as Harry Koskinen, Markku Salo, Hans-Christian Berg and Anu Penttinen are now household names in Finland and abroad.<p><p>The combination of colour and pattern play the key role in Penttinen’s design today.Photo: Leena Karppinen<p><p>“Nowadays, it’s increasingly common for the glass artists to make their own work,” says Penttinen. “In the old days, none of the glass artists in Finland actually knew how to blow glass. And then again, there are many industrial glass designers today who don’t know how to use glass.<p><p>“Nowadays if you actually want to make a living from glass, and you make your own pieces with your own two hands, it is quite difficult to get it out there, to get the recognition. It is quite a new idea for people that you can actually make your own glass objects because in the old days they were just made in the factory.”<p><p>Glassblowing, a physically demanding process with its hot kilns and toxic chemicals, used to be a male domain. But no more.<p><p>The younger generation of glass artists do their own glassblowing, coaxing the material into divulging its secrets.Photo courtesy of Anu Penttinen<p><p>Penttinen was born in Helsinki but has been living for years in Nuutajärvi, a village that she describes as “a quiet place with a long history of glass making.”<p><p>“Nuutajärvi means a lot to me,” she says. “It’s a very good place to work and live, because glass is more like a lifestyle than just a job,” says Penttinen, who lives in the former home of Kaj Franck, one of the leading figures of Finnish design.<p><p>“There’s a special flair in the village, and that also means something to others who use the same material as I do, and think the way that I do.”<p><p>The town, the like-minded people there, and the surrounding nature serve primarily as resting points, rather than sources of inspiration. “It’s not as if I ever bring nature into my work, because my work is mainly inspired by big cities and details in the cityscape. But the environment here just makes it easier to be a glass artist.”<p><p>Nuutajärvi is populated by some of the finest glassblowers in the country. There are also artists, as well as students of glass design and glassblowing. About ten independent glass artists live and work here in their own studios and hot shops. The glassworks, which belong to the design label Iittala, celebrates its 220-year jubilee in 2013 – but Iittala is moving glass-art production to its main factory in 2014.<p><p>However, Penttinen emphasises, “This doesn’t mean that the village is closing down. It could be even something positive. It does not affect the village or the tourism. We artists have our own workshops and studios here. The designers here all have close ties to Iittala, and that will continue, just that production will move to another place.”<p><p>By Rebecca Libermann, May 2013<p><p>Lively colours and strong patterns play<p><p>Making a living from glass<p><p>220 years of Nuutajärvi<p>", "time": "2013-05-31T09:30:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

A steady harmonium – an old-fashioned pump organ – breathes out the chords of a dance tune.<p><p>The two musicians are Sara Pajunen and Jonathan Rundman. They started Kaivama, a progressive Finnish American folk band, in 2010. With backgrounds in classical and rock, the duo’s fresh take on traditional music has won them fans both young and old, among Finns and non-Finns alike. A concert tour of Finland is in the works for the future.<p><p>“The project is very unique because it’s not only a musical project but an exploration of heritage,” says Pajunen, a 32-year-old fiddle player.<p><p>Both Pajunen and Rundman, 41, who plays mandolin, guitar and keyboards, are 75 percent Finnish. They grew up in mining communities with large Finnish populations in the north-central US.<p><p><p><p>Video: Greta KaulFinnish American duo Kaivama (Sara Pajunen and Jonathan Rundman) show off the tune “Temporary” (“Väliaikainen”). They sing the first verse in Finnish, then continue in English.<p><p>Kaivama’s name comes from the Finnish verb kaivaa, meaning “to dig,” suggestive of the duo’s desire to uncover and explore their heritage. They got their start in the summer of 2010, when Pajunen was invited to play a festival and asked Rundman, whom she’d met at a Finnish Christmas carol service, to collaborate.<p><p>Their fiddle-heavy tunes – some traditional, others original – are based on Finnish folk music, whose lilting, upbeat schottisches, polskas and mazurkas were popular dances in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The band began touring across the US, releasing their first album, Kaivama, in 2011.<p><p>Though Pajunen and Rundman bring different musical backgrounds to Kaivama, both grew up surrounded by their Finnish heritage. “Finnish American life is just normal in that part of the world,” Rundman says. “My whole high school was filled with Finnish kids and people who could speak Finnish.”<p><p>Pajunen, a classically trained violinist who studied in Minneapolis and at the Helsinki Conservatory, was immersed in the Finnish folk tradition from an early age. Rundman had heard Finnish classical and church music, but says that, like most of Kaivama’s audiences, his interest in Finland’s folk tradition is newly sparked. As a rock musician, he finds Finnish music’s rhythmic shifts and driving undertones familiar.<p><p>“There’s aggression, and then there’s this sort of pastoral, ambient atmospheric beauty that exists simultaneously,” he says. “The minute I heard Finnish folk music, it was clear to me that this was crossover music. You don’t have to be Finnish to like what Kaivama does.”<p><p>Listeners on both sides of the Atlantic get caught up in Kaivama’s blend of Finnish and American sounds.Photo courtesy of Kaivama<p><p>Kaivama has established firm connections in Finland without ever performing together there. Through family and friends, early demo songs were played on Lira, the Finnish Broadcasting Company’s radio show for traditional music, before the band even played their first concert.<p><p>Shortly after the duo formed, Pajunen visited Finland to study with renowned folk fiddler Arto Järvelä. Järvelä expressed interest in collaborating with Kaivama, and in 2011 and 2012, the three musicians toured the US together.<p><p>“That really was a boost, because it was super fun and we learned a lot of new material,” Rundman remembers – enough new material to release an album, Arto Järvelä &amp; Kaivama, in 2012.<p><p>Järvelä, who comes from a family of famous fiddlers, brings his own musical background to the smörgåsbord, including a direct link back to the roots of the music in the Old World.<p><p>“Having Arto play with us brings the real Finnish tradition to what we’re doing,” Pajunen says. “We meld together, and we change a little bit and he changes a little bit, just like any collaboration. He’s the real deal.”<p><p>Pajunen and Rundman are adding a vocal component to Kaivama, singing in both Finnish and English. As for the future, Pajunen hopes to see Kaivama’s debut in Finland soon.<p><p>“The Finns might be quite interested in what we do, because [they] have always been interested in the ‘lost Finns,’” Pajunen says, referring to those whose ancestors left Finland long ago for a new life in the US.<p><p>By Greta Kaul, April 2013<p><p>Aggression and ambient beauty<p><p>Intercontinental bridges<p><p>Planning ahead<p>", "time": "2014-06-24T13:05:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Since 2006, a priest has regularly organised metal mass – mass for metal music fans – in churches around Finland.<p><p>It’s eight o’clock on a cold Saturday night in the southwestern Finnish city of Turku. Several hundred people enter Archangel Michael’s Church to attend a special kind of mass. In this service, a heavy metal band – complete with singer, bassist, drummer, keyboardist and two guitarists – performs the religious hymns.<p><p>“We didn’t change the lyrics of the hymns,” says Haka Kekäläinen, the 50-year-old priest presiding over the mass. “We only changed the musical arrangements to fit the rhythms of metal music.” He looks exactly like a metalhead: dark hair down to his shoulders, a long beard and – when he isn’t wearing his priestly robes – a leather coat.<p><p>This pastor, who belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, succeeds in combining his passion for God and his taste for metal music by holding “metal masses” at regular intervals.<p><p>People of all ages appear in the audience at the Turku church, but surprisingly few are metalheads. “At one of our masses, I noticed that the youngest spectator was two months old,” Kekäläinen says. “The oldest one was 87. We attract a lot of people who are not believers. We show them that it is possible to have fun in church.”<p><p>The man behind metal mass: Pastor Haka Kekäläinen combines his love of God with his enthusiasm for heavy metal.Photo: Tim Bird<p><p>Mika Mäkinen, a 30-something man with his blond hair in a ponytail, admits he only goes to the metal mass. “This is my ninth time,” he says.<p><p>Another man and his spouse, both in their 50s, attend every metal mass held in Turku. “We never listen to metal music. But here, we like the unique and fantastic atmosphere,” they confide.<p><p>The first metal mass took place in 2006, in Helsinki’s Temppeliaukio Church. About 1,300 people flocked to the event. “They couldn’t all fit in the church,” remembers Kekäläinen. Since then, the band, whose members are not all believers, has played in 95 metal masses throughout Finland and recorded an album. Its 8,000 copies sold out quickly.<p><p>To Kekäläinen, a special relationship exists between metal music and religious hymns. Pointing at his hymnal, he smiles and says, “You know, it contains some very cruel words. It fits with metal music.”<p><p>Within the Lutheran Church, the initiative has provoked very little criticism, which is probably due to the popularity of metal music in Finland. The country possesses a large mainstream metal music audience and has given rise to numerous world-famous bands.<p><p>The musicians of the metal mass band are not as famous, but they have received invitations to festivals in Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria. For Kekäläinen, the adventure is far from over. He announces, “In 2014, we want to launch a weekly metal mass in Helsinki. We will probably also record a new album.”<p><p>By Pauline Curtet, March 2013<p><p>Adventure far from over<p>", "time": "2013-04-02T07:26:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Finland launched my music career - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finland-launched-my-music-career/", "review": "", "content": "<p>“I would probably never have achieved all this professionally without a summer job in Finland back in the 1970s,” says French American Kevin Kleinmann, who has enjoyed a triumphant career in the classical music industry and arts management.<p><p>It all started with the Helsinki Festival in 1975. A summer job there gave Kleinmann exceptionally valuable work experience in PR and media relations, as well as introducing him to the classical music business. It also turned into a seven-year stay in Helsinki.<p><p>Those years offered a cornucopia of connections to top artists, both Finnish and foreign, and led him into the recording business and the creation of a totally new label, Finlandia Records. This, in turn, opened the gates to the international music industry.<p><p>Since leaving Helsinki, Kleinmann has held senior positions at CBS Records (Sony Classics), Philips Classics, PolyGram Classique France and PolyGram/Universal Music International. He now works as adviser to the classical board of Universal Music International and as professor of arts management and cultural policy at the Sorbonne in Paris.<p><p>Young Kevin Kleinmann first travelled to Helsinki in 1975 from Germany on the MS Finlandia, and later created Finlandia Records. Photo courtesy of K. Kleinmann<p><p>As a young American music student, Kleinmann arrived in Hamburg, Germany to study violin and musicology. He rented a tiny room in the house of the great German pianist Christoph Eschenbach. Kleinmann was enlisted to collect the mail and take phone messages for Eschenbach.<p><p>“Legendary director and founder of the Helsinki Festival Seppo Nummi often had reason to contact my landlord, so we chatted on the phone,” says Kleinmann. “I found him a very fascinating person and told him of my interest in working at a music festival to learn the business. His immediate answer was, “You should come and work in Helsinki as an office assistant. ”<p><p>“I took the next ship to Helsinki. I initially planned to stay for only three months, but that adventure ended up being extended by seven years.”<p><p>“In those amazing years, the 1970s, I found Finland truly exotic,” Kleinmann recalls. “It was fresh and unspoiled, with an original spirit. As a foreigner I was treated like an exotic bird and I loved that!”<p><p>“I was determined to learn Finnish, and took courses at Helsinki University. I became a translator for the Helsinki Festival and many others. I was struck by the creative energy that you could sense everywhere back then.”<p><p>“Finland was a nation boiling over with creative individuals, still forging its national identity. So many great composers actively working and appreciated by the Finnish general public; excellent young aspiring architects; glass-art designers like Timo Sarpeneva, Oiva Toikka and Kaj Franck; textile artists like Armi Ratia, Maija Isola and Markku Piri; and writers like Arto Paasilinna.”<p><p>Finnophile: Kleinmann’s Paris flat is full of Finnish design items, including Iittala glassware, Artek’s Alvar Aalto furniture and more. Photo: Didier Delmas<p><p>“I quickly realised that I liked it in Finland,” says Kleinmann. “All the possibilities I was given to do and create, at my age, would have been impossible anywhere else at that time. For me it was an El Dorado, with treasures that hadn’t yet been exhausted and a rich culture that was still unknown to so many outside of its borders.”<p><p>“That’s where my idea came from to create a new record label devoted principally to Finnish music. I presented my idea to the Finnlevy label’s managing director, John Eric Westö, and chairman, Roger Lindberg, powerful music figures of the time. I started to develop an export network for Finlandia Records throughout the world.”<p><p>A French American who lived in Finland promoting its music made foreign audiences curious. The international press wrote stories about the foreign champion of Finnish classical music who had created a record label at the tender age of 22.<p><p>Kleinmann believes that Finland is, without a doubt, a music powerhouse. “Finland has more world-class musicians and composers per capita than any other country in the world. That is not only my opinion, but is something that is acknowledged and respected throughout the entire music world. We call it ‘the Finnish music miracle.’<p><p>“Many people have asked me to explain this. I always answer that creativity of all kinds can only come from an environment that combines education in the necessary skills with a creative force that is encouraged and nurtured by the society. Finland made the wise decision, more than half a century ago, to make music education a priority and the world can now see and hear the marvelous results.”<p><p>By Vesa Kytöoja, March 2013<p><p>Young American in Finland<p><p>Creating a record label<p><p>Music powerhouse<p>", "time": "2013-03-18T09:16:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

As frocked brunette models with updos sauntered down the runway, singer Arja Saijonmaa’s version of the melancholy “Partisan Waltz” played in the background.<p><p>Characterised by bold prints with a nostalgic ’60s and ’70s mood, Ivana Helsinki was created by sisters Paola and Pirjo Suhonen and has gone where no other Finnish fashion label has. In 2007 it became the first Scandinavian fashion label to be invited to the prestigious Paris Fashion Week, and it formed the first Finnish brand to be included in New York Fashion Week. Fans include Danish photographer and former model Helena Christensen, American actress and singer Juliette Lewis and British journalist and model Peaches Geldof.<p><p>Yet Paola Suhonen, 38, maintains that she is not a fashion designer. “Ivana Helsinki has always been more about art than fashion,” she says. “We’ve always created our own narrative and not followed the seasonal dictates of look books.”<p><p>The Velvet Lake collection reflects the “perfectly still moment before the surface of the lake freezes.” Photo Susanna Alatalo<p><p>When the sisters started the environmentally and socially responsible line of clothing and accessories fifteen years ago, it was woven around the tale of a fictitious Ivan J. Pavlovski who owned a match factory tucked away in the northern woods of Scandinavia.<p><p>The year was 1998 – well before brands had adopted storytelling as a means of conveying ideas, and before eco-awareness had become an expected value. From the beginning, all Ivana Helsinki clothing and accessories have been made in Europe; these days sewn clothes are manufactured in Portugal, Lithuania and Turkey, while all knits are made in Finland. Today, Ivana Helsinki is sold in more than 20 countries and has flagship stores on Elizabeth Avenue in New York’s NoLita neighbourhood and on Uudenmaankatu in Helsinki<p><p>“Story has always been an essential element: Ivana Helsinki is the biography of my life,” says Suhonen, who recently graduated as a cinematographer from the American Film Institute in Los Angeles and has also studied at the New York Film Academy.<p><p>Adventure formed the theme of Ivana Helsinki’s Camping collection in 2002, with a classic tent print. Photo: Susanna Alatalo<p><p>Following five years in the US, Suhonen moved back to Helsinki at the end of 2012.<p><p>“After I graduated, I had to decide what was next,” she says. “I had apartments in New York and L.A. and I was travelling all the time between those two cities and Helsinki. The lifestyle really wasn’t me – although I had many homes I didn’t feel I had a home in the spiritual sense of the word. When I considered my options, Helsinki kept coming up as the top choice.”<p><p>Suhonen, who has created patterns, concepts and products for companies including Google, Topshop, Swarovski, Coca-Cola, Canon, Amnesty International and well-known Finnish brands such as Artek and Pirkka, has also directed music videos. She completed a movie, Love Contemporary, about American adult entertainer Nina Hartley, and worked as cinematographer on Usagi-san (Mr Rabbit), a moving documentary about an elderly Japanese immigrant living in Los Angeles struggling to care for a wife who has Alzheimer’s disease. The film has received positive reviews.<p><p>Suhonen sees the transition from fashion to film as natural. “I’ve always loved film as a material, a way of conveying moods and ideas, and with fabric, which is more tangible, you can do the same.”<p><p>The Diamond, Stripes and Revolver collection by Ivana Helsinki made Finnish fashion history with its inclusion in Paris Fashion Week in 2007.

Here are the top 10, compiled from the thousands of answers that poured in.<p><p>Since the letkajenkka dance craze in the 1950s (yes, really, Google it – we dare you), Finland has turned out the occasional popular artist who captured the imagination of the world, but over the last dozen years or so, more and more bands have managed to break through internationally in their own genres.<p><p>With so many Finnish bands out there, playing to packed rooms of ravers, metalheads, indie kids and fans in countless other scenes, let’s look at who topped our survey:<p><p>Photo: Joonas Brandt<p><p>Playing its own brand of “love metal,” HIM is a rock band in the classic mould. Singer and songwriter Ville Valo has a decadent sort of charisma, while the band behind him churns out memorable riff after memorable riff. Their image consists of a romantic mixture of red velvet drapes and film noir charm, and the songs deftly explore that murky, fog-shrouded area where love and death meet. Active for over 20 years, they became global stars when their fifth album, Dark Light, was released in 2005. At this writing they’re working on their eighth album, Tears on Tape.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Ville Juurikkala<p><p>Hailing from the bucolic small town of Kitee close to the Russian border, Nightwish has become the North Star of symphonic metal, one that many others in the genre can’t help but steer by. Their international career started with Wishmaster back in 1999. The band has several world tours under its belt, with sold-out arenas dotting the globe. Mastermind Tuomas Holopainen has always been a fan of movie soundtracks and their newest album, Imaginaerum, inspired a movie of the same name, made by the band in cooperation with director Stobe Harju.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Hiroshi Manaka<p><p>These guys started out as teenage funk rockers bursting with energy, then evolved into a stylish rock band with just the right amount of darkness to give their pop-perfect songs an alluring edge. Back in 2004 there weren’t many places in the world you could go without hearing “In the Shadows” on the radio at some point in the day. Dead Letters, the album that single was taken from, formed a worldwide smash. The band is especially popular in Asia and Europe – one of its members now lives in Singapore and another in Italy – not bad for a bunch of teenagers who just got together to play some funky jams all those years ago.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Vilhelm Sjöström<p><p>Aku Raski, a.k.a. Huoratron, is a one-man seismic event and a form of rhythmic absolution. He plays an aggressive brand of dance music that tends to inspire communal vibes, stage invasions, intense dancing and joy. Huoratron is a musical battering ram to bring down the walls of apathy. In addition to releasing a couple of hot EPs and a full-length on US-based Last Gang Records, Huoratron has created remixes for global artists like M.I.A. In summer 2013 Huoratron’s pounding beats and squelchy synths hit the legendary Coachella Festival in the US.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Ralf Strathmann<p><p>The band consists of three classically trained cellists whose first brush with fame came when they arranged Metallica songs for their cellos. Since then they’ve developed into a world-class, modern, hard-rock band, albeit one without guitars. The distorted wall of cellos more than makes up for it, and the stellar cast of visiting singers and musicians puts every Apocalyptica album over the top and into the charts. They’ve teamed up with Dave Lombardo of Slayer, Gavin Rossdale of Bush, Till Lindemann of Rammstein and Joseph Duplantier of Gojira, among many others.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Anna Äärelä<p><p>This Espoo-based band has won over millions of people with its melodic pop rock. In recent years it has become one of the most-played groups on German radio. The band’s songwriter and singer possesses a deft touch with larger-than-life ballads, in addition to radio-friendly pop rock. Songs like “Hollywood Hills,” “Fairytale Gone Bad” and “Heal Me” capably pluck the heartstrings of the multitudes. Sunrise Avenue is definitely at its best in an arena environment. Their newest album, Out of Style, is released in 70 countries.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Lehtikuva<p><p>With singer, songwriter and guitar hero Alexi Laiho at the helm, Children of Bodom defies easy categorisation. Drawing from a number of metal genres as well as punk, the band has been labelled as everything from melodic death metal to power metal. It’s all that and more. Laiho is considered one of the world’s foremost guitar heroes at the moment and even has a signature model with ESP Guitars. Children of Bodom has ranked as an international phenomenon from the very beginning, and has produced a number of stone-cold metal classics, including “Hatebreeder,” “Hate Crew Deathroll” and “Are You Dead Yet?”<p><p> <p><p>Photo: Lari Laakkonen<p><p>These indie rock road warriors play a sunny sort of rock influenced by British indie and post-punk, as well as American surf music. French Films loves the road and spends a lot of time touring Europe, where their sweaty, exuberant shows have won them a steady following. Their records have been setting the blogosphere alight since the release of their first single, “The Golden Sea,” in 2010. They released their acclaimed debut album Imaginary Future in 2011 another is in the works. Thanks to their relentless touring, they won the European Border Breakers Award for 2013.<p><p> <p><p>Photo: J-P Passi/Kovasikajuttu © Mouka Filmi<p><p>Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät (Pertti Kurikka’s Name Day) consists of four middle-aged men who are mentally disabled. Their songs, harkening back to the classic punk sound of 1977, tell stories about their lives. Started as a part of a cultural outreach program in 2009, the band went on to take Finland by storm. It also forms the subject of a critically praised documentary film, The Punk Syndrome. Recently they’ve toured in continental Europe and been booked – both band and film – to appear at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas.

{"title": "Finnish blood runs in Nordic crime novels - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-blood-runs-in-nordic-crime-novels/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Brutal murders and bloody crime scenes aren’t what Finland is famous for – except in the world of fiction. With Nordic crime novels surging in popularity internationally, Finland’s contribution to the genre is unique.<p><p>The murder was particularly vicious. The victim had enemies in high places. The detective in charge of the case possesses a plethora of personal problems and is facing pressure from his superiors to solve the crime – or to leave it unsolved. This scenario might sound familiar, but don’t be fooled into thinking it’s just another crime story.<p><p>Over the past decade, crime novels set in the Nordic region have become bestsellers and given rise to blockbuster movies. Nordic crime fiction has attained such status that the decision to include it was easy for the organisers of Nordic Cool, a four-week festival of the arts with participants from all the Nordic countries, held in February and March 2013 at Washington’s Kennedy Center.<p><p>American author James Thompson’s crime fiction takes place in Finland, his home of many years. Photo courtesy of J. Thompson<p><p>American author James Thompson created his writing career in Finland, where he has lived for more than 15 years. He has a sizeable following in both Finnish and English; his newest novel, Helsinki Blood, is released in March 2013.<p><p>Thompson cautions that there is a difference between crime fiction and noir fiction. “Noir embraces a darker, sometimes even dystopian worldview,” he says. “In noir, the world may be in balance at the beginning of the story, but the balance is grim. The crime usually gets solved, but the world isn’t left a better place as a result, and the protagonist isn’t changed, at least not for the better.”<p><p>“Good does not always win in the end,” explains Tapani Bagge, whose book Punainen varjo (Red Shadow) is also published in March. “It is more hard-boiled. Also, many characters die at the end.”<p><p>Critics, authors and readers alike have tried to pinpoint the cause of the genres’ popularity. Some suggest that the root cause lies in how global readers view the Nordic welfare state model.<p><p>Yet there are simpler explanations: Both Bagge and Thompson think it comes down to the quality of the literature. The success of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium series sent publishers scrambling to find more Nordic authors, Thompson points out.<p><p>Leena Lehtolainen says of the main character in her newest crime novel: “She does not always follow the law, but she knows her own moral values.”Photo: Tomas Whitehouse<p><p>Leena Lehtolainen, whose book Her Enemy is released in English in spring 2013, explains her view: “I think the reader wants to feel that both she and the heroine are not powerless, that something can be done about the bad guys, that things can be changed, even though the price can be high,” she says. “The book can be dark, but there is an occasional ray of light in the main character, who does not always follow the law, but knows her own moral values.”<p><p>While any crime literature coming out of the Nordic region may share certain characteristics, the three writers say books from Finland are different.<p><p>“We have our common history and a long border with Russia, and it impossible to forget it,” says Lehtolainen. “The Eastern Finns have a temperament closer to the Russians than to the Swedes. We are part of the Nordic countries, but we used to be part of Russia, so we and our books are a link between the two worlds.”<p><p>“Finland is an eccentric and quirky country,” Thompson says. “Culturally, Finland is unique and exotic, unlike any other. Stories set in Finland can take you to new realms and expose the world to you in a way you never before envisioned.”<p><p>“We have more humour, and a certain Finnish craziness,” Bagge notes. “You will find more books from the criminal’s point of view, and not just from the detective’s. Also, Finns aren’t talkative. So in our books the dialogue is realistic, simple and particularly important.”<p><p>Jarkko Sipilä represents Finland at a gathering of Scandinavian crime fiction authors during Nordic Cool 2013 in Washington. Photo: Vesa Moilanen/Lehtikuva<p><p>All three authors agree the Finnish seasons are extremely important to their fiction. Lehtolainen says seasons are more than a backdrop, and weather conditions have a special meaning. Also, Finns behave differently in different seasons: “Darkness makes us melancholic,” she says.<p><p>“For me, when writing a tale set in Finnish winter, environment is so important that it’s almost a character,” Thompson says. “Winter affects every aspect of life. We gear our lives around it. Winter is a part of us, an antagonist and source of conflict. In ways, it shapes us.”<p><p>“Long, dark periods bring dark ideas,” Bagge says pragmatically. “In winter, you can hide bodies under icy lakes, or under snow drifts in the forest.”<p><p>“And the spring thaw turns up many or most of the people reported missing during the winter,” adds Thompson.<p><p>By David J.

The supergroup Tango-orkesteri Unto serves up a fluid blend of classic and contemporary, folksy and intellectual.<p><p>Finland’s first tango was performed on February 7, 1913 at the Apollo Theatre on Helsinki’s Esplanade, in a building that now houses the Ministry of Justice. The tango has since become an integral Finnish institution.<p><p>A century-or-so later, that tradition is most elegantly personified by Tango-orkesteri Unto. The ensemble is composed of six seasoned professionals from different fields of music, each with a list of credits as long as the Esplanade.<p><p>Vocalist Pirjo Aittomäki (left), pianist and arranger Timo Alakotila and four other musicians help make Tango-orkesteri Unto one of the most versatile tango groups around. Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>“I remember our first concert, at Expo ’98 in Lisbon,” says vivacious vocalist Pirjo Aittomäki over coffee at the Helsinki Music Centre café. “Afterwards a Portuguese guy came up to me and said that this was the most romantic music he’d ever heard.”<p><p>Since then, the band has wowed audiences all over Europe. The British label ARC Music has released three albums by the group. Now Unto has new territory in its sights: making a name for themselves in America.<p><p>The New World is familiar to the ensemble’s soft-spoken pianist and arranger, Timo Alakotila, a teacher at the Sibelius Academy. He has toured the US with folk bands JPP and Troka, which also included Unto’s violinist Mauno Järvelä and accordionist Johanna Juhola respectively. Just a couple of weeks before Unto’s debut, a nervous Troka appeared on Garrison Keillor’s legendary Minnesota-based radio show A Prairie Home Companion.<p><p>Aittomäki, meanwhile, has toured the world with British choral-pop band Adiemus and starred in musicals such as Les Misérables. With this background, she knows how to belt a song out of the ballpark when needed – or how to turn it into an intimate, suspended moment.<p><p>That range of expression plays an essential role in the breadth of material Unto tackles, including classics from the golden age of Finnish tango and originals that bring that tradition firmly into the 21st century.<p><p>Tango-orkesteri Unto takes its name from Unto Mononen, a composer active during the golden age of Finnish tango in the mid-1900s. Photo: Lehtikuva<p><p>The golden age of Finnish tango in the 1940s to ’60s was dominated by composers Toivo Kärki and Unto Mononen, who lent the band its name.<p><p>“Since the beginning, we’ve done traditional tangos but made them sound modern,” says Alakotila. “A great song can stand up to being interpreted in different styles and generations. Mononen and Kärki both wrote timeless melodies that are at the level of the classic Argentinean tangos – at least! You can really hear the passion and the melancholy.”<p><p>The way they play this music is elegant, mature and acoustic – far from the slick commercial style popular at the Seinäjoki Tango Festival and on Baltic cruise ships.<p><p>The band’s songs are also more literary, often featuring Finnish modernist poems as lyrics.<p><p>“I don’t consider it as being arty, though,” says Aittomäki, “because these poems are very down-to-earth. But they’re something more. I don’t want to say deeper, but poetry uses different words than standard pop lyrics.”<p><p>At a Tango-orkesteri Unto concert, you may find yourself swaying, tapping your toes or even dancing. Photo: Riku Isohella/Lehtikuva<p><p>Unto offers the sound of six virtuoso musicians at the top of their game, among the cream of Finland’s musicians from many genres.<p><p>What makes them swing then? A secret ingredient? It may have more to do with the absence of something: drums.<p><p>“That makes us very flexible with the rhythm,” says Aittomäki. “It’s more passionate than the traditional Finnish way of playing tango, which is very straight, a bit more stiff.”<p><p>Rather than drums, Unto relies on syncopated rhythms set by bassist Hannu Rantanen (of world-music band Värttinä) and guitarist and mandolinist Petri Hakala, veteran of countless groups drawing on Finnish, Irish and American folk.<p><p>“People rarely dance at our concerts, although of course it’s not forbidden!” says Alakotila. “It’s more concert material.”<p><p>Still, while this music makes you think and dream, you may well also find yourself swaying and tapping your toes.<p><p>By Wif Stenger, February 2013, updated July 2013 and and August 2015<p><p>Romantic range of expression<p><p>Timeless tunes<p><p>Dancing allowed<p>", "time": "2013-07-17T09:27:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "What Westerners weren’t supposed to see - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/what-westerners-werent-supposed-to-see/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Finnish Estonian writer Sofi Oksanen talks with us about her bestselling novel Purge. The first book ever to win both the Runeberg Prize and the Finlandia Prize, it also took the Nordic Council Literature Prize. By the end of 2012, four years after publication in Finnish, Purge had been translated into 38 languages.<p><p>Sofi Oksanen’s Puhdistus (Purge) topped the Finnish bestseller list in 2008 and won the prestigious Finlandia Prize, as well as several others. In February 2009 it went on to receive Finland’s other big literary award, the Runeberg Prize, named after the country’s national poet J.L. Runeberg (1804–1877).<p><p>Purge has the honour of becoming the first book ever to win both the Runeberg and the Finlandia, and Oksanen swept the board by winning the 47,000-euro Nordic Council Literature Prize as well, in March 2010. The English translation appeared in mid-2010.<p><p>In April 2013, Oksanen was awarded the Swedish Academy’s 42,000-euro Nordic Literature Prize.<p><p>Oksanen may be the only person in a position to write a book like Purge. Born in 1977, the Finnish Estonian author grew up in Jyväskylä, central Finland and spent her summers in Estonia – not in the capital Tallinn, where tourists were not unusual, but out in the country. Her grandmother lived on a kolkhoz, a Soviet collective farm, so going to see her meant visiting an area where no Westerners were actually allowed.<p><p>Thus Oksanen saw what Westerners weren’t supposed to see – “the real Soviet Estonia”, as she calls it. She is close enough to that world to have street credibility, but distant enough to perceive the bigger picture.<p><p>The novel flips back and forth between past and present, following Estonia from before the Stalinist deportations of 1949 until after independence in 1991. “It’s almost impossible for me to write chronologically,” says Oksanen. “I try to link things on a metaphorical or symbolic level, or just by intuition.”<p><p>The book also alternates between the main characters, two women from different generations: Aliide, a rural villager, and Zara, a victim of human trafficking. Both experience extreme violence and try to survive their lives in worlds that offer limited options, and where sanity often seems scarce.<p><p>“For the cover I wanted a big ear and a golden earring,” says Oksanen. Photo: R. Eiro; art: S. Sorsa<p><p>Purge appeared as a play before Oksanen wrote the novel, and she garners recognition from reviewers for her ability to build a plot full of suspense and drama. She writes prose that flows naturally, showing events in vivid detail.<p><p>Somehow you know what she means when she describes a kitchen as “mute and screaming”, or when Aliide thinks of herself and another character as “safe and together” when in fact they are neither. “My intention is to write in a musical way,” says Oksanen.<p><p>She changes gears at will, increasing the pace over the course of a sentence to keep up with characters as their minds race. Her style is warm enough to let the reader into their thoughts at their darkest, most painful moments. We experience their despair as they weather betrayal, violence, rape, injustice and fear, yet Oksanen never makes the reader feel like putting the book down.<p><p>The Finnish word puhdistus can mean “purge”, but it comes from the word for “clean” and can also be translated as “cleansing”. It denotes the deportation to Siberia of tens of thousands of Estonians under Stalin.<p><p>“When I was a child,” says Oksanen, “no one talked about deportations. People ‘went to Siberia’. Certain things were so dangerous to mention that people used a lot of expressions to circumvent the actual issues.”<p><p>“When I started the play and was thinking about the title, I was thinking about the traumatic reaction people can have after they’ve experienced violence or been raped,” she says. “People always try to clean themselves. So that was the first meaning – cleansing.”<p><p>Is it easier to write a novel after creating the story as a play? “A novel requires more background information,” Oksanen says. “You have to know a lot of things that you don’t need when you’re staging a play.<p><p>“I wanted to make the atmosphere and the world realistic in the novel. You don’t have to put the names of magazines and things like that into a script, because on stage the audience can’t see them.”<p><p>Telling the story in two different forms even alters the characters: “Even though I knew that Aliide was the type of person who would keep quiet, who wouldn’t talk things out or say them to Zara, in a play you have an audience. So in the play Aliide speaks more about what has happened. That’s a big difference.”<p><p>Oksanen has her sights set on her next two novels. Photo: Toni Härkönen<p><p>When a Finnish Estonian author writes a book that digs into recent Estonian history, you have to wonder about parallels with Finland. Of course Finland never formed part of the Soviet Union, but “there are a lot of strange incidents in Finnish history related to the Soviet Union,” notes Oksanen. Certain films were censored for political reasons in the 1970s, and part of Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago was published in Finnish in Sweden because no publisher in Finland dared to touch it.<p><p>Are any of the incidents worth writing a book about? “I think so,” she says. “How ‘Finlandisation’ affected the press is a big issue, and how it affected Finnish schoolbooks.” For now, however, Oksanen has her sights set on her next two novels. Both will deal with Estonia; she won’t reveal any more than that.<p><p>Just days before her Runeberg win was announced, she told us, “Winning both Runeberg and Finlandia would be quite unique. Finlandia is only for novels, while Runeberg includes all genres, which means a much greater variety of rivals.”<p><p>Topping it all off by winning the Nordic Council Literature Prize makes Purge even more unique, and the rivals came from six different countries this time. “It’s difficult for me to see the novel as exceptional,” Oksanen told Finland’s largest daily, Helsingin Sanomat, after Purge was selected over competitors from Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.<p><p>“Lots of readers from outside of Finland have said that the novel remains in their dreams for weeks,” she continued. “The feeling stays with you.”<p><p>By Peter Marten, February 2009; updated April 2013<p><p>The real Soviet Estonia<p><p>Musicality, pace and pain<p><p>Going to Siberia<p><p>Audience watching<p><p>Strange incidents<p><p><p>", "time": "2014-12-15T20:59:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Finnish vocal miracle still strong at 80 - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-vocal-miracle-still-strong-at-80/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Soprano Ritva Auvinen forms a legend of the Finnish opera scene with her illustrious and uncommonly long career. Now past her 80th birthday, she continues to delight listeners. What’s the key to the Auvinen vocal miracle?<p><p>In October 2012, a crowd came to hear Auvinen sing in her 80th-birthday concert at the Helsinki Music Centre. Excellent vocal material, dazzling singing technique and strong physical condition – do these explain the longevity and span of her career? “Well, I’d agree, but I’d add one important thing,” replies Auvinen. “I inherited strong vocal cords from my father. Two different doctors have told me that my vocal cords do not seem to have aged at all.”<p><p>Auvinen’s reputation is strongly linked to the first wave of international interest in Finnish operas in the late 1970s and early 1980s. An astonishing number of new Finnish operas were produced during that era, including two folksy works known in Finland as “fur hat operas”: Joonas Kokkonen’s The Last Temptations (1975) and Aulis Sallinen’s The Red Line (1978). Both gained international success.<p><p>The Last Temptations, a fictionalised, tragic biography of revivalist preacher Paavo Ruotsalainen, premiered at the Finnish National Opera in October 1975. Legendary bass Martti Talvela sang the lead role, with Auvinen co-starring as his wife, Riitta. She also frequently performed one of the main roles in The Red Line, that of Riikka, mother of a poor crofter family.<p><p>At her 80th-birthday concert at Helsinki Music Centre, Ritva Auvinen (born in 1932) sang an encore together with her older brother Raimo. The melody inspired nostalgia and a standing ovation.Photo: Marja Peura<p><p>Before The Last Temptations, Auvinen earned her spurs at Finnish provincial opera houses in the cities of Lahti, Tampere and Jyväskylä. These gigs hardly paid at all, so she bankrolled her passion for opera by working as a gym teacher and swimming instructor. As a girl, Auvinen could never have imagined a career as an opera singer. She recalls being a shy Karelian country girl who was “mad” about the pop songs of the day. Young Ritva particularly loved the Italian and German schlagers of the 1950s, which she sang at home, accompanying herself by “banging on the piano” in a completely homemade style.<p><p>Her older brother Raimo, an amateur singer, introduced her to opera, which quickly became a new obsession. However, it took quite some time before she began to systematically train her voice. Entering the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, she studied under the renowned Mirjam Helin – now the namesake of Finland’s most prestigious singing competition – whom Auvinen describes as a wonderful teacher who was ideal for her. But first Auvinen studied to become a gym teacher at the Helsinki University, which she believes laid the basis for her own enduring fitness as a singer.<p><p>Auvinen sings Riitta and Martti Talvela sings Paavo in Joonas Kokkonen’s opera “The Last Temptatations” at Savonlinna Opera Festival in 1987. Auvinen performed Riitta at New York’s Metropolitan Opera in 1983, and says the performance formed the pinnacle of her career. Photo: Kari Hakli, Savonlinna Opera Festival<p><p>When Auvinen performed her two great roles as strong Finnish country women, Riitta and Riikka, she not only sang radiantly and expressively, she also carried herself with elegant posture and a spring in her step.<p><p>“There was an unusual atmosphere during the rehearsals for the premiere of The Last Temptations, with people in the choir often weeping,” she says. “Some of them might have even gotten religion. I didn’t feel like crying, though. The director, Sakari Puurunen, told me that Riitta had to be a down-to-earth character, not too melodramatic.”<p><p>I recall a performance of The Last Temptations at the Savonlinna Opera Festival, where Auvinen, as Riitta, threw an axe threateningly close to Martti Talvela, who was playing Riitta’s husband Paavo, leaving for a preaching mission. Paavo was taking with him the family’s only loaf of rye bread, which infuriated the temperamental Riitta. “Luckily nobody got killed,” Auvinen says with a chuckle as she remembers how audiences were startled by her angry axe toss. This gym teacher has wrists of iron.<p><p>Auvinen and Jorma Hynninen perform in Aarre Merikanto’s “Juha” at Savonlinna Opera Festival in 2002. Photo: Matti Kolho, Savonlinna Opera Festival<p><p>Starting in 1975, Auvinen became a regular guest soloist at the Finnish National Opera. Yet she was never signed to a staff contract. Still, she has performed some 70 opera roles, all in Finnish productions.<p><p>“I’ve always been a freelance artist,” she says. “I didn’t want to have an agent, because I was afraid of becoming an agent’s slave. I went to Germany a couple of times for auditions, and I was worried that I might have to sign a contract.”<p><p>Auvinen has held numerous solo recitals abroad, and has also performed at major foreign opera houses, singing in seven cities as part of the National Opera’s successful international tours in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The pinnacle of her career, she says, was performing The Last Temptations at New York’s Metropolitan Opera in 1983.<p><p>Auvinen still sees herself as a shy Karelian girl. With her modest personality, she has no patience for diva behaviour.<p><p>Onstage, Auvinen has always managed to shed her natural modesty and become a dazzling performer. She creates powerful, personal interpretations, but says she is unable to explain where they come from. They have always just seemed clear to her. “It must be intuition,” she says simply.<p><p>Auvinen served as a vocal teacher for 15 years at the Sibelius Academy and at conservatories in Helsinki. She continues to share the secrets of her vocal miracle with private students, and keeps performing concerts for the rest of us.<p><p>By Hannu-Ilari Lampila, November 2012<p><p>The road to the opera<p><p>Sing strongly and carry an axe<p><p>A lifetime of performing<p><p>Modesty and intuition<p>", "time": "2013-01-29T12:35:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The disc is out just in time for the group’s 15th anniversary.<p><p>Most of the album was recorded at Magnusborg studio in Porvoo, east of Helsinki – a place full of visual-musical stimuli. “It’s an old wooden mansion on top of a hill,” explains Stakula. “There’s this big hall with old instruments lying around, including a broken-down piano from the late 1800s that suits our sound just right.”<p><p>At times, that sound suggests a house band at a haunted gothic castle, or knights riding out to battle with fanfares and flags, or a wild eastern European village carnival. “When we’re composing and rehearsing songs, it’s easier if we have some kind of visual image in mind,” says Stakula, his eyes twinkling.<p><p>“Like maybe we’re a New Orleans street band who’ve been handed classical sheet music and we’re playing it strong and full-on with heavy drums because we have no clue about classical music! Or maybe there’s a circus of the undead on this side and some good-looking grannies on this side and they’re trying to play together, but they can’t because there’s a hippo in between them – and so on.”<p><p>A six-man rock band without guitar, bass or vocals, Alamaailman Vasarat boasts wind instruments, two cellos, keyboards and an array of other odds and ends. Photo: Marianne Kyykkänen<p><p>Essentially a six-man rock band without guitar, bass or vocals, the group uses a broad palette of musical paints, from klezmer, ska and punk to jazz, tango and polka, not forgetting Arabic, Balkan and Roma styles.<p><p>Yet while some other groups throw many types of music into a kitchen-sink mess, Alamaailman Vasarat weaves them into a distinctive sound that’s remained consistent through many albums and personnel changes.<p><p>Central to the sound are exotic instruments such as Stakula’s sopranino sax, Indian oboe and custom-made Tubax – a hybrid tuba and saxophone with a dungeon-deep sound. Other band members play a pump organ, a melodica and a homemade theremin with a copper antenna shaped like a fish. (A theremin is an electronic instrument whose tone you control by moving your hands in front of antennas.)<p><p>Some might categorise the resulting sound as underground cabaret or steampunk, or lump them in with groups like Gogol Bordello or Hazmat Modine. Yet the Finnish band’s all-instrumental format makes their humour more profound and less tiring.<p><p>Don’t roll your eyes: Alamaailman Vasarat features sounds of cinematic proportions.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>The new album features more touches of both classical and metal. Those converge in the band’s double-barrelled electric cello attack – which is reminiscent of another odd Finnish band, Apocalyptica, that began exploring this sound around the same time.<p><p>Alamaailman Vasarat formed in the early 1990s as a duo of buskers in the Helsinki Metro – hence the subterranean name. Stakula says it may have been inspired by the Hammer of the Underworld, a weapon wielded by the giant Morgoth in The Lord of the Rings – “though we didn’t realise it at the time.”<p><p>At the turn of the millennium, they began touring Europe, North America and Japan and released their debut, which became an immediate hit on the World Music Chart Europe. So was their fifth release, 2009’s Huuro Kolkko, a playful concept album about a mythical explorer from the early 1900s. In 2010 they released an iPhone game.<p><p>Sarkula often creates compositions and sound design for games, films and videos, all of which feed into the band’s cinematic sound. The final track on Valta features wine drops falling from a great height in the big hall at the Magnusborg studio.<p><p>“It made a logarithmic pattern that was quite harsh yet natural; the kind that you can’t create with samples,” he says. “It was kind of bad wine, but it didn’t go to waste!”<p><p>By Wif Stenger, May 2012<p><p>Broad palette, distinctive weave<p><p>From Tolkien to iPhone<p>", "time": "2012-11-02T10:37:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Where are their musical roots? How is their debut album? And what does a Finnish band have to do with Nigeria?<p><p>Search online for “Northern Governors” and most of the references will be to Nigerian politics – but that’s set to change with the arrival of a Finnish soul-jazz supergroup by that name. Their debut album, This is the Northern Governors, appeared in late March 2012 on the legendary Blue Note label.<p><p>So does the band’s name have anything to do with Nigeria? Well, yes and no.<p><p>One of the album’s centrepieces – and a show-stopper during the band’s recent concert at the Turku Jazz Festival – is the infectious, horn-driven “Hela Huti”.<p><p>“That’s my tribute to the father of Afrobeat, Fela Kuti, who happened to be Nigerian,” says bandleader J.K. Louhivuori before the gig.<p><p>“But that’s just a coincidence!” protests keyboardist and vocalist Tuomo Prättälä with a grin.<p><p>“There are no coincidences; it’s all part of a master plan,” says Louhivuori with a wink, enjoying the playful, spiritual tendencies of this group, which he calls “easily the most fun band I’ve ever been in.”<p><p>And he’s been in a lot of them – as have most of the Governors.<p><p>J.K. Louhivuori strikes a pose.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>Besides playing actively in his two other ensembles (the jazzy Sun Trio and Big Blue), multi-instrumentalist Louhivuori is in hot demand as a producer, arranger, session musician, playing with the likes of Hugh Masekela and Randy Brecker.<p><p>Prättälä and Louhivuori are best known, though, for their work with two of Finland’s highest-profile female vocalists: Emma Salokoski and Yona. Louhivuori wrote, arranged and played much of Yona’s first two albums while Prättälä co-led Salokoski’s long-running band Quintessence before his successful solo career.<p><p>Louhivuori also happens to be Yona’s ex-husband and Salokoski’s brother-in-law – in fact the night the Governors ruled Turku, his brother and collaborator Olavi was backing Salokoski in Helsinki.<p><p>The tangled musical family tree doesn’t stop there: nearly all the Northern Governors are related to each other.<p><p>Louhivuori and Prättälä are cousins of bassist Osmo Ikonen (who also plays with pop-rock band Sunrise Avenue), while guitarist and singer Petteri Sariola and drummer Jyri Sariola are his second cousins. The back-up vocalists are sisters of Louhivuori and Ikonen.<p><p>They’re all descendents of Marjatta Pokela, composer of many beloved Finnish children’s songs, and Martti Pokela, master of the national instrument, the kantele, and founder of the Sibelius Academy Folk Department.<p><p>Coming from this kind of true-blue musical tradition, it’s startling how passionate the new generation is about African and American music. Along with Fela, their debut album honours Louhivuori heroes such as Prince, Miles Davis and Frank Zappa.<p><p>Rough and rowdy, heavy on groove and improvisation: The Northern Governors leave audiences begging for more.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>On Easter, many of the band members and their relatives (including four Louhivuoris and five Ikonens) honour another tradition with a gospel and soul concert at the Lutheran Church in their hometown of Jyväskylä.<p><p>Various groupings of the family band, which first played at Martti Pokela’s memorial concert, have toured in China, Italy and Kenya. The latter trip inspired Louhivuori’s tune “Safari Spots,” which features a loping guitar lead by Sariola.<p><p>“J.K. wrote most of the songs on the album with the rest of us adding a few bits,” explains Prättälä. “But a couple of the songs grew out of jam sessions.” These include the opening slice of Prince-ly funk, “Zero Point,” which starts with a robotic quote from electronic pioneer Nikola Tesla.<p><p>That kicks off an immaculately produced album with sleek horn charts, electronics and choral harmonies. After this, the live show (with an expanded line-up of 10 people) is a pleasant shock: rough and rowdy, heavy on the groove, improvisation and goofy gyrating from the backup singers.<p><p>The final encore is “Happy Souls,” the band’s gospel-tinged first single, featuring solos from everyone, including spacey Moog synthesizer squiggles from Prättälä. It ends with big grins all around, the dance-floor crowd begging for more.<p><p>This is an intelligent party band with infectious enthusiasm – catch them live if you can.<p><p>By Wif Stenger, March 2012<p><p>All relative<p><p>From folk to funk<p>", "time": "2012-11-02T10:38:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Despite his rapid success he soon felt he wanted to explore other possibilities of expressing himself as a dancer.<p><p>In 1988 he won the gold medal at the Paris International Dance Competition with B12, a solo that renowned dancer and choreographer Jorma Uotinen created especially for him. This became Saarinen’s breakthrough and realisation that he was finding his own way and taking the right steps. “With my dance I want to reach the unspoken, the inexplicable, the unnamed,” Saarinen explains. “I believe in dance that touches, in dance that speaks for itself.”<p><p>But he still needed to explore further. In 1992 he took off for Japan and Nepal to study dance through cultural heritage. In his own choreography, Saarinen feels he can come up with something “very poignant, essential and cohesive about us humans” by studying archetypes and typical situations.<p><p>Saarinen’s interest in the human psyche is strongly reflected in his work. He says he gets his ideas from living and observing life. He values “seemingly mundane acts and emotions” above all and pinpoints them in his work.<p><p>He refers to human beings’ ancestral knowledge: “We should not neglect being aware of the lives lived before us –and for us. Our minds and bodies have been given a rich inheritance by our ancestors that we should be aware of and nourish.”<p><p>Saarinen’s choreographies are a wonderful blend of contemporary and classical dance, martial arts and influences from Japanese butoh dance and spiritual rituals, often combined with live music and always accompanied by strong visuals.<p><p>Watching Tero Saarinen Company is like taking a journey into the subconscious of the human mind. Saarinen explains that dancers and choreographers have “a privilege and possibility to connect with the ritual essence of dance – man’s eternal desire to connect with oneself,” a connection he considers essential for his work.<p><p>By Carina Chela, May 2011, updated October 2012<p><p>Human psyche<p>", "time": "2012-10-09T08:22:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

He works as mobile services producer at the Alvar Aalto Museum.<p><p>The first-ever mobile application from a Finnish museum, AALTOsites, takes you on an urban treasure hunt.<p><p>Available in English, Spanish, Finnish and Swedish, the free app shows you where the closest Aalto buildings are; then provides a succinct background to help appreciate each one. Photos and drawings, more than 150 in total, illuminate each location. AALTOsites incorporates unpublished rarities, including sketches from the visionary architect’s notebooks.<p><p>“The app functions as a stand-alone exhibition of Aalto’s work,” says Summanen, who produced the app along with a small Helsinki software firm. “We’re always trying to bring awareness of his work to new people through new platforms.” A year in the making, AALTOsites was released in June 2012 in conjunction with the city’s year as World Design Capital.<p><p>The AALTOsites app acts as a guide to Aalto’s architectural creations in the Finnish capital.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>Like the designer himself, the museum has always enthusiastically embraced new technology. In 1994, it became the second museum in Finland to enable virtual visits through the new medium of the worldwide web.<p><p>“A few years later, Encyclopaedia Britannica picked our site as one of the world’s ten best – maybe because it was cool and minimalist and black-and-white at a time when everyone was trying to be as colourful and busy as possible,” says Summanen.<p><p>That same philosophy applies to AALTOsites, which lets you post your location and comments on Facebook – but so far not on Twitter or foursquare. “We wanted to keep it simple for now,” says Summanen.<p><p>Aalto himself was also quick to adopt new technologies.“In 1924 he and his wife Aino left for their honeymoon by airplane, which was a big deal in those days. He was very curious about new technologies and held many patents for inventions of his own, particularly for furniture production.” AALTOsites spotlights his product designs, such as the iconic Savoy Restaurant vase and Artek’s three-legged stools.<p><p>Summanen notes that, surprisingly, the furnishings and structures of most of Aalto’s buildings in Helsinki lack protected status. While the Alvar Aalto Foundation was consulted about the ongoing renovation of his 1958 House of Culture, it has recently expressed concern over plans to modernise the iconic Academic Bookstore.<p><p>Alvar Aalto designed this building – and its lampposts – for the University of Technology campus just west of Helsinki. In a fitting turn of events, the institution now forms part of Aalto University.Photo: Sinimaaria Kangas<p><p>Away from the downtown locations, AALTOsites guides you to three buildings in the leafy Munkkiniemi neighbourhood, including the Aalto family home. On the other side of the Helsinki city line, in Espoo, you find the classically inspired campus of the University of Technology – now fittingly renamed Aalto University.<p><p>One of the most useful elements of the app is an offline map. Its locator does not require internet access – though nowadays open wifi networks cover much of the city centre.Summanen is working on an iPad version, as well as a Jyväskylä section and a Japanese version.<p><p>So far, AALTOsites is only available for Apple and Android handsets. “A Windows Phone version would be quite a big investment, and there are still relatively few users,” says Summanen. “Of course, we’d welcome any ideas about cooperation.”<p><p>By Wif Stenger, September 2012<p><p>Inventor, adventurer and designer<p><p>Let’s get lost<p>", "time": "2012-10-05T13:23:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Hernberg is the founder of Urban Dream Management, which calls itself an “urban practice” and she also maintains an online journal. She first became interested in the way urban life in the Finnish capital was changing while she was writing her master’s thesis in architecture a few years ago.<p><p>She drew inspiration from Berlin, where she had been studying how people engage in self-generated, temporary projects that liven up abandoned wastelands and undefined urban territories. When she returned to Helsinki, she got a chance to collaborate with the design agency Part in a project to redevelop the empty Kalasatama (Fish Harbour) area by creating a strategy for temporary use while the neighbourhood is being transformed into a new urban district.<p><p>Working on the project with various citizen groups and NGOs made Hernberg realise that “there’s a lot of active, creative energy bubbling underneath the surface.”<p><p>At Ihana Kahvila (Lovely Café), they’re preparing for a movie screening.Photo: Johannes Romppanen<p><p>As Hernberg notes in her book, numerous urban grassroots movements and activities that encourage more sustainable lifestyles have flourished in Helsinki over the past few years. Activities range from setting up restaurants in people’s private homes to creating an urban garden in an unused rail yard.<p><p>One project repurposed a couple freight containers into a cosy café, and another gathers info on urban foraging locations – places where you can find fruit or berries in city parks and other public spaces. Other new services enable people to borrow sports equipment or locally designed fashion clothing, or to contribute their skills to a community “time bank” from which they can then receive services from other members.<p><p>Hernberg thinks that these kinds of activities are a sign that people want to interact and have an impact on their surroundings. “Being able to participate in the development and life of the city is very important, and there’s even solid research that this increases people’s happiness.”<p><p>Hernberg stresses that even the smallest actions can make a significant difference in a society. However, it is essential that the activities aren’t “designed from above,” but rather initiated by the people themselves. Though bureaucracy can sometimes hinder the public’s access to spaces such as disused industrial buildings in Helsinki, Hernberg remarks that the city administration has become much more lenient in recent decades, and “the importance of grassroots innovations is widely recognised by the city officials.”<p><p>Shaking an apple tree: Urban foraging rides tour the best spots to pick berries, mushrooms and fruit within the city limits.Photo: Johannes Romppanen<p><p>By supporting, rather than restricting, people’s activities in the city, policymakers can work together with people to make a difference. For example, when it comes to planning temporary uses for areas such as Kalasatama, the city can benefit greatly from allowing people to experiment with their creativity.<p><p>Such undefined spaces give people more freedom “to take advantage of the changing conditions in the city and create projects that react to the most current situations,” Hernberg says. “Temporary projects are a platform for new experiments, and they can lead to new ideas about more permanent development as well.”<p><p>This kind of thinking really points to Hernberg’s idea of “beyond dreams.” “It’s important to take the time and courage to dream, even to dream the impossible,” she says. “When we go beyond our conventional modes of doing and thinking, it can be possible to make our dreams come true.”<p><p> <p><p>By Henrietta Hautala, August 2012<p><p>City design from the grassroots up<p><p>Realising urban dreams<p><p>Hella Hernberg’s Helsinki Top 5<p>", "time": "2014-06-27T06:32:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

In just four years she has built an ecologically minded brand, Minna, that catches readers’ attention in top fashion mags such as Vogue and Elle.<p><p>Born in Joensuu, eastern Finland, Minna Hepburn moved to London in 1998 after meeting the man who is now her husband. She enrolled in war studies at King’s College London and worked in the banking sector.<p><p>When she graduated and got married in 2003, the newlyweds decided to go backpacking across Asia for four months. The trip marked an important turning point in Hepburn’s life. While travelling, she met people who introduced her to the clothing business, and upon her return to the UK, she started her own shop – without any formal training in fashion.<p><p>Minna Hepburn may be the only fashion designer whose career started with a degree in war studies.Photo: courtesy of Minna<p><p>Minna started out selling clothing in her own boutique at Borough Market and at other London locations, including the clothing chain Topshop. The idea for the Minna brand originated in 2005 when she took time off from work after the birth of her first child. For a year, Minna conducted market research and developed a business plan for her brand.<p><p>While running her first clothing business, she had grown increasingly disturbed by mass production and the short lifespan of high-street clothing. When planning her new business, she decided that her designs would utilise environmentally friendly, sustainable, locally sourced materials. When she discovered Scottish lace produced near Glasgow by local workers, she knew she had found her material.<p><p>In launching her first self-designed Minna collection in 2008, she had to start from scratch. Branding and PR have played an important role from the very beginning. As she explains, it isn’t enough to have a good product – if nobody knows about it, it isn’t going to succeed.<p><p>The Minna brand maintains a strong internet presence through social media and an online store. She truly succeeds in getting people’s attention globally. At the prestigious London Fashion Week her designs have been shown on the Estethica runway, which revolves around ethical fashion production.<p><p>Hepburn’s designs have also been seen on the likes of actress Laura Bailey and Livia Firth, who started the Green Carpet Challenge, aimed at bringing sustainable style to red-carpet events internationally.<p><p>The Tory dress can be worn to a wedding or on other, less formal occasions.Photo: Courtesy of Minna<p><p>Hepburn describes her design as eco luxe, referring to the luxurious quality of her environmentally friendly designs. However, she emphasises that she isn’t an “ecofanatic.” Rather, she is hoping that through her work people will become more aware of the waste of environmental resources and other issues that mass-produced clothing raises.<p><p>According to Hepburn, sustainable fashion shouldn’t just be an elitist “fashion phenomenon,” but something that any fashion-loving person can relate to. She wants her designs to be multifunctional so that even her popular bridal collection pieces can also be worn for occasions other than weddings. The Minna brand aims to capture the imagination of consumers who are determined to buy beautiful clothes that are also durable and ethically sound.<p><p>Though she is marketing her brand internationally and is based in the UK, Hepburn still has strong ties to Finland and is happy about the attention that her work receives in her home country.

Her career mirrored – and presaged – the arrival of modernism. It began with realist village scenes from France and Cornwall in the 1880s and climaxed with haunting, cartoonish self-portraits during the Second World War.<p><p>Schjerfbeck’s international stock has been rising since a milestone New York show two decades ago. Her works have fetched auction prices previously unseen for Finnish artists, such as nearly four million euros for her Dancing Shoes at Sotheby’s in London.<p><p>In 2012, several Finnish museums are saluting her 150th anniversary with exhibitions. The biggest takes place at Helsinki’s Ateneum, while museums in Tammisaari on the south coast and Vaasa on the west coast are also in on the action.<p><p>At Ateneum, the largest-ever Schjerfbeck retrospective features nearly one third of the roughly 1,000 paintings she created during her lifetime. The show also includes work by artists who inspired her. Schjerfbeck paintings influenced by 16th-century Spanish master El Greco will for the first time be shown beside his originals.<p><p>“Of course, Schjerfbeck was influenced by other artists, but their influence is difficult to pinpoint as she filtered her impressions of others’ work and drew her own artistic conclusions,” notes curator Vesa Kiljo of the Provincial Museum of Western Uusimaa, known by its abbreviation, EKTA. It houses a more modest, intimate permanent exhibition on Schjerfbeck in the south-coast town of Tammisaari, where the artist lived between 1918 and 1941.<p><p>Helene Schjerfbeck: Dancing shoes (1939 or 1940), Private collection.

On display are her easel and a rocking chair that features in many of her pictures. Films, photos and letters help to explore Schjerfbeck’s world. Local actor and guide Anne Ingman impersonates Schjerfbeck, and is on hand on July 10, 2012 as the museum celebrates the painter’s birthday with cake and free admission.<p><p>That kind of hoopla would no doubt have horrified Schjerfbeck, described by her neighbours as shy and introverted. The Independent has written of her: “Imagine the life of Frida Kahlo yoked to the eye of Edvard Munch, and you’ll begin to get the measure of this oeuvre.”<p><p>Helene Schjerfbeck paints at her home in Tammisaari in 1937.Photo: H. Holmström FNG/CAA/Coll. Gösta Stenman<p><p>While Schjerfbeck’s life was not as dramatic as Kahlo’s, she too had a tough one. After breaking a hip in a childhood accident, Schjerfbeck became a recluse who walked with a limp and battled illnesses most of her life. She never married, despite one engagement and a long-term unrequited friendship, and spent many years caring for her ill mother – who was Scherfbeck’s other primary model besides herself.<p><p>Schjerfbeck is best known for her self-portraits, shown at EKTA as a row of reproductions of 36 works from 1878 to 1945. “Now that I so seldom have the strength to paint, I’ve started on a self-portrait,” she wrote to a friend in 1921. “This way the model is always available, although it isn’t at all pleasant to see oneself.”<p><p>While her early self-portraits were naturalistic, the last ones are just a few stylised strokes. Some other portraits – such as The Californian and The Gipsy – show eyes downcast or turned away, which can paradoxically reveal a great deal about a subject.<p><p>“She wanted to capture the inner person, not just the exterior,” says Kiljo.<p><p> <p><p>By Wif Stenger, June 2012<p><p>Rediscovering her originality<p><p>Frida Kahlo, Edvard Munch and Schjerfbeck<p>", "time": "2012-06-28T06:28:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The screenings, morning discussions, concerts and other festival events gathered a total of 28,000 visitors in 2018. (The 30th-anniversary edition in 2015 set the record, with an attendance of 30,000.)<p><p>Here’s a taste of what awaits you at a typical Midnight Sun: One recent year the main guests included Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan; Michael Chapman, cinematographer of classics such as Taxi Driver; filmmaker Souleymane Cissé, representing modern African cinema; 2010 Palm d’Or winner Apichatpong Weerasethakul; and award-winning director Tony Palmer.<p><p>The Festival program is always innovative, even surprising, a mix of old classics and rising stars.Photo: Maiju Saari<p><p>The Festival has been drawing crowds since 1986. What is the magic behind the success? It all starts with the Festival program: always innovative, even surprising, a mix of old classics and rising stars. According to project manager Ari Lehtola, this is thanks to the artistic ambitions and high quality criteria of the four professionals who choose the films and invite the special guests: Peter von Bagh, internationally acclaimed director Aki Kaurismäki, Mika Kaurismäki and Timo Malmi.<p><p>Then there’s that inimitable Sodankylä spirit, the unique atmosphere that charms everyone. Lehtola says that the festival concept was not planned – it came naturally. “This festival is all about love for the cinema. The spirit we try to grasp and communicate comes mainly from the way Mr Aki Kaurismäki tells stories.”<p><p>The festival organisation wants to maintain the romantic, nostalgically Finnish atmosphere of the Festival. “We try to create a window to the roots of Finland,” says Lehtola, “to the golden age of Finnish dancehalls with Olavi Virta and Finnish tango, and the structural changes of the Finnish countryside in the 1950s and ’60s. These sources of inspiration help us create a unique brand and an identity to cherish. Being genuine works, and is a value in itself.”<p><p>Down to earth and full of midnight sun – this makes a unique festival atmosphere.Photo: Santeri Happonen<p><p>For an event this big you need some help. Each year nearly 300 volunteers keep Midnight Sun going strong. Food, accommodation and a free entry to the screenings are provided – plus, you get to know a lot of fun people!<p><p>Annu Suvanto, a student from Turku, southwestern Finland, has volunteered five times. “I come back for the films and the people,” she says. “I have made many friends here. Sodankylä is relaxed, free of hierarchies. The staff and the guests mix together quite well. It makes the festival special.”<p><p>Non-Finnish speakers can also volunteer. Franziska Zimmermann from Germany and Raquel Uzal from Spain, both students, came to volunteer as cleaners. “The best thing here is that they show films 24 hours a day,” says Zimmermann. “You can go to a screening whenever you want.” Uzal agrees: “You meet other international people who are crazy enough to come up here to work as cleaners!”<p><p>For many festival goers the journey to Sodankylä is an essential part of the festival experience. Emilia Rüf, a student from Helsinki, has travelled with five of her friends in a 40-year-old Volkswagen minibus for three days and nearly 1,200 kilometres. “It goes only 80 kilometres per hour so we took the smaller roads. We came here the same way last year, probably next year as well.”<p><p>Rüf attends the Festival because it’s so down to earth and full of midnight-sun exoticness. “You lose track of time because you watch films around the clock. This is a perfect place for film fans!”<p><p>By Suvi Tuominen, June 2012, updated August 2018<p><p>Window to the roots of Finland<p><p>Don’t forget to sleep<p>", "time": "2014-10-21T14:53:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "Aku Louhimies: The illusionist of truth - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/aku-louhimies-the-illusionist-of-truth/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Film director Aku Louhimies shows a grimy view of Finland. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea – but he tells thisisFINLAND that his newest work, Naked Harbour, is more about hope than despair.<p><p>The name Aku Louhimies seems to pop up everywhere these days. He’s one of Finland’s most controversial directors, mostly because of his dark depiction of the Finnish society.<p><p>Entitled simply Vuosaari in Finnish, after the eastern Helsinki suburb where the film takes place, Naked Harbour premiered in Finland in February 2012. It follows closely in the footsteps of his award-winning Frozen Land (2005), which the Financial Times referred to as “one of the grimmest and [most] brutally honest portrayals of modern Finland to have hit the screens.”<p><p>The director notes that when Naked Harbour was released, the Finnish ambassador to Norway said, “It portrays all the things about Finland that I would not want to show the rest of the world.” Louhimies laughs at the statement and denies that he only portrays Finland in a bad light, yet he frowns at the idea of acting as an ambassador for his country:<p><p>“I can’t be seen as responsible for my country’s image abroad. I’m driven to portray life as I see it – especially feelings and human relations. Whereas [fellow Finnish director] Aki Kaurismäki’s films are like fairytales, mine are as realistic as possible. I like to call it the illusion of truth.”<p><p>“Naked Harbour” is a film about love, and about longing to be accepted as you are. Mikko Kouki (left) plays Pertti, a disillusioned single father.Photo: First Floor Productions<p><p>Louhimies has a long history of learning to create truthful illusions for people to watch on the big screen. From a very young age he knew he wanted to be a film director; he was fascinated by America and an ardent Charlie Chaplin fan (City Lights forms his favourite).<p><p>Louhimies studied film at Helsinki University of Art and Design and at UCLA in the US. In addition to his seven feature-length films, he has directed several critically acclaimed documentaries and his many TV series have been some of the most watched in the Finnish television history.<p><p>The director’s first features were light-hearted, romantic takes on Helsinki in the summer. But it was only after making more sinister, set-in-the-winter, uncomfortable-to-watch kind of films that he started to gain proper international praise in the art-house scene. “They love Finnish melancholia,” says Louhimies, but adds that he’s not going to limit himself to any one style.<p><p>Crossing the line: Milla (Amanda Pilke) claims she’ll do anything to become famous.Photo: First Floor Productions<p><p>Naked Harbour is a film of “urban love stories that happen to take place in an Eastern Helsinki suburb called Vuosaari,” says Louhimies as he ponders the true meaning of the film. “I love making documentaries, but some issues, such as isolation, racism and sexual abuse, can become too unbearable to show in a real setting. When these stories are written and acted in a fictional form, they become easier to handle, easier to perceive.”<p><p>The movie certainly does have a documentary streak to it. Harshly filmed in claustrophobic settings, much of the action takes place indoors – in a hospital, a gym, saunas of all kinds, flats filled with expensive design items or grubby working-class trappings. We follow the lives of young families and lovers, and their shortcomings – unable to reach one another though connected by the same thirst for love and acceptance.<p><p>“Naked Harbour” takes place in the Eastern Helsinki suburb of Vuosaari.Photo: First Floor Productions<p><p>Writing and planning Naked Harbour took Louhimies and his fellow script-writers Niina Repo and Mikko Kouki (who also acts in it) several years. Although the film shows the flip side of a Western welfare state in all its despair and hopelessness – a society of one-parent families and lonely children – there is hope in the end. After building up a whirlwind of tension, the film dissipates into feelings of forgiveness and new chances – although only in the very last minutes.<p><p>In this regard, the location of the film can be seen as having something to do with the positive ending. Louhimies calls Vuosaari “the future face of Finland, with endless opportunities. After all, it’s a place where more cultures, ethnicities and social layers mix than anywhere else in Finland.”<p><p>Louhimies also takes a very positive view on the non-hierarchical structure of the Finnish society: “Almost all the scenes in Naked Harbour could work whichever way round – a father obsessed with losing weight and imposing it on his teenage son could just as well been a mother. Or the single mother dying from cancer could have been a lonely father. We didn’t specify the ethnic backgrounds of the characters either – that came through the casting.”<p><p>Iiris (Laura Birn) and Make (Deogracias Masomi) love and hate with a passion.Photo: First Floor Productions<p><p>When asked about positive aspects, Louhimies gets very inspired by the idea of a film promoting Finland: “Yes. It could be an action thriller that takes place all over Finland – some sort of spy chase story from Lapland to the archipelago, showing the beauty of the Finnish seasons, nature, the lakes, the sea.<p><p>“But even then the story would be the most important thing – a story is the most powerful way to make an impression on someone. I would never want to make just a travel video. If I made a good story showing the best part of Finland, that would be promotion enough.”<p><p>“I can feel that greater renown for Finnish films is just around the corner,” Louhimies says. “Sweden and Denmark have paved the way for us, as has Aki Kaurismäki, of course.”<p><p>For Louhimies, a personal world breakthrough could take the form of a Hollywood remake of Frozen Land set somewhere like Detroit or Los Angeles. Or it might be an action-packed science thriller based on Risto Isomäki’s doomsday graphic novel The Sands of Sarasvati (Tammi, 2008). Or maybe it will turn out to be another art-house film with snow, saunas and elements of melancholia.

In an exclusive interview with thisisFINLAND, Einojuhani Rautavaara recalls a work considered so inflammatory that it was suppressed during the Cold War.<p><p>Rautavaara, born in 1928 and still actively composing, began writing the music and lyrics for his first opera, Kaivos (The Mine) in Switzerland in 1957. He found his inspiration in an ill-fated miners’ strike that had taken place in Soviet-dominated Hungary.<p><p>In Finland – then walking a tightrope between East and West – the subject matter was considered politically dangerous. A toned-down concert version was broadcast on Finnish television in 1963.<p><p>Then the piece was virtually forgotten until a summer evening in 2008, when conductor Hannu Lintu visited Rautavaara.<p><p>Hannu Lintu conducts the Tampere Philharmonic, bringing the long-forgotten “Kaivos” to life.Photo: Ari Ijäs<p><p>“He mentioned Kaivos and I was like, ‘Sorry, what are you talking about?’” recalls Lintu. “I’d never heard of it. So he started to tell the story of the opera. Hearing that some of the music ended up in his string pieces, I knew it must be damn good.” The two went over it, Rautavaara making some slight revisions, and the tragic work premiered in Tampere in late 2010 with the composer in attendance.<p><p>“That performance made me hope that this 50-year-old work would at last find its way onto an opera stage as well,” says Rautavaara. “It was very frustrating that it was not staged back in the ’60s. That’s the reason why I stopped writing operas until the 1980s.”<p><p>Rautavaara went on to compose four more acclaimed operas. He is also popular for more accessible pieces such as Cantus Arcticus, which incorporates birdsongs he recorded in northern Finland.<p><p>The premiere recording of Kaivos (Ondine Records) spotlights veteran baritone Jorma Hynninen, soprano Johanna Rusanen-Kartano and Estonian tenor Mati Turi, backed by the Tampere Philharmonic. The challenging 75-minute work includes elements of avant-garde serialism, romanticism, folk music and even jazz, which plays on a radio in one scene.<p><p>Einojuhani Rautavaara sits at the piano that occupies a prominent place in his living room.Photo: Ari Korkala/FIMIC<p><p>How did the opera sound to the composer after all these years? “I was surprised to hear that it really was possible to create eloquent, touching music based on 12-tone technique,” he recalls. Also known as dodecaphony, this rigid technique was in vogue in the mid-20th century as part of the serialism movement.<p><p>Rautavaara later abandoned these strict methods in favour of a more melodic, mystical style epitomised by Angel of Light, his seventh symphony. “I realised that serialism, brought to its logical extreme – as I did in my Fourth Symphony in 1962 – produced music which no longer expressed my intuition. Rather, it became more or less mechanical. Even now, though, I often use my own variation of 12-tone technique.”<p><p>Lintu believes the work marks a crucial turning point in Rautavaara’s career. “It’s a key work because he changed his style during the composition of this piece,” says Lintu. “The music is actually quite scary and frightening at the beginning, because it’s so strictly dodecaphonic. Towards the end, he goes in a more romantic direction. On the final pages of this opera, we can actually hear the Rautavaara whom we know.”<p><p>“Something happened to his compositional style during this piece – perhaps something in the text or the story had something to do with his change of style,” says Lintu, hinting at a parallel between the doomed miners’ rejection of totalitarianism and Rautavaara’s rebellion against Central European musical authoritarianism.<p><p>“We’ve found the piece where he switched from very strict modernism to the more romantic direction. It’s an important opera – a missing link in his career.”<p><p>In good spirits: Rautavaara hopes that a full-scale opera production of “Kaivos” may be staged some day.Photo: Sakari Viika<p><p>In 1955, the 90-year-old Jean Sibelius chose Rautavaara as the winner of a Sibelius scholarship to study in the US. The budding composer studied for two years at Juilliard in New York and took a summer course taught by Aaron Copland. After studies in Switzerland and Germany, Rautavaara earned a degree from Helsinki’s Sibelius Academy – where he later taught composition for decades.<p><p>“Rautavaara is an important figure for all of us,” says Lintu. “He has helped young composers, as he himself was helped by Sibelius. He has been very generous. We can always visit him to talk about music. He’s Godfather Number One in Finnish musical life!”<p><p>Rautavaara remains busy, now composing a quintet for New York’s Chamber Music Society. Meanwhile, the Grammies are handed out in Los Angeles on February 12, 2012.

You get acclaimed wines with an exquisite soul and character.<p><p>To find the only Finnish-owned vineyard in France, start in the southwest, about 40 kilometres south of the city of Bordeaux and 2.5 kilometres from the little town of Beguey. At the top of the plateau lies the Château Carsin vineyard, owned by Juha Berglund and his sister Liisa.<p><p>The long road that Berglund chose was one worth taking. Today he is the only internationally known Finnish wine producer; his high-quality wines are sold around the world. Berglund took a bold plunge: He came to Bordeaux in 1990 not knowing the language or local customs, and with almost no experience in wine making.<p><p>“I was supposed to become a violinist, but in life a lot of things happen by accident,” says Berglund. “I have been lucky to be able to do something I love.”<p><p>With customers around the world, Juha Berglund is the only internationally known Finnish wine producer Photo: Amanda Soila<p><p>Berglund’s love affair with wine began for “purely snobbish reasons.” When Berglund’s student friend came back from a trip to Paris and was boasting about how much he knew about wine, Berglund decided to “beat him in wine knowledge.”<p><p>He began blind-tasting wines and guessing their identity. After enough sniffs, swirls and sips, in 1987 Berglund opened Decanter, a shop in the centre of Helsinki specialising in wine products and gadgets.<p><p>A few years later he started publishing Viini, a prestigious wine magazine, now an independent company and the main organiser of Finland’s wine trade fair. He also co-authors Viinistä viiniin (From wine to wine), a yearly wine guide, with his colleague Antti Rintahuumo.<p><p>For about 25,000 euros per hectare, Berglund bought land for his dream. “I wanted to start experimenting on wines and playing around with barrels, so I suggested to two of my sisters that we buy a vineyard in France, preferably Bordeaux. Eventually we found a farm with 14 hectares and nearby, in the village of Rions, we found eight more hectares. In other words, our first vintage in 1990 was the product of 22 hectares of vineyard,” Berglund proudly explains.<p><p>Somewhere under the rainbow: Juha Berglund and his sister Liisa own and operate Château Carsin. Photo: Château Carsin<p><p>At the moment, the Bordeaux region yields roughly 7,000 bottles per hectare. On average, one hectare of vineyard generates a turnover of 20,000 to 50,000 euros.<p><p>For Berglund, the initial emphasis was not on the grapes but on the added value, which came from modern vinification processes in the cellar. When Berglund purchased Château Carsin, he also decided to take a different road from the other Bordelaise wine producers, who are known for their emphasis on tradition.<p><p>“We predicted that the new world would come, and we were right!” For the 1991 vintage Berglund ordered a modern winery using the winemaking techniques of visionary Australian winemaker Brian Croser.<p><p>In 2003 Berglund started experimenting with biodynamic agriculture, and today the vineyard is 100 percent biodynamic. Photo: Château Carsin<p><p>In 2003 Berglund started experimenting on a couple of hectares with biodynamic agriculture, a form of ecological, organic farming. “Even if I don’t understand the whole philosophy of biodynamic methods, the results are very good,” says Berglund. “We use biodynamic methods: we work at certain hours according to the calendar, and we don’t use any pesticides or herbicides. And today we are 100 percent biodynamic!”<p><p>He no longer wants to make a “standardised product.” Today Château Carsin wines are “much higher in quality but they also fetch higher prices.” They do not advertise that their wines form a product of biodynamic viticulture because “it is more important to make good wines than to announce the methods used.”<p><p>At the moment, there are almost 500 biodynamic wine producers worldwide, a number of them high-profile commercial growers.<p><p>Berglund explains how he wants to sell a story with his wine: “When one tastes wine, one expects not only a taste but also a story, a mental experience. We also look for an image, a label, a colour, an aroma. We always talk about wines as people. We call them complex, nervous, fat, thin, open, young. When you drink a wine you drink the spirit of the wine.”<p><p>He says he wants to “get closer to the roots of the wine” while in search of its personality and character. When the only true Finnish wine producer is asked what he is looking for in his wine, Berglund’s answer is blunt. “We are looking for a wine that has more attack, a wine that has more balls.”<p><p>By Carina Chela, October 2011<p><p>Love affair with wine<p><p>A road less travelled<p><p>Going biodynamic<p>", "time": "2014-06-27T08:27:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

They look as if they have walked out of a script for a romantic comedy set in the streets of Paris. They radiate beauty, glamour and confidence, not to mention success. In their case, music is their passion – they are the duo called The Dø, whose first album A Mouthful (2008) reached the top of the sales charts in France, an unusual achievement considering that they sing almost exclusively in English.<p><p>“We devote most of our time to music!” says Merilahti, when she is asked about other interests. “It’s our life,” adds Levy. “On holiday we’re always composing or listening to music, or reading books.”<p><p>With captivating indie pop that is also winning them a mass following in Finland (Merilahti’s mother is Finnish and her father French), the band is facing the challenge of keeping up their standards on their second album, Both Ways Open Jaws, out this year.<p><p>“The pressure comes more from the record companies, which are usually afraid of not selling so many after the success of the first album,” says Levy. “For us it’s not so difficult.

We’re very pleased with the result.”<p><p>Passionate about music: Merilahti and Levy grab their listeners.Photo: Gregg Brehin<p><p>The couple decided to form a band after working together on the soundtrack of the film Empire of the Wolves. It was musical love at first sight. “I think we learn a lot from each other,” says Merilahti. “We complement one another very well. For example, Dan didn’t know much about pop or soul music and I’ve learned things about other styles, like jazz.”<p><p>The two are not afraid of experimenting and rediscovering themselves. A good example of this is the re-release of their second album in October 2011, with six new added tracks recorded during the summer accompanied by other musicians after they learned from their live experiences.<p><p>As Merilahti puts it, “The two of us are used to working alone on our music. We form a good team and we like those dynamics but, as an exception, it has been a fantastic experience working with other musicians.”<p><p>Although The Dø has ties to Finland and France, Merilahti and Levy sing most of their songs in English. Photo: Gregg Brehin<p><p>Inevitably, Finland and its culture and nature also affect the duo’s work. For Merilahti particularly, with the band based in France for most of the year, visits to Finland are particularly emotional: “Let’s say that on one hand I don’t feel completely at home, but on the other hand, I am at home. It’s an important part of my identity. My mother was always very careful to see that I knew Finland and spoke the language, and I am close to my family.”<p><p>Levy praises Finland’s peaceful virtues: “In one way or another, while composing or while playing at concerts and festivals, we’re always surrounded by noise. Sometimes we need silence and we’ve found perfect silence here, in Finland. We come often – the countryside is fantastic. We love spending time at the country house Olivia’s family has near Uusikaupunki. We’ve seriously thought that it might be an ideal environment for recording our next album.”<p><p>And, between relaxed sauna sessions and swimming in the lakes in the Finnish forests, the band keeps going.

At 22 years of age, the carefree air that he exudes is at the same time a very confident one for someone that considers it a privilege just to be on stage: “A few years ago I didn’t even have the money to come to the festival. I use to tell my friends that one day we will come here to play. And look! This year it came true!”<p><p>They give it everything they’ve got at Flow Festival in August 2011.Photo: Antonio Díaz<p><p>In spite of having to play at an early hour, in spite of the organisers opening the doors late and in spite of a guitar not working, French Films manages to make the audience dance and jump as if possessed during a half an hour of scintillating guitar riffs, youthful energy and cool vibes.<p><p>This band has been coming on strong, and with good reason. It is considered by the Finnish trade press to be the most promising band on the scene, a future sales-chart topper. Its members Johannes, Joni, Mikael, Santtu and Antti have already achieved something beyond the reach of many new bands: They are well known only a year after publishing their first EP, Golden Sea.<p><p>“The truth is that internet promotion has helped us a lot,” says Johannes. “Ten years ago this would most probably have been impossible. Now Facebook, MySpace and all the blogs help us. Sometimes fans send us messages commenting that they loved some French movie or other. I am no expert in that field – the name of our band came from a conversation with Joni, our guitarist. But as long as they are fans, anything goes!”<p><p>Looking forward to the future: French Films performs in the Land of the Rising Sun in late 2011.Photo: Flow Festival<p><p>For the time being the band is busy showing the world that French Films refers to more than Godard and Truffaut. The band’s first album, Imaginary Future, appeared in September 2011. They will continue touring Europe and will visit Japan for the first time at the end of the year:<p><p>“I’m excited about our trip to Japan,” says Johannes enthusiastically. “It’s an incredible place and I’ve never been there. It’s fantastic that our music gives us the opportunity to visit places like that.”<p><p>Even though French Films’ music invites you to relax and be transported by the party atmosphere, these Finns have their feet firmly on the ground: “We’d like to thank the public for everything,” Johannes tells the audience. “We hope you enjoy the concert, buy the new album and keep away from fascism because it’s never a good thing!” He shouts out his farewell message with a mischievous smile.<p><p>By Antonio Díaz, September 2011<p><p>A future of films<p><p>Japan on the horizon<p>", "time": "2011-10-03T06:59:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

We’re right on a convenient path between the railway station and the main thoroughfare Mannerheimintie,” she adds.<p><p>The centre’s pleasant café, a small record shop, an exhibition area and open rehearsals should all help to bring casual visitors in. Hiilivirta is also pleased that the centre’s mirror-like glass covering has attracted young skateboarders and street dancers to the surrounding paved areas and lawns, and she hopes they will soon venture inside.<p><p>The main concert hall features a vineyard-style terraced seating layout.Photo courtesy of Music Centre<p><p>The two main aims of the centre’s architects were to create a building in harmony with the surrounding cityscape in the heart of the Finnish capital, and to create an acoustically world-class concert hall – with help from Japanese specialists Nagata Acoustics.<p><p>“We chose proven materials and acoustic structures and a vineyard-style terraced seating layout for the main concert hall with the audience surrounding the orchestra, as in the successful Berlin Philharmonie concert hall, but each hall must have its own unique acoustic design,” explains acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota.<p><p>The microshaped, dark-stained birch panels covering the main concert hall’s walls have been designed to diffuse sound and prevent echoes, while also giving Finnish audiences the subliminal sense of sitting in a giant traditional smoke sauna. The seating arrangement separates the audience into intimate clusters angled towards the light-coloured pine-clad stage, which stands out among the otherwise dark furnishings.<p><p>Toyota proudly describes the hall’s acoustics as clear and rich. “Recordings on media like CDs are so wonderful today, enabling listeners to hear every single note clearly, so it’s frustrating if you don’t get the same experience in concert halls,” he adds.<p><p>In addition to the 1,700-seat main concert hall, the centre includes an underground level with five smaller concert venues and ample space for performers to tune up or chill out.<p><p>The Music Centre forms a cultural centre for everybody, a meeting place in the middle of the city.Photo courtesy of Music Centre<p><p>The centre also provides a new base for the renowned Sibelius Academy, where young elite Finnish musicians learn their trade. “As well as our new teaching classrooms and studios, we’re delighted that the centre will enable our students to interact and collaborate with professional musicians and take part in their master classes,” says the academy’s rector Gustav Djupsjöbacka.<p><p>Highlights of the centre’s opening season include a gala Rachmaninoff concert by Armenian pianist Denis Matsuev with the Helsinki Philharmonic and a show by the unique Finnish rock group Apocalyptica, whose members include cellists trained at the Sibelius Academy.<p><p>Tickets for the autumn’s events are selling out fast with Finnish music-lovers keen to see – and hear – the new €188-million centre for themselves.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela and Fran Weaver, September 2011<p><p>Surrounded by superb sound<p><p>Master classes for budding musicians<p>", "time": "2011-10-06T12:37:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

A musician friend invited him to take a walk to a local beauty spot, Aittakuru Gorge.<p><p>“My friend took his guitar down into the gorge and told me to sit up on the high slopes overlooking it and listen as he played – and the sound was absolutely amazing!” says Valtonen. “The gorge forms a perfect natural amphitheatre, and the jagged rocks on the surrounding scree slopes create acoustics that are as good as any high-tech recording studio.”<p><p>Valtonen instantly realised the gorge would be an ideal venue for an “unplugged” music festival. He spread the word among his connections in the music industry, and the Pyhä Unplugged festival has been held every summer since 1998 on a specially built stage. “When they first come here, artists are often moved to tears by the sheer beauty of the place and its acoustics,” he says. “Though this is a low-budget festival, top artists really enjoy participating – also because they get a chance to work together with other artists in an informal atmosphere.”<p><p>Reaching to the festival stage requires a small hike – no problem unless you’re a roadie carrying unwieldy musical instruments.Photo: Pera Hussi/Lapland Memories<p><p>Valtonen emphasises that everyone who has performed in Pyhä’s gorgeous arena has been keen to come back to “Finland’s nicest music festival” again – though a few roadies may be reluctant to return, since carrying cumbersome instruments along the trails to the stage can be a Herculean task.<p><p>The festival has become one of the cultural highlights of the summer in the Land of the Midnight Sun, without losing its friendly feel. The informal atmosphere enables music lovers to mix with artists, particularly during the late-night indoor sessions in Hotel Pyhätunturi.<p><p>“There’s something so special about the place that it feels almost supernatural,” says Valtonen. “One summer opera singer Maria Palo was performing ‘Singing in the Rain,’ and though the day was sunny with blue skies all around, a large cloud suddenly appeared from nowhere and dropped torrents of rain on everyone in the gorge. With all those huge rocks on the steep slopes around the gorge we’ve banned performances of anything by the Rolling Stones!” he laughs.<p><p>Artists lined up for the 2011 festival include Lenni-Kalle Taipale, Juha Tapio, Paleface, Mariska &amp; Pahat Sudet, Johanna Rusanen, Dave Lindholm, Tuure Kilpeläinen, Edu Kettunen and many more.<p><p>By Fran Weaver, July 2011<p>", "time": "2011-08-09T15:48:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Readers flock to New Finnish Grammar - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/readers-flock-to-new-finnish-grammar/", "review": "", "content": "<p>The newly released English edition of an Italian novel set in Finland is now selling like hot cinnamon rolls.<p><p>Imagine my surprise: Top of the Guardian newspaper’s online bestseller list was a book called New Finnish Grammar. Surely some mistake? How could so many readers be queuing up to discover the perplexing intricacies of the Finnish language? Finland may be attracting plenty of delighted visitors, but how many of them take the trouble to learn more than the basics: kiitos (thank you) and olut (beer)?<p><p>Wartime view of Helsinki: New Finnish Grammar mentions the Soviet bombings of the Finnish capital, which created scenes such as this one in the neighbourhood of Hermanni.Photo: Osvald Hedenström/SA-Kuva/Lehtikuva<p><p>Upon closer examination, it became clear that New Finnish Grammar is in fact a novel, originally written in Italian by Diego Marani and first published in 2000. UK publisher Dedalus released an English version in 2011. Unlike most foreign literature that makes more than a passing reference to the country, the book attracted little attention when its Finnish edition appeared in 2003. The English version, on the other hand, appears to be jumping off the bookshop shelves and acquiring something of a cult status.<p><p>The novel tells of a man found on the quayside in the Italian port of Trieste in the early autumn of 1943. This unidentified character has no memory of previous life or language, but carries a single clue in the from of the nametag on his jacket – Sampo Karjalainen, the Finnish origin of which is recognised by a well-meaning ship’s doctor who has Finnish roots himself.<p><p>In the belief that the man’s best chance of rediscovering his identity lies in the north, passage is arranged to Helsinki where an army chaplain named Olof Koskela gradually fills the blank sheet of Sampo’s memory with vodka-fuelled accounts from the Finnish national epic Kalevala. Meanwhile, Sampo is distracted by the affection of a nurse, whose fraught letters from the Karelian front are increasingly resigned to his inability, emotional as much as linguistic, to reply.<p><p>Cover design by Marie Lane<p><p>The three Italian literary prizes acquired by Marani for this novel are deserved if only for the authentic descriptions of a Helsinki tensed for and battered by war with Russia (the conflict in question being the so-called Continuation War of 1941–1944). From the alternating excitement and boredom of the foreign press corps in the Kämp Hotel to the bloodstained weary troops arriving by train from the front, the trauma of a city at war is convincingly portrayed.<p><p>Marani also deserves kudos for his evident understanding of the Finnish language and his knowledge of the complex Kalevala’s dramatis personae. Marani’s interest in language is not surprising in view of his roles as senior EU linguist and inventor of Europanto, a kind of Europe-only Esperanto, but his empathy with Finnish culture is more than academic.<p><p>New Finnish Grammar offers much more than a thoroughly researched wartime mystery. In a compact narrative that stops just short of 190 pages, it manages to examine the nature of memory, the connection between language and identity, and the relationship between identity, commitment and love, while interpreting Finland’s ancient myths, through Olof Koskela’s descriptions, as deeply philosophical and contemporary.<p><p>Sampo’s name itself is no coincidence: Sampo is the mystical artefact at the heart of the Kalevala, an elusive magic grail, while Karjalainen is the adjective meaning “of Karelia,” referring to the eastern region of Finland, much of which was lost to the Soviet Union at the end of the Continuation War.<p><p>At the same time, rarely can the Finnish language itself have been described so appreciatively by a non-Finn. “Finnish syntax is thorny but delicate: Instead of starting from the centre of things, it surrounds and envelops them from without,” expounds Olof Koskela in one of his tutorials. “As a result, the Finnish sentence is like a cocoon, impenetrable, closed in upon itself; here meaning ripens slowly and then, when ripe, flies off, bright and elusive.”<p><p>The last word should go to the fine translation by Judith Landry. It’s a pity that the publisher made the decision, in a book focusing on language, to do away with the Finnish letters “ä” and “ö” in the English version. [Editor’s note: After reading this article, Dedalus Books contacted us to explain that the English text they originally received did not include the Finnish letters for some reason. This oversight may be corrected in the next edition.] But this is a book worth reading for anyone familiar with Finland – and anyone who’s not.<p><p>By Tim Bird, August 2011<p><p>Authentic setting<p><p>“Bright and elusive”<p><p><p>", "time": "2011-08-05T14:36:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The popular performer (video clip below) tells us about her childhood and how she became aware that such a thing as racism exists.<p><p>When I was in grade six in school, one of our assignments was a project about African countries. It formed part of that new kind of studying – you know, where you work independently instead of someone feeding you facts. I guess most of it was copying bits of various reference books and then making sure to decorate your report really nicely.<p><p>I chose South Africa and Namibia. Something about them made me more enthusiastic than I had been in other projects. I wrote about natural riches, wide-open deserts, chiefs in Amboland and, of course, apartheid. This was back in the days when Namibia had yet to achieve independence and Nelson Mandela was still in prison. I went and saw the film Cry Freedom and shed bitter tears about the injustices it portrayed. I couldn’t understand how such evil could exist in the world.<p><p>Salokoski grew up in a bilingual family speaking both of Finland’s official languages: Finnish and Swedish. Photo: Cata Portin<p><p>At the time, my mother was working as an anthropologist doing Africa-related research. Her colleagues often visited us; some of them were members of SWAPO, Namibian freedom fighters in exile. I remember that one guest made a big impression on me by mimicking an astonishing range of animal calls and cries.<p><p>I think that my contact with these people was what allowed me to empathise so deeply with South Africa’s struggle for freedom. At that time I must have been a bit different than most kids my age. My classmates were dressing in Lacoste shirts and deck shoes and spending most of their time gossiping about the latest party.<p><p>I didn’t really fit in. I had strange ideas and listened to different music. My chatter about supporting justice and opposing racism fell on deaf ears. It just wasn’t cool to preach about colonialism and segregation if you were a nerd and you wore the wrong kind of clothes.<p><p>It got worse as my early teen years progressed. Then the gossip was about the latest punch-up with the Roma down at the railway station. And it wasn’t pretty to listen to. One time a guy came up to me and said, “You probably think it’s racist to dislike the Gypsies.” When I said yes, he let out a burst of disparaging laughter.<p><p>Fights with the Roma were the only multicultural encounters those guys had. They’d never experienced the warmth of meeting people who see the world from a completely different perspective, never been uplifted by the beat of their music, never listened to their stories or seen their pictures.<p><p> <p><p> <p><p>The tone of the public discussion about immigrants lately has got me worried. Worried and confused. I thought racism was a thing of the past. I thought apartheid had been extinguished 20 years ago. But it lives on like a dark cloud, like a smouldering fire under the forest floor.<p><p>Racism exists in us all. Sometimes it flares up and takes on frightening populistic features, and can even become something close to a generally accepted attitude.<p><p>We have to keep alert. It’s natural to fear what is different. That’s why we have to fight to make the unknown familiar. Learn about other people’s customs and, moreover, get to know people who are different. We have to see what is different, but also what is the same: the heart that beats within every single person.<p><p>Maybe we have to leave our comfort zone to see other people’s hearts, but I submit that we will be enriched by doing so.<p><p>A version of this article originally appeared in magazine HelsinginTaidemuseo.fi, issue 2/2010.<p><p>By Emma Salokoski, April 2011<p><p>The warmth of a different perspective<p><p>See the heart within<p>", "time": "2011-06-28T11:19:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Finnish contemporary literature: A wealth of voices - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-contemporary-literature-a-wealth-of-voices/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Bertolt Brecht once noted that Finns are silent in two languages. Maybe so, but they write in three – Finnish, Swedish and Sámi – and the total number of titles published annually in Finland is tremendous. The country sees the publication of 13,000-14,000 books a year, over 4,500 of them new works. Only in Iceland are more books published per capita.<p><p>Finns are also diligent readers, and the country’s extensive network of free libraries is largely to be thanked for this. Free admission to the world of knowledge is the key equalizing principle in cultural policy, and the figures are convincing: an average of over 19 library loans per resident per year. The library institution is vital for authors as well, as the compensation they receive from loans is an essential source of income for many.<p><p>In Finland, reading is a hobby that begins in the home at a young age: according to a study by Statistics Finland, about 70% of parents read out loud to their children. The latest PISA studies award Finnish pupils good results in reading skills, and in addition to the Disney characters known worldwide, favourite literary figures for Finnish children include Tove Jansson’s Moomintroll, who has appeared in just about every corner of the globe, and Ricky Rapper, whose adventures have been made into incredibly popular family films. One more revealing statistic: every third Finn reads literature every month, and this figure has remained stable since 2000.<p><p>E-books form a growing market in Finland. Getting in on the action are publishers, bookstores and even telecoms operators such as Elisa, whose store is shown here.© Elisa<p><p>Although the battle for readers’ free time has escalated – reading, after all, is a time-intensive activity – sales of literature have not notably declined since the turn of the millennium, and according to a 2008 ‘Finland Reads’ study, 16% of Finns buy over ten books a year. The 2010 statistics reveal a distinct, over 10% drop in total sales of literature – the first ever. Nevertheless, the book has maintained its position as a prestigious gift, despite the fact that, as elsewhere, paperback markets have expanded and new works are sometimes available in paperback during their year of release.<p><p>On the other hand, reading groups, social media, and popular blogs on literature have extended the group that critically assesses and recommends books. Although reading is a private experience, there is a desire to share it. In this sense, literature is a broad adhesive surface that binds people together.<p><p>With its e-books and print-on-demand, the current publishing environment has transformed the traditional role of the general-interest publisher. In recent years, Finland has seen the establishment of professionally run small presses that focus primarily on Finnish literature and nonfiction, with some degree of translations. Along with this development and in accordance with international trends, Finland has also seen the founding of its first literary agencies, which sell Finnish authors’ translation rights abroad, an activity that has traditionally been the sphere of publishing houses.<p><p>Translations of Sofi Oksanen’s prize-winning book Purge appear or are forthcoming in nearly 40 different countries. From left: UK, Germany, Sweden, Hungary, Italy and Iceland.<p><p>Furthermore, there has been growth in the sale of these translation rights: currently, approximately 200 Finnish titles appear in translation each year in almost 40 languages. The greatest number of these titles are published in Germany, with Sweden and Estonia following, but there are also, for instance, significant numbers of translations into Japanese. Finland has a broader tip of good literature these days, translator training has been bolstered, and sales efforts have been intensified. A good illustration of this is that FILI, the organisation dedicated to exporting and promoting Finnish literature, is now preparing for Finland’s theme year at the Frankfurt book fair in 2014.<p><p>This FINFO focuses above all on what type of literature is being written at the end of the first decade of the 2000s, and by whom. The new generation of writers, born in the 1970s and ‘80s and raised in an international environment, is gradually solidifying its position. Many of them write flexibly across genre boundaries: poems and prose, for children and adults. Literature by immigrant writers has also started to appear. Despite its uncertainty, the profession of author has traditionally been a respected one, and the system of grants – ranging from six months to five years in duration – is very good.<p><p>The polyphonic voice of contemporary Finnish literature is carrying further than ever.<p><p>Nina Paavolainen<p><p>Left: Aleksis Kivi’s Seven Brothers (1870) is regarded as the first significant novel written in Finnish. Right: The Finnish national epic Kalevala forms the basis for popular children’s book The Canine Kalevala by Mauri Kunnas.<p><p>At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, Finnish literature bears international comparison well in terms of multidimensionality, despite the fact that Finland does not boast a particularly long literary history. National author Aleksis Kivi was the first master of Finnish-language prose, and his output coincided with the postromantic decades following the 1850s, while the Finnish national epic The Kalevala, compiled by Elias Lönnrot, appeared in 1835.<p><p>It should be noted that The Kalevala still holds influence today: even if you’ve never read it, its body of stories and imagery continue to have a powerful effect on the collective Finnish imagination. Comic book artist Mauri Kunnas’ The Canine Kalevala (new edition 2006) and a simplified version of The Kalevala intended for children (2002, English version 2009) remain incredibly popular. The Kalevala has been translated into over 60 languages, and Aleksis Kivi’s best-known work, Seven Brothers, which crystallises the tension between rural and urban, primitiveness and civilisation that has long shaped the core of Finnish identity, continues to be a favourite and benchmark for authors.<p><p>In Finland as elsewhere, the biggest sales figures are achieved by detective novels (Matti Yrjänä Joensuu, Leena Lehtolainen), thrillers (Ilkka Remes), family sagas (Laila Hietamies) and why not chick-lit-influenced portrayals of urban women (Katja Kallio). Also enjoying newfound status as a top-selling genre is the domestic comic book (embodied in such characters as Viivi and Wagner).<p><p>In addition, other quality prose is written in Finland, which in terms of style and subject more and more frequently finds its way across the nation’s borders.<p><p>Finnish literature has always included a powerful historical awareness. In the years of post-war growth and creation of national unity, literature had ideological tasks to fulfil, and up until the 1970s, it contributed to discussions surrounding the construction of the welfare state. Prior to this, Mika Waltari – in whose production novels situated in the past are read as depictions of the societal climate at the time of publication – created the 1945 work The Egyptian, which was translated into dozens of languages. Its status as a classic is by and large founded on its fundamental humanism, and Waltari remains among Finland’s best-known authors abroad.<p><p><p><p>Sofi Oksanen’s Purge (2008), one of Finland’s biggest international breakthroughs in recent years, revitalises the historical novel. Its Estonian-Finnish framework, fixed against a backdrop of recent European history, has spoken to readers as far away as the US, and in Finland alone the book has sold over 160,000 copies.<p><p>The popularity of Purge can be explained through a variety of factors. It takes a bold approach to the recent history of Finland’s sister nation, and its interpretations of the events of the Second World War, the relationship between the conqueror and the conquered, have generated much debate. The heroes end up turning into the losers, and during wartime everyone loses something, not least of all themselves.<p><p>Oksanen’s narration is not anchored in the tradition of realism; it is carried along by a profuse flow of lush and lingering verbs. The strong female perspective opens up a view to a mental landscape whose experiences have not received equal exposure. It gives a voice to a muzzled distress that no one has wanted to hear, and this is likely one reason why the work has tapped into such a broad base of identification. The story of three generations of women fleshes out the themes of nationalism and femaleness: women’s bodies and women’s work are both concretely and metaphorically instruments of warfare in which subjugation, humiliation, and shame are ever-present.<p><p>Sofi OksanenPhoto: Toni Härkönen<p><p>Furthermore, Sofi Oksanen represents the younger generation of writers in that she is happy to meet her readers, travels abroad continuously to speak about her work and raises topics of current interest when she makes an appearance. The media continues to write more about writers as phenomena rather than literature itself, but shifts in the publishing field and seemingly dramatic changes of publisher feed this orientation as well.<p><p>Examples also exist from recent years of the historical novel’s fragmentation to deal more problematically with the construction of Finnish identity over the last century. A fine illustration of its expansion into the mental-historical arena is Jari Järvelä’s trilogy, whose final segment has been appropriately named Kansallismaisema (‘The National Landscape,’ 2006). As old as his century, in other words 38 years old in 1938, the protagonist takes centre stage as the author carefully describes the painful birth of a common culture.<p><p>Jari Tervo, who has long belonged to the first tier of Finnish authors, frequently and very amusingly portrays ‘the common folk,’ particularly the people of northern Finland. His works that appeared in the years leading up to the 2010s, a trilogy that deals with Finnish history, do not form a chronologically linear whole: we begin from the Cold War era and end in 1920, in the period following the Finnish Civil War. Instead, it re-draws key turning points from the nation’s recent past, which in Tervo’s interpretation are linked by the fight against communism.<p><p>Leena Parkkinen’s strong debut Sinun jälkeesi, Max (‘After You, Max,’ 2009) resurrects the past milieu of 1920s Helsinki, but its broader framework is the European worldview and its questions universal. Siamese twins and circus performers Max and Isaac tour Europe, embodying the thematics of difference and otherness: How is it possible to live separately and yet forever side by side?<p><p>Nina Paavolainen<p><p>In searching for a common denominator in Finnish literature from recent years, we strike upon a distinct openness among Finland’s younger mid-generation prosaists to reaching beyond the borders of Finland, and an effortless movement from one country and culture to the next. Control of form versus content is also stronger.<p><p><p><p>The western Estonian landscapes of Oksanen’s Purge shift to sub-Saharan Africa In Elina Hirvonen’s second novel Kauimpana kuolemasta(‘Furthest from Death,’ 2010). In this work, Paul, a Finn, and Esther, an African, take turns as the first-person narrator.<p><p>Katri Lipson’s Kosmonautti (’Cosmonaut,’ 2008) is set in 1980s Murmansk, another geographically and culturally distant locale. A schoolboy from a seedy Soviet suburb who is passionately in love with his teacher dreams of a future as a cosmonaut. Lipson’s prose lingers in the space between events and at the boundaries of human encounters with an exceedingly sure hand, and its forebears can be sought first and foremost in the Russian classics.<p><p>Kristina Carlson’s Herra Darwinin puutarhuri (’Mr Darwin’s Gardener,’ 2009) gravitates geographically to England and deals with ideological-historical themes of the 19th century. The main character is Charles Darwin’s gardener, and the life of the small village community is reflected through the perspectives of the book’s various subjects. Carlson’s work transplants the great questions of modern man to a Kentish kitchen garden.<p><p>Miika Nousiainen adds a tragicomic spin to our problematic relationship with our western neighbours in his book Vadelmavenepakolainen (’Raspberry Boat Refugee,’ 2007), whose protagonist is completely obsessed with becoming Swedish. Liberating laughter makes the obsession feel like nothing more than a twisted whim. The versatile Johanna Sinisalo’sBirdbrain (2008) pits a young couple against the forces of nature in New Zealand, whereas Leena Krohn’s entire crystalline oeuvre approaches philosophical essayistics.<p><p>It’s wonderful that the voices of immigrants are starting gradually to be heard and that the Finnish experience is growing more diverse. Writing competitions have traditionally been popular in Finland, as a way of winnowing out new talents for the publishers’ publishing programmes. 27 eli kuolema tekee taiteilijan (’27, or Death Makes the Artist,’ 2010) is a strong debut from the Slovakian writer Alexandra Salmela, one of the prize-winners from the What on Earth is a New Finn? writing contest. The work is not an immigrant novel per se, yet it offers a fresh perspective on contemporary Finnish culture.<p><p>The main character is Angie, a young art student from Prague, who is anxious to achieve stardom before her 28th birthday – after all, all of her idols from Jimi Hendrix on have died at 27. With the assistance of her professor, she travels to the Finnish countryside and meets all manner of wayfarers. The strengths of Salmela’s work are her masterful control of shifting registers and styles – seasoned with irony that pokes fun at everyone equally. The family’s youngest child’s stuffed pig also lends its voice to the commentary!<p><p>One of the characters in Alexandra Salmela’s novel is a mother who wants to be the perfect enlightened woman and mother, with at-times tragicomic results. In recent years, depictions of family, everyday life, and gender roles have become more diverse in the hands of both female and male authors. These themes are linked to societal changes: the global economic recession, the stress on economic values in the greater societal debates, the increasing inequality of Finnish society, and the splintering values of our post-industrial world are all reflected in recent prose. For years, Pirkko Saisio has been one of the country’s premier literary commentators; her most recent novel, analysing contemporary Finland, is fittingly named Kohtuuttomuus(’Excess,’ 2008). And Anja Snellman, always sensitive to registering timely issues, has written about young Muslim women in Finland (Parvekejumalat, ’Balcony Gods,’ 2010).<p><p><p><p>Kari Hotakainen’s Juoksuhaudantie (’Trench Road,’ 2002) tells about a husband who, after being left by his family, decides to remodel his house, the veteran-built variety that symbolises a certain stoic masculinity, to get them back. He has done everything at home to please his wife and is at a complete loss. The setup is quintessentially Finnish: a man grits his teeth and undertakes, contrary to all voices of reason, to solve his marriage crisis through action. Hugely successful in Finland, the novel received the Nordic Council’s Literature Prize and was also made into a movie.Ihmisen osa (‘The Human Lot,’ 2009) portrays the downside of career- and status-focused ambition with Hotakainen’s characteristic laconic humour, and once again the woman and mother is often the ultimate fount of common sense.<p><p>Riikka Pulkkinen’s Totta (’True,’ 2010) is a structurally skilfully composed artistic novel in which the portrayal of the family is partially anchored in a depiction of the era of the 1960s. A grandmother and wife whose modern dedication to her career has been consistent from the start emerges as one of the novel’s main characters. Others have adapted to her ambition, and its effects on the family dynamics are deeper than she could have ever guessed. A nanny from the countryside who joins the family embodies the gap between rural and urban, which has only really been mediated by the boom generation born in the cities of the 1960s. Although a love triangle lies at the heart of the work, Pulkkinen at the same time hones in on the social ruptures of recent decades.<p><p>Mikko RimminenPhoto: Heini Lehväslaiho<p><p>One of the most heart-wrenching depictions of a middle-aged woman is Mikko Rimminen’sNenäpäivä (’Red Nose Day,’ 2010), a big success, in terms of sales and otherwise, the year it appeared. The main character is Irma, who, seeking companionship and friends, decides to masquerade as an interviewer conducting market research. Irma can be seen as a typical Finn who thinks more than she talks and whose shyness feels almost like rudeness. Yet Irma is the universal modern human: confused and lonely, groping for contact with others. Rimminen belongs to that generation of writers for whom the Finnish language is not simply a tool but itself an essential object of reflection: he originally debuted as a poet.<p><p>Markus Nummi’s Karkkipäivä (’Candy Day,’ 2010) is a depiction of a horrifying social case that results in the suffering of little girl. In this work, an overly highly-strung woman is the victim of her own ambitions. A central role in Nummi’s work is played by a young father and screenwriter baffled by his role both at work and at home. Uncertainty about others’ expectations drives him to near-paralysis.<p><p>Nina Paavolainen<p><p>Brothers Touko (front left) and Aleksi (front right) Siltala of Siltala Publishing pose with some of their authors: Pirkko Saisio, Leena Lander, Kari Hotakainen and Hannu Raittila.Photo: Laura Malmivaara<p><p>In 2008, the brothers Touko and Aleksi Siltala founded Siltala Publishing, which publishes about 25 titles a year: slightly over half is literature and the remainder nonfiction, with about a quarter of all titles translations into Finnish. Both men have decades of experience in the publishing industry and agreed to respond to some questions about general developments in the field.<p><p>Nina Paavolainen: How have readers’ tastes changed? Is Finnish literature more popular than translated literature?<p><p>Touko Siltala: The situation has actually changed quite a lot over two decades. Total annual sales of books has remained more or less stable, but there used to be more room for translated literature. Translations of quality literature are read less often nowadays. Sales are steered more by publicity than literary criticism, and the fact that Finnish authors are of interest to the media and receive lots of exposure ends up having a significant effect on sales. Women’s and other periodicals do big pieces on authors.<p><p>Aleksi Siltala: These days, a lot of Finnish books are also made into movies, and they’re optioned quickly. That could also play a partial role in the interest in Finnish authors.<p><p>NP: What kind of nonfiction is published in Finland? What sells?<p><p>AS: Finns have always been interested in political history, especially the history of Finland and the surrounding region, as Sofi Oksanen’s success demonstrates. There appears to be a pretty solid group of readers interested in such topics. A lot of young people aren’t familiar with the Soviet Union, and they’re fascinated by the Cold War era. Many of the notable figures of the previous century, such as Finland’s long-term president Urho Kekkonen and marshal Mannerheim, continue to generate enthusiasm. On the other hand, I would say that earlier periods of Finnish history are reaching readers better, too. In addition, perspectives are gradually broadening; for instance, nonfiction works on China are on the rise.<p><p>NP: In recent years, a large number of authors have switched publishers. Allegiance to one’s publisher used to be, for all practical purposes, absolute. Does this say more about changes in the publishing field or about a shift in attitudes among authors?<p><p>TS: Authors born in the 1960s and ‘70s have a totally different concept of the relationship between author and publisher. Of course they’re still interested in a competent editor, but they want well-planned marketing and communications, too. The sale of foreign rights is an issue as well, but direct and immediate contact is the most important thing. Authors who debuted in the 1970s, for instance, had a completely different take on the matter: the relationship between publisher and writer was like a marriage, which for the most part meant being taken care of and getting sufficiently large advances. The fact that these days an author may have several publishers is a good thing. Independence is a positive thing for artists.<p><p>AS: Being accessible and present is important. Many authors want their publisher to act like a boutique publisher, where you get good service and answers and decisions rapidly.<p><p>NP: You two also have decades of experience with international book fairs and the international publishing field. Does it seem to you that interest in Finnish literature has grown?<p><p>TS: It has grown significantly. Finnish success stories, such as Arto Paasilinna and now Oksanen, have of course cleared the way, but the Nordic countries as a geographical area are also better known now. Foreign colleagues pick your brain for tips on Finnish literature, ask for new names and grill you for your opinions on prize-winners – this never used to happen. Now it feels completely realistic for a Finnish writer to be a really hot name.<p><p>AS: These days, as soon as you’ve covered what’s new at a fair, a foreign publisher might ask about Finnish authors in all seriousness. The interest is genuine, and it has grown wildly in recent years. The success of Nordic detective novels has sucked everyone else along in its wake.<p><p>Nina Paavolainen<p><p>Volumes of vital verses: Two hundred books of poetry are published each year in Finland.<p><p>At this particular moment, the most delightful domain of contemporary Finnish literature is our rich and vital poetry. For a language area of our size, almost two hundred works of poetry a year is an exceptional number of volumes. Important collections are published by small presses and various poetry collectives, as well as by established publishing houses. In addition, book-on-demand technologies and digital environments in general have made it economically feasible to produce poetry collections, specifically those of a collaborative nature.<p><p>In terms of their linguistic roots, Finns are a poetry people, and vaguely melancholic song is a classic self-portrait of Finnish self-expression. The Kalevala-style folk poetry still sung in cottages in the early 19th century is by no means a far-fetched forebear for many of the collaborative forms adopted in contemporary poetry. The rigidly formal evening recitals of the early decades of the 20th century have, in a hundred years, transformed into poetry sessions popular especially among the young: jams at which stage poetry – spoken, sung, or presented via multimedia – is seen and heard.<p><p>Poets also tour the country, presenting their poems themselves: for instance, Heli Laaksonen, who writes in the Laitila dialect, always attracts enormous audiences at her appearances, in addition to achieving print runs of up into the tens of thousands.<p><p>Television has picked up on poetry as well: a popular show called Runoraati (‘The Poetry Panel’) has held onto its programming slot for years. The format of the program is as Finnish as could be and completely unique. Poets present their freshest texts through well-produced poetry videos, and a changing panel of nonprofessional judges analyses and playfully awards points to what they see and hear. It’s almost impossible to come up with a better way introducing broad audiences to new works of low-circulation literature.<p><p>The poetry boom of the 21st century offers a fascinating glimpse into how the field of poetry has remained a home base for younger generations of Finnish writers and readers. It is also, in a way, the ‘introductory genre’ to getting published, the genre in which younger – these days, those born in the 1980s – authors often debut. Later they may pick up other genres as well, and it is common for Finnish authors of different generations to be concurrently publishing both prose and poetry.<p><p>The genres of contemporary poetry reveal how those most actively involved in its creation – those born in the 1970s and ‘80s – represent a generation that has been immersed in information technology. Various internet-facilitated methods and digital platforms are used as the basis for creating poetry, and the concept of found objects, familiar from the visual arts, is realized, for instance, through the use of search engines. Browsers gather material from the world of online speech and language for the poet to work with. The poets Henriikka Tavi, Teemu Manninen, and Harry Salmenniemi, for example, have all demonstrated this type of interest in the materiality of language.<p><p>It’s clear that many modernist conceptions about poetry have been hard pressed in the hands of 21st-century artists. As a matter of fact, the younger generation of the 1990s had already made a pronounced departure from the pure modernism of the 1950s: Helena Sinervo, Jyrki Kiiskinen, Jukka Koskelainen, Tomi Kontio and Riina Katajavuori forcefully foregrounded efforts in contemporary poetry to challenge the modernist tradition and its form, imagery, and notions of subject. Their generation also demonstrated a clear attempt to write out poetic concepts explicitly for debate, as well as to bring about the mutually supportive communities in which the youngest generation of poets now works.<p><p>Today, in the 21st century, most debate takes place online. High-quality literary journals are published in Finland, but there is no question that the most interesting discussions, those most eagerly seeking newness, can be read in the blogs of various writers and critics, the best of which embody demanding essayistics in terms of substance.<p><p>Saila SusiluotoPhoto: Pekka Holmström<p><p>American-influenced language poetry and post-structuralism have acted as an inspiration for many poets of the youngest generation. Yet many of the young poets of the 21st century continue to approach modernist expression through new perspectives, and at this moment the poetry field is dominated by a positive fragmentation and the spirited debate this entails.<p><p>Language is not thus, the only ‘theme’ of poetry; many of the issues of the postmodern world and lifestyle, from the individual perspective, emerge in poetic works. For instance, the pervasiveness of contemporary visual culture has been a motif in the poems of Eino Santanen: in his works, he has critically examined the way in which the media and advertising language have established themselves as a direct continuation of our senses.<p><p>An interesting perspective on 21st-century poetry also opens up from the poetry written by young women, whose relation to their own biological sex and, for instance, motherhood is seen, in contrast to the traditions of women’s history, through affirmation. As late as the 1980s, representations of women in Finnish literature were full of the biological burden and grievances of the second sex, but today Saila Susiluoto, Johanna Venho, Vilja-Tuulia Huotarinen and Juuli Niemi write about being a girl and a woman boosted by a strong female identity. The title of one of Huotarinen’s collections, Iloisen lehmän runot (‘Happy cow poems,’ 2009), reveals that 21st century Finnish poetry resounds with the laughter of women as well.<p><p>Mervi Kantokorpi<p><p>Eco-terrorism in Helsinki figures in Johanna Holmström’s Camera Obscura, while Monika Fagerholm’s Glitterscenen (The Glitter Scene, right) is a follow-up to The American Girl (centre). Fagerholm is one of Finland’s most translated authors.<p><p>Literature written in Swedish within Finland has a life of its own: only a small proportion of the 200 or so books published each year are translated into Finnish, and even fewer find their way into bookshops in Sweden. Literary fiction is published by a handful of publishers, while non-fiction has more outlets, both through professional publishing companies and highly localised organisations.<p><p>Literature written for a market of approximately 300,000 people is only in very rare cases commercially viable, which means that publishers are dependent on the sale of educational materials and on the financial support of various private foundations that between them have access to capital far in excess of that available to the Nobel Foundation.<p><p>The use of these funds to support literature written by and for a minority goes unquestioned: literature, together with Swedish-language radio and television and a large number of daily newspapers, is an important means of both protecting and developing the language that is the cement holding the minority together. This is one way of describing a small literary culture in sociological terms.<p><p>But there must also be other factors that enable it to retain its vitality. It has to have some sort of aura, a sense of self-awareness that makes it an attractive vehicle for the artistic ambitions of new generations. What follows is intended to give an outline of just some of the recurring characteristics that differentiate Finland-Swedish literature from the mainstream literature of both Sweden and Finland.<p><p>Hannele Mikaela TaivassaloPhoto: Cata Portin<p><p>Many people believe that the 1910s and 1920s were the golden age of Finland-Swedish literature, inspired by the experimental mood elsewhere in eastern Europe. The multilingual Edith Södergran, raised in cosmopolitan St Petersburg in the early years of the twentieth century, introduced passionate, Nietzschean poetry that eschewed rigid formality.<p><p>At the same time, she also introduced androgyny: ‘I am a neuter, a page, a bold resolve’, a declaration that continues to echo through the young women writers of the twenty-first century. In her novel Diva (1998), Monika Fagerholm introduced an updated and boldly boundary-transgressing young female character into Finland-Swedish literature, depicting a girl who actively pursues her own interests and refuses to be bowed by convention.<p><p>Similarly bold young women can be found, for instance, in the work of Hannele Mikaela Taivassalo (Fem knivar hade Andrei Krapl / The Five Knives of Andrei Krapl, 2007), Catharina Gripenberg (På diabilden är huvudet proppfullt av lycka / On the Transparency My Head is Completely Full of Happiness, 1999, and Ta min hand, det vore underligt / Take My Hand, It Would Be Strange, 2007), Eva-Stina Byggmästar (the ‘Happiness Trilogy’, 1992-97), Ulrika Nielsen (Mellan Linn Sand / Between Linn Sand, 2006,) and Mikaela Strömberg (De vackra kusinerna / The Beautiful Cousins, 2008).<p><p>Another characteristic shared by these books is that their form, whether narrative or poetry, is aesthetically driven: traces of realism are rare, cause and effect remain unexplained, and different time periods glide into each other. They also share an almost impudently curious attitude.<p><p>Reading these books is like being immersed in self-contained worlds, with their own laws, where deep-felt emotion is woven into the texts, and which manage the rare accomplishment of arousing strong feelings in their readers.<p><p>Kjell WestöFinnish literature goes further than ever<p><p>Although there is a strongly expressive, emotional tradition running through the whole of modern Finland-Swedish literature, there is simultaneously also a striking absence of the established formats for emotionally charged literature.<p><p>Finland-Swedish literature rarely deals with murder, sex or love, common themes in literature the world over. There is very little crime-fiction in Finland’s Swedish-language literature, and sex scenes appear approximately once a decade. Even the traditional love-story and romantic fiction have failed to become established formats.<p><p>It is therefore hardly surprising that in 2011 one of the two big Finland-Swedish publishing houses announced a novel-writing competition in which they are specifically looking for novels with ‘intrigue’, and that a senior editor has gently pointed out in an interview that a novel is more than a linguistically intricate work of art, and that it is no bad thing if it also contains an enticing plot.<p><p>To put it rather more bluntly: the publishers need authors who can write books that merit large print-runs, because very few Finland-Swedish authors can be counted as bestsellers. The only author of the past few decades who has regularly delighted both critics and the book-buying public is Kjell Westö (b. 1961). It isn’t hard to see why: he sticks close to reality, creates long narrative arcs with interwoven tensions between characters, and he has a unique voice which helps his readers stay faithful from book to book.<p><p>For a great many readers he has become a highly appreciated chronicler of the changing face of Helsinki throughout the 20th century. Two other writers who have consistently succeeded in appealing to both critics and readers over many years are Ulla-Lena Lundberg and Lars Sund. They have both turned to the early twentieth century for points of tension in the development of society, as well as providing compelling characters for their readers to care about.<p><p>These three, together with Monika Fagerholm, are among the authors who would attract readers in any country. Monika Fagerholm is the first Finland-Swedish author to be awarded the prestigious August Prize in Sweden, and also the first to have been recommended by Oprah Winfrey. She is one of the most translated authors in contemporary Finland-Swedish literature.<p><p>At the start of the 2010s a new phenomenon is beginning to define itself: a form of text that blends experimentation with realism.<p><p>Some of the authors of the younger generation have started to create hybrid forms in which strict realism suddenly and unexpectedly opens out to encompass supernatural phenomena. The romance of Gothic horror, medieval creatures and spectres have been appearing in student flats, city apartments and cruise ships.<p><p>One of the strongest young voices belongs to Johanna Holmström, who, in her collection of linked short stories, Camera Obscura (2009), depicts young eco-terrorists in Helsinki, but allows the narrative to glide into obsessions that become almost archaic tropes: the wolf is a recurring motif, the beast that is dangerously and painfully attractive. Stefan Nyman’s debut novel, Anna är online (Anna is Online, 2008), also provides a realistic depiction of student life and young relationships, while black crows are portents of Edgar Allan Poe’s menagerie of horrors, or perhaps the limitless fears of a fragile mind.<p><p>Similar cracks between a comprehensible reality and a world tinted by messages from beyond the rational sphere can be found in the relatively small number of authors writing for younger readers in recent decades. Henrika Andersson (b. 1965) and Maria Turtschaninoff (b. 1977) have both used their books to show how different realities can affect each other. An inexplicable world speaks to the young protagonists, reflecting reality through figures drawn from a long history of folklore.<p><p>These books are perhaps reflections of the global boom in fantasy literature, but they also feel like natural successors to Tove Jansson’s tales from Moomin Valley and the gentle stories of grande dame Irmelin Sandman Lilius, where low-key characters in small towns set in an unspecified period experience astonishing things.<p><p>Realism is certainly not a word that can be applied to Finland-Swedish fiction – but perhaps that is the paradoxical strength of this minority literature: it creates its own worlds, worlds that are universal and deeply loved by a secret fan-club with members stretching from Uruguay to Japan.<p><p>Maria Antas, project manager and critic<p><p>Association of Finnish Non-Fiction Writers Books from Finland Booksellers Association of Finland FILI – Finnish Literature Exchange Finnish Book Publishers Association Finnish Institute for Children’s Literature Finnish Literature Society Finnish Whodunnit Society Helsinki City Library Lahti International Writers’ Reunion Modern Finnish Writers National Biography of Finland Swedish Literature Society in Finland Union of Finnish Writers Society of Swedish Authors in Finland (In Swedish)<p><p>Finnish literature goes further than ever<p><p>On Finnish prose<p><p>Out Into the World<p><p>Publishing in Finland in the 21st century<p><p>Finnish poetry in the 21st century<p><p>Finland-Swedish literature<p><p>Selection of literary links<p><p>The Historical Novel<p><p>Family, Everyday Life, and Gender<p><p>The joyous experiment<p><p>An absence of crime and love<p><p>A life alongside reality<p>", "time": "2014-06-27T08:43:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

Finland has had success in this department, recently reaching all over the world with the animated film Niko and the Way to the Stars, about a young reindeer’s search for his father.<p><p>But there are other ways to do a Christmas movie.<p><p>That’s what director Jalmari Helander had in mind. His Rare Exports is guaranteed to rattle Christmas decorations and burst through the kitsch by revealing the “true” nature of Santa Claus – and we must warn you that it’s not for the faint of heart, and it’s definitely not kids’ stuff.<p><p>In Helander’s film a huge, monstrous Santa slumbers, frozen, inside Korvatunturi, a mountain in Finnish Lapland. He’s protected by an army of ancient but violent elves. A boy named Pietari and his father – who just happens to be a butcher – find themselves at the centre of a surreal chain of events. They uncover the plans of the vile elves, and the magic of Christmas builds towards an explosive conclusion.<p><p>Photo: Cinet<p><p>However, Rare Exports is not anti-Christmas. It simply represents a Christmas movie of a different genre. Instead of following Disney, or even Dickens, Helander finds inspiration in zombie movies, blood-splattered chainsaws à la Tobe Hooper, and the gothic moods of Tim Burton.<p><p>Rare Exports pokes fun at sugar-sweet Christmas clichés, viewing them through a lense of parody and black humour. Nonetheless, the underlying story lends a certain harmony and warmth to the film: Pietari grows and prevails through frightening challenges to emerge victorious and win the approval of his father.<p><p>This is a movie that demands more from viewers than your average mainstream flick. That could work to its advantage in our world of subcultures and varied tastes. Festival audiences gave a warm reception to the short film Rare Exports Inc, which was released in 2003 and formed the seed of the current feature-length movie.<p><p>According to Jay Weissberg of Variety magazine, “The sheer fun of classic kids’ adventure movies is perfectly captured and slightly lampooned in the deliciously winning Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale. Conceived with winking humor and a terrific visual style, the pic is a rare treat that could accrue cult status on screens followed by [big] ancillary [sales].”<p><p>Photo: Mika Orasmaa/Cinet<p><p>The film takes place in the Far North, and at first glance it would seem there’s nothing unusual about the remote location, the winter darkness, the men of few words and the stilted English lines sprinkled into the script. Elements such as these are familiar from famous Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki’s work. Yet here they all add up to something quite different. Exaggeration and stylisation turn into a postmodern ability to laugh at oneself – actually, despite the remote setting, the atmosphere seems pretty urban and contains echoes of modern pop culture.<p><p>With tongue firmly in cheek, you could even claim that Rare Exports actually promotes Finland to the rest of the world. It shows how Finns find functional solutions to the trickiest of challenges posed by Mother Nature and, beyond that, by myth-enshrouded figures – and how Finns combine it all into a well-made, entertaining movie.<p><p>By Harri Kilpi, December 2010<p><p>Zombie movies and gothic moods<p><p>Finns find solutions<p>", "time": "2010-12-02T13:32:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

{"title": "Steel, glass, wood and Kalevala spirit - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/steel-glass-wood-and-kalevala-spirit/", "review": "", "content": "<p>“Is there a deep mythology I can get into while I’m there?” asked American architect Travis Price prior to visiting Finland in early 2009. The question eventually gave rise to a unique new building to kick off Helsinki Design Week 2010.<p><p>Price was coming to Finland to get a “live” view of work by architectural greats Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto, and to check out the world of Finnish design. When he brought up mythology, he says he immediately received a flood of email, all pointing to the Finnish national epic Kalevala.<p><p>He chose the Kalevala, a collection of eastern Finnish oral-tradition stories first compiled on paper in the 1800s, as the object and subject of one of his Spirit of Place projects. During its 17-year history, Spirit of Place has used architecture as a medium for exploring mythologies, ecologies and modernism in countries from Canada to Peru and from Uganda to Ireland.<p><p>Kalevalakehto’s wood, glass and metal look right at home on the shores of Seurasaari, surrounded by ocean, forest, stone and sky.Photo: Travis L. Price, FAIA<p><p>Price mentored an international group of architecture students as they went through a range of ideas and models before arriving at a design that would later be built on the Helsinki island park of Seurasaari and named Kalevalakehto.<p><p>But before we explain the moniker, a bit more about the construction itself: Kalevalakehto holds about 15 people and forms a venue for meetings or meditation. More than 30 people helped build it in “a massive effort over ten days in August 2010,” says Price. “Our worst construction accidents were bee stings.”<p><p>While symbolically connected with the Kalevala in many ways, Kalevalakehto’s combination of wood, steel and glass and waterside location can also be appreciated without knowing about themes such as the birth of the world, the mysteries of the Sampo or the character Väinämöinen.<p><p>Meetings or meditation: Kalevalakehto’s design and the way it reflects its surroundings make it a peaceful and inviting setting.Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>The name of the building officially appears in English as “Kalevalakehto: Shaman’s Haven of the Kalevala.” You won’t find Kalevalakehto in your Finnish-English dictionary, though.<p><p>“I’m proud to say that, though I can’t speak Finnish, we’ve invented a new Finnish word,” says Price with a smile. The segment kehto signifies a cradle or protected space, and so the symbolism thickens, verbally as well as visually.<p><p>Kalevalakehto is right at home on Seurasaari, which also contains an open-air museum of historically important buildings from all over Finland. Price says he’s impressed with the Finns’ ability to “leave nature alone but also build in it.”<p><p>Very little of the landscape was disturbed to place Kalevalakehto on a rock surface near the shore, and the building fits perfectly into its environment. Water and forest are reflected in the metal and glass. As Price puts it, “You see the sea, and the water becomes the sky in the ceiling above. That’s the magic we wanted to achieve – thank you, Väinämöinen.”<p><p>The Spirit of Design project on Seurasaari marked the opening of Helsinki Design Week 2010 by hosting a celebration. “Hollywood couldn’t have done it better,” Price recalls. “It rained on everyone, and then bam! The sun came out and bounced on the steel.”<p><p>Kalevalakehto “is alive,” he says, meaning that the wood is still settling. “Every two months someone has to come and adjust the bolts with a lot of love.” The unique structure looks set to stick around for a long time to come, although its current temporary permit runs out in 2013. “The Eiffel Tower is still on a temporary permit,” Price claims. And Eiffel probably didn’t even know anything about the Kalevala. <p><p>By Peter Marten, September 2010<p><p>Meditation and massive effort<p><p>The water becomes the sky<p><p>Bouncing on steel<p>", "time": "2010-09-17T12:46:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

If you hang around the festival any year, you’ll see Mauno Järvelä walking by the main arena, carrying a violin case. Along the way he stops to chat with acquaintances and friends.<p><p>Mauno Järvelä, cofounder of the internationally acclaimed folk group JPP, seems to be in his element in the midst of the festival atmosphere.<p><p>“When the first real folk festival was held in 1968 I was still a youngster, but I started playing as soon as my arms reached the length of a violin,” says Järvelä. “In the 1950s, there were no small violins available in Kaustinen, so you didn’t get to play as a kid. When there were weddings in the summertime, I always sat on the edge of the stage carefully listening as the master musicians played.”<p><p>In a way, Järvelä’s memories reveal the basis of his life’s work. One of his greatest accomplishments of his life has been inspiring large groups of children to play music and sing together as part of the Näppärit (“pluckers”) groups.<p><p>There have been folk musicians in Kaustinen for more than 200 years. Over the past decade, the area has sent an exceptional number of professional musicians out into the world, at first wind instrument players and church cantors, and more recently string players.<p><p>“The Folk Music Festival was preceded by many other festivals that featured Kaustinen folk musicians and professionals who got their start here,” says Järvelä. “At these events, the folk players got a new place to show off their skills. Alongside the old musicians, a generation of new players began to appear. They began to be called näppärit or ‘string pluckers’. So the Näppärit were never formally established.”<p><p>Kaustinen’s main tent forms the venue when 200 to 300 children, Mauno Järvelä’s students, take the stage as Näppärit (“string pluckers”) each summer.© Breakthroughs<p><p>But before Järvelä’s big idea came to fruition, he toured the Helsinki region with his fiddle. “I was the youngest of eight children, and the only one to graduate from high school. I took the shorter course of mathematics and then got into the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki.”<p><p>Inspired by his alma mater, Järvelä began playing in orchestras, first at the Finnish National Opera Orchestra and then the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 1978, he returned to his roots in Kaustinen. First he was offered work with an orchestra in Kokkola, with teaching making up half of his work.<p><p>Soon Järvelä also started to teach at Perhonjokilaakso Folk College. That became his full-time job in 1985. “For a long time, I had been thinking children could be taught music in a new way,” he says.<p><p>“Musical education would no longer be simply professional training with tests and studies, but would instead be a hobby that offered joy and experiences to as many as possible.”<p><p>Järvelä’s idea was that instrument lessons would use the time-tested methods of classical music, but that the cornerstone of playing together would be folk music.<p><p>“First we play and sing ‘plucking music,’ easy tunes that give the kids the basis for folk songs that are more difficult in terms of style and technique. Näppäri music is arranged in such a way that there is an appropriate role for everyone depending on their skills.”<p><p>Within the past two decades, the Näppäri idea has spread to the other Nordic countries as well as Germany and Switzerland. Näppäri courses have been held as far afield as the USA and even South Africa.<p><p>“The Näppärit get their biggest audience – up to 3,000 people – during the children’s matinee at the annual Kaustinen Folk Music Festival, which forms an ideal showcase for the programme. Every time there are parents with children who come up to ask how they can join the Näppärit.”<p><p>Järvelä remembers when he was 11 or 12 years old and got to join a musical tour around the village with older masters of folk music, arranged by the legendary local café owner Santeri Isokangas (1885–1967).<p><p>“There was an unbelievably wonderful atmosphere,” Järvelä says. “Now – as an old folk player myself – I’m happy to play music with children. They don’t have any unnecessary prejudices, and you can see from their faces how much they enjoy playing.<p><p>“It’s really something when you can just go under a birch tree and play folk music on the world’s most distinguished instrument to your heart’s content – or play in a packed festival arena with 200 of your friends.”<p><p>In addition to the Perhonjokilaakso Folk College, Järvelä teaches at the Kaustinen Music High School. And plays. And can mostly decide what he wants to do.<p><p>“I started playing myself with the Järvelä village tunes and the Järvelä village style. I got my first lesson from Juha Kangas (founder of the Ostrobothnian Chamber Orchestra).” The fiddle group at the Kokkola Workers’ Academy and some national music camps were important steps along the way.<p><p>“At the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, I got to study with the renowned violin professor Onni Suhonen. It hasn’t always been easy, but the strength of the music has carried me forward, and it seems like it still does.”<p><p>Originally published in “Breakthroughs – 90 Success Stories from Finland”, 2007; updated July 2010 and December 2011 <p><p>By Hannu Koskela<p><p>Deep folk traditions<p><p>To Helsinki and back again<p><p>Great idea<p><p>Strength of music<p>", "time": "2013-03-04T12:06:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

This year, they have bellowed poetry, nursery rhymes and political tracts in Stockholm and Copenhagen. Next up is Australia, where they will shout on the steps of the Sydney Opera House in May as part of the city’s biennale.<p><p>You can also try your own hand – or voice – at the exhilarating, witty Huutajat experience if you’re lucky enough to attend one of their workshops. These events have been held as far away as Sweden and Austria. Though the original Huutajat concept is clearly male – described by a Sydney Biennale curator as “a parody of discipline and male power, suffused with a taste for the absurd” – the workshops are open to women as well.<p><p>“The last time, about one third of participants were women,” Sirviö tells me at an Oulu café. “Musically it was very inspiring; girls are faster at learning the parts than guys! But conceptually this has been such a strongly male thing. I did a piece for a local opera where more than half of the performers were women. I could teach them the spirit and the structures and the pieces – but when it came to actual techniques of how to build a voice, I just had to give up.”<p><p>Like many of the original Huutajat choir members, conductor Petri Sirviö came out of the noisy rock scene of the 1980s.Photo: Wif Stenger<p><p>Over the decades, Huutajat have also formed part of two operas in Munich and a production of Peer Gynt in Oberhausen. Their European Broadcasting Union concert in 2009 featured electronics and snippets of the Communist Manifesto. They’ve also done dance theatre, videos and the acclaimed documentary Shouting Men.<p><p>“The film was banned from a festival in North Korea because we included the Japanese national anthem,” Sirviö says. “In Poland some right-wing politician tried to start a criminal investigation because we performed their national anthem, which he said was a provocation. If the North Koreans and Polish right-wingers don’t like us, I guess we’re right in the middle.<p><p>“National anthems are interesting because they often include very strange, mixed emotions – awful lyrics even – but people sing them in very high spirits, and they unite people.”<p><p>One of the project’s basic themes is discipline, he says. “But discipline of groups has changed so much in the past two decades. The younger guys are much more reckless than we were. There’s always very strong hidden discipline in every society and pressure toward a uniform dress code or behaviour, but nowadays it’s more hidden.”<p><p>The Shouters belong to a Finnish tradition of musical eccentricity based on using the traditional to create something radical and playful. Others have chosen the accordion (Kimmo Pohjonen), harmonica (Sväng), cello (Apocalyptica), klezmer (Alamaailman Vasarat) and humppa dance music (Eläkeläiset).<p><p>Off the deep end: Maybe it’s got something to do with the Finnish temperament.Photo: Jaani Föhr<p><p>“Maybe that’s some kind of Nordic minimalism, a way to keep it simple: just cellos or just shouting,” suggests Sirviö. “We love these simple, clear ideas.<p><p>“Back when we started, there were no examples of how to become rich and famous doing music, so you were free to do anything.<p><p>Now it’s more like a brand; there’s a roadmap of how to do it.” Now 48 with teenaged kids, this former punker has an “establishment” day job at the city cultural office: “Of course there’s a danger in being accepted by the establishment,” he says with a wry smile. “It’s difficult to keep a balance. But in a way we were ‘officially’ accepted at quite an early stage, though we’ve always been quite underground. The whole concept is somehow quite dry and clean, so you can put it anywhere without being that disturbing. Our look is quite traditional.” They sport black suits, white shirts and skinny ties made of rubber tyres.<p><p>“About one-third of the guys have been with us since the start – I guess they have life sentences,” says Sirviö. “Some of them are now 50 and are still part of this piece of art. It’ll be interesting to see them start to lose their teeth and turn into a group of angry grandpas! There are now two generations within the choir; someday there will be three.<p><p>“The basic concept has remained the same.

Skábmagovat was founded in 1999 to bolster Sámi filmmaking and add some variety to the darkest portion of the year; the organisers translate the name from Sámi as “reflections of the endless night”.<p><p>In addition to Sámi films, the festival always flies in directors and films from indigenous groups in countries as far away as Australia, Canada and Bolivia. Striking similarities exist in the stories of indigenous people from different parts of the world: They have faced or are facing corresponding identity issues and similar obstacles to preserving language and culture.<p><p>At one previous festival, Ellen-Astri Lundby, a Norwegian of Sámi descent, showed her film Suddenly Sámi, a documentary that follows her travels as she visits relatives to find out more about her identity. When she was growing up in Oslo, Lundby’s mother never mentioned that she was a Sámi. It was revealed much later, eventually causing the daughter to search for her northern roots and ponder why her mother never told her.<p><p>This touching story is by no means unusual, having been played out in numerous versions across the Sámi territories. Until as recently as several decades ago, the Sámi people experienced prevalent stereotyping and discrimination. The resulting pressure caused damage as a significant number of them distanced themselves from their traditions and language. In many places, children were forbidden from speaking Sámi in school.<p><p>Sámi flags: The Skábmagovat Indigenous Peoples’ Film Festival mainly takes place inside Siida, the centre that houses the Sámi Museum.Photo: Peter Marten<p><p>The situation is much different today, although experts say there is still much room for improvement to guarantee Sámi rights within the Nordic countries.

A new exhibition shows how artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela planned a richly illustrated Great Kalevala volume, and how influences from as far away as New Mexico found their way into his depiction of Finnishness.<p><p>You could interpret the tried-but-true proverb “Travel broadens the mind” as meaning that you need to go abroad to gain perspective on your own country. Maybe that’s how Askeli Gallen-Kallela came to find himself creating illustrations for the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, while in New Mexico in the mid-1920s.<p><p>Gallen-Kallela (1865–1931), a prominent artist in the Golden Age of Finnish art, travelled around Europe, East Africa and the US. The sketches he made in New Mexico formed part of his Great Kalevala project. Their bright colours and decorative style show influences from Native American art. “I’ve made four full-blown Kalevala pictures here like newly baked bread,” he wrote at the time.<p><p>How’s that for a new perspective on Finland? One of the country’s most famous artists was absorbing influences on another continent while interpreting the verses that are considered the very core of Finnishness.<p><p><p><p>The Great Kalevala forms the subject of the Gallen-Kallela Museum’s spring exhibition, which marks the 160th anniversary of the Kalevala epic’s publication as we know it today. Author Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) wrote down the verses from ballads and poetry that had previously belonged to a solely oral tradition. The Kalevala holds important significance in the Finnish cultural identity.<p><p>Gallen-Kallela planned a grand version of the Kalevala as his gift to the Finnish people, a gold- and silver-decorated volume with 700 parchment pages including 150 paintings. The leather covers would be adorned with Finnish stones and freshwater pearls.<p><p>“All my life, though at first unaware of it, I have prepared for this task,” he wrote in 1925. “The Kalevala with its world of images [has always] spurred my pen….and this work has continued throughout my life wherever I have been on the globe.”<p><p><p><p>In the end, Gallen-Kallela completed illustrations for five of the 50 Kalevala “runes” before passing away. The Gallen-Kallela Museum complements these with other Kalevala-themed works by the artist.<p><p>The museum is located just northwest of Helsinki in Gallen-Kallela’s waterside studio and home, a miniature castle well worth a visit in itself for anyone interested in his life and work. Some of his most famous paintings of Kalevala motifs can be found downtown, such as the four scenes that decorate the ceiling of the main hall at the National Museum.<p><p>The Ateneum Art Museum is home to Gallen-Kallela’s famous triptych The Aino Myth. This spring and summer Ateneum also presents the most extensive show of Kalevala art in decades. It includes more than 200 works by almost 60 artists, all inspired by the Finnish national epic.

One typical workshop was held in Bahia Blanca, south of Buenos Aires, for a professional dance company called Cuatroycuarto. It aimed to widen the dancers’ professional skills and enlarge their possibilities to work within their community.<p><p>During the workshop, all nine company members composed short solo pieces for themselves, to be performed in workshop demonstrations. Topping it off was an evening of dance entitled Tango for No Body, choreographed by Tuovinen and Heslop. “We think we’ve been successful in incorporating tango and contemporary dance in an interesting way,” notes Tuovinen.<p><p>In their teaching, Tuovinen and Heslop utilise a method called Improtango, which they themselves devised. Improtango takes the best parts of contemporary, improvisational and tango techniques. “We are trying to make tango more accessible to contemporary people,” explains Heslop. “The problem at the moment is that the tango is generally taught as a set of fixed steps, whereas we teach it as ideas for improvisation.”<p><p>As2wrists takes the clichés, cultural baggage and blatant sexism that are inherent in Argentine tango and create something new. This proves both easy and difficult. “In its essence,” says Heslop, “tango is a few beautifully simple ideas that, when combined in improvisation, become a fascinatingly rich and complex dance that takes years to master.”<p><p>Minna Tuovinen and English-born Martin Heslop have been working together since the 1990s, when the couple met as students at the Laban Centre in London.

Many of her dreams have come true. Today she can concentrate on creating ceramic art, as the family company has delegated management duties to the younger generation.<p><p>“I still have the same burning urge to create things as in the early 1970s,” Pentik says. “However, the difference is that over the course of about 40 years, a homemaker’s hobby has evolved into a very healthy business.”<p><p>Pentik made its breakthrough soon after it started as a little workshop in the early 1970s. The national press created a Cinderella story about a crafts designer who moved up north to Posio, Lapland, from southern Finland and created ceramics inspired by the northern wilderness.<p><p>Her knobbly candle holders were considered fascinatingly different. Anu recalls that the department store Stockmann ordered as many of them as she managed to make.<p><p>As a mother of young children, she made ceramics at night in the sauna of the family home. Her husband, Topi Pentikäinen, a physical education teacher, dipped candles in the yard during the summers.<p><p>“We were poor and lived in the middle of nowhere,” she remembers. “We didn’t know anything about making ceramics, but were immensely enthusiastic.”<p><p>The couple had ambition and wild visions to spare. They created their own applied arts company from nothing, producing ceramics, leather accessories and, for a while, even furniture.<p><p>“We’ve needed lots of creative craziness, endurance and people skills,” Anu says. “In addition to managing the company over all these years, I’ve always wanted to keep designing myself and sinking my hands into the clay. We’ve done a lot of hard work, and have spent pretty much our whole lives on it.”<p><p>© Pentik<p><p>The 1970s formed an opportune period for a ceramics company. The only real competitor was the giant Arabia corporation, and imports were negligible compared to today. At first the couple created a limited partnership company called Anu Pentikäinen, but soon shortened the name to the catchier Pentik. The fact that Pentik took off in Posio was a decisive factor. Northern Finland brought a positive image to the company and the location guaranteed peace and quiet to concentrate on work.<p><p>The ceramics factory on “Pentik Hill” was inaugurated in 1974. The era was marked by intense growth. The company’s designers included Peter Winqist, Marja Mykkänen, Irja Leimu and the Korean-born Suku Park. One of Pentik’s secrets of success has been that Anu Pentik has wanted to make crockery for regular Finnish consumers. Cosiness has been more important than being trendy.<p><p>Anu emphasises that the company would not exist at all without her husband.<p><p>“Topi has always been able to think grand thoughts. When I was running around in the world, he took care of the home and the children. He also served as managing director for decades. I’m grateful that our marriage has lasted.”<p><p>She is also happy that the couple’s children have joined the company and manage it with skill.<p><p>The successful company has seen hard times, too. In the early 1990s, Pentik was on the verge of bankruptcy. Everything except ceramics was trimmed away.<p><p>“Even in the difficult times, we saw that our only alternative was to go forward. We didn’t want to let our employees down. During those years, we learnt that a company must be managed through careful accounting.”<p><p>The staff members have been happy at Pentik, with most working there for many years. Anu underlines that the company has made its goals clear to everybody; it has trusted its employees and taken care of them.<p><p>“We’ve always been open with the staff about the company’s profits and debt,” she says.<p><p>For about a decade, the Pentik range has included glass and wooden objects as well as textiles made in Asia. Keeping the ceramics production in Posio has been a matter of honour for the family.<p><p>“In Posio, we produce limited series that show the handiwork.

An assortment of mostly teenage girls waits to be admitted.<p><p>Some are dressed in Victorian-inspired Lolita dresses, making the girls look like old-fashioned dolls, with lots of lace and trim. Other girls shun this popular Japanese street fashion, preferring to dye parts or all of their hair bright colours.<p><p>When we show up, performing artist Miyavi is ready to stir the waiting crowd. Abingdon Boys School is another act that has appeared recently on the same stage. Japanese rock music, or J-rock, is a huge hit among Finnish youngsters.<p><p>“Of course the music interests me, but really what is so appealing is the combination of style and appearance,” explains Hanna Mustapää. The eighteen-year-old has been listening to J-rock for some four years.<p><p>J-rockers that perform in what’s called the Visual Kei subgenre are known for their outrageous outfits – men dress like women or wear otherwise fantastical apparel – and for their stage shows, which can easily combine classical music, hard rock and folk.<p><p>The lyrics are largely in Japanese, but Mustapää doesn’t mind.<p><p>“I look online for translations into English or Finnish,” she says. “Fans that understand Japanese translate the songs on different websites.”<p><p>Hanna Mustapää (left) and Katariina Alainen check out Japanese pop music at Blippo, an all-Japanese clothing, music and accessories shop in Helsinki.Photo: Satu Jussila<p><p>A nonprofit association named JrockSuomi helps promote the music and arranges concerts in Finland.<p><p>“It’s hard to give an exact figure of how many J-rock fans there are,” says Katariina Alainen, JrockSuomi’s vice president. “But a recent academic study indicated that about one-third of Finnish youngsters are currently into some form of Japanese pop culture, be it Manga comics, fashion or music.”<p><p>While the connection between Finland and Japan may seem random at first, a cross-culture chord has been struck.<p><p>“J-rock is hard to categorise, which is what makes it so interesting,” says Alainen. “We’ve all been fed American culture for so long that we want to try something new. The Japanese do things so differently, which is really inspiring.”<p><p>“I remember friends telling me something like: ‘My niece is really into this weird Japanese stuff, what’s this all about?'” recalls Katja Valaskivi, a media researcher at the University of Tampere.<p><p>Around 2002, Valaskivi began noticing that Japanese pop culture – music, cartoons, fashion and games – was making real headway with Finnish youngsters. Thanks to the internet, the fascination spread. Teenagers told their friends, who told their friends, and so on.<p><p>“All kids want to be different, yet they also want to belong,” says Valaskivi. “Japanese pop culture is a perfect way to express both needs.”<p><p>This year the adjunct professor published a comprehensive study on the growth of Japanese pop culture in Finland. “Japanese storylines respond to the lives of today’s youth. Rather than have the usual ‘happy endings’, these tales often show that life is complicated.<p><p>“Because of the variety of pop culture that young people can choose from, they’re able to pick those things they like, and reject those they don’t.

We catch up with her as she prepares for literary events in New York, Toronto and Ottawa.<p><p>Elina Hirvonen’s book When I Forgot was published in North America and made the cover of the New York Times Book Review in May 2009, sending a palpable buzz through the Finnish literary world. A cover story in such a prominent publication tends to make people take notice, at home and abroad.<p><p>Finland’s largest newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, alerted folks back home to the article. The New York Times Book Review piece and the accompanying visibility were considered a triumph for not only Hirvonen, but all of Finnish literature.<p><p>Hirvonen herself was far away at the time, in Zambia.<p><p>Hirvonen’s book deals with memories, love and war.Photo: Olli Karttunen<p><p>Let’s backtrack for a minute. When I Forgot appeared in Finnish in 2005 and was shortlisted for the high-powered Finlandia Prize, a big step for a début novel. The tenderly told story portrays events stretching from the time of the World Trade Center attacks and the war in Iraq back through Vietnam and the Second World War.<p><p>The narrator, Helsinki journalist Anna, wants only to “escape from memory.” Her American boyfriend, literature professor Ian, believes that “only by remembering can we understand something about ourselves.” However, there are things she can’t forget, and he has a terrible memory.<p><p>Anna’s brother Joona suffers from mental illness and lives in a hospital. She sifts through her sometimes painful past, her relationship to Joona, her understanding of her parents and what she knows of their pasts. She also revisits the start of her relationship with Ian and his stories about his own childhood. Several chronologies interweave as Hirvonen presents the reader with details that form pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.<p><p>Love is one element – the expressions it achieves between different combinations of characters. The story also follows the effects of the various wars. Long after they are over, their influences echo through the generations.<p><p>Because When I Forgot mentions September 11 and Iraq and includes an American character whose father returned from Vietnam with post-traumatic stress disorder, Hirvonen felt apprehensive about the North American release. “I thought maybe people would feel like these were their experiences and nobody else’s,” she says.<p><p>Yet the timing seems right: Enough years have passed to give Americans a certain distance from September 11, and the political landscape looks different today. People can begin to remember.<p><p>As Anna goes through her memories, we see how her brother perceives September 11. “When 9/11 happened I was making a documentary film about a guy who suffered from schizophrenia,” says Hirvonen. “That’s one reason it ended up in the book.<p><p>“It really got under his skin. He identified with everyone who was in the war.” In the book, Joona escapes from the mental hospital to go to a demonstration against the war in Iraq.<p><p>Hirvonen succeeds in putting us in Joona’s confused mind. We understand his logic and wonder whether the “normal” world is really normal.<p><p>The title of the English version is not a direct translation, but it manages to convey the same effect.© Avain and Tin House Books<p><p>The book’s English and Finnish titles are very different, but both manage to convey the same effect. When I Forgot started out as Että hän muistaisi saman, literally “That he would remember the same”. Thinking of a happy, early-childhood Christmas before her family started to collapse, Anna pines, “I hoped that Joona would remember the same.”<p><p>“An American friend of mine in Finland came up with When I Forgot,” says Hirvonen. “Even though it’s different, I think it fits the theme of the book.<p><p>“It was important for the title to have something about remembering or forgetting, and I wanted it to be a sentence or part of one. I’m always interested in titles like that; they make me want to read and find out where the sentence comes from.”<p><p>When this article goes live, Hirvonen will be on her way to Ottawa, Toronto and New York to appear at literary events. Before that she’d been in Helsinki for less than two weeks, having just returned from two years in Zambia.<p><p>Instead of flying home, she and her husband drove through Africa, then caught a ferry to Europe and wended their way to Finland – a three-month journey. “If you fly from one place to another, completely different place, it’s confusing,” Hirvonen says. “We wanted to have time to reflect on our life in Zambia and on moving back to Finland.”<p><p>What did she miss about Finland?<p><p>“Friends, of course,” she says. “Streetlights – in Zambia after the sun goes down it’s completely dark and it’s not considered safe to walk around. Fresh fish, rye bread, public transport, walking, forests, cycling, the sea.”<p><p>She also names “being able to disappear in a crowd,” explaining that in Zambia foreigners “get all this attention – mostly friendly, but sometimes a bit too much.”<p><p>Hirvonen is currently writing her next novel, about a platonic friendship between a Finnish man and a Zambian woman: “The relationship is based on the fact that the man has so many more options in life than the Zambian woman does. He’s trying to help her to have more choices, maybe for selfish reasons, but still.”<p><p>The subject matter overlaps with When I Forgot. “The setting’s completely different,” Hirvonen says, “but the themes are similar: losing someone who’s important to you, trying not to feel alone and struggling with that. I still have no idea whether I’ll be able to finish the new book, or when.” <p><p>By Peter Marten, October 2009, updated November 2009<p><p>Only by remembering<p><p>Enough distance<p><p>What’s in a name<p><p>Reflecting on life in Zambia<p><p>Next book connects Finland and Africa<p>", "time": "2013-03-31T00:53:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

His is the most colourful and original personality among the masters of Finnish design.<p><p>Oiva Toikka stands apart from the group who had created the “Golden Age” of Finnish design in the post-war years. Timo Sarpaneva, Tapio Wirkkala and Kaj Franck – the acknowledged arbiters of modernism – sought clarity in forms that were as timeless, organic and “cool” as Scandinavian nature, their main source of inspiration.<p><p>Toikka, on the other hand, took his inspiration from folk art, antiquity and distant cultures. He longed for colour and excitement, finding modernism and his seniors’ “good taste” constraining. He started experimenting with different methods, and was delighted by results that were often “mindlessly fascinating”.<p><p>As a student in the ceramics department of the Helsinki Institute of Industrial Arts, Toikka had already tried to break free from the constraints of functionalism governing ceramic tableware, pots and vases. He was interested in the sculptural possibilities that clay had to offer. His objects were often decorated with stylised and humorous figures of humans and animals, reflecting his keen interest in peasant culture. Other pieces from that period resemble prehistoric relics or Greek and Roman antiquities.<p><p>When Toikka moved to glass, experimentation with colour soon became the dominant feature of his art. He did not want to be known as a designer, but preferred to be called “an artist who also designs”. Yet he designed the Dewdrop and Flora ranges of glass tableware, which became commercial successes. In the 1960s the Nuutajärvi glassworks had in production 18 series and objects designed by Toikka, including tableware, glasses, carafes, vases, candlesticks and bowls.<p><p>When Toikka moved to glass, experimenting with colour soon became the dominant feature of his art.Photo: Iittala<p><p>Toikka was espousing a new vision of glass art in Finland and abroad. As the “cool good taste” of the Scandinavian Modern was losing its appeal, Toikka the artist was able to gain the upper hand over Toikka the designer. Flower power had already left its mark on the Flora range of tableware. American pop art was the next influence on Toikka’s glass sculptures and objects.<p><p>He combined forms that were cheekily irreverent with sickly sweet colours, as in the Lollipop and Pom Pom series. Once the joking was over, further experimentation resulted in large glass sculptures and installations whose harmony of shapes and colours captivates the eye.<p><p>Glass is the ideal material for Toikka’s art. It has inspired him to seek new forms and technical solutions through constant experimentation. Yet his success is based on seamless cooperation between the artist and the master glassblower. With demand for glass sculptures and unique objects growing fast in the 1970s, Toikka could give freer rein to his artistic impulses.<p><p>He had travelled in West Africa and Latin America, widening his horizons and extending his visual vocabulary. He had been born on a farm in Karelia, near Viipuri in eastern Finland (now part of Russia). The area’s rich, vibrant folklore and art had inspired him even as a schoolboy.<p><p>Thirty years later, age-old Mexican glass-making technique and peasant culture provided new sources of inspiration. Toikka’s fantastic forms and rich colours made his work grow ever more distinct from its Scandinavian background.<p><p>In 1971, Toikka signed his first glass bird and sent it flying from Nuutajärvi. On the wings of the hugely popular Birds collection, Toikka has became a living legend. However, unfettered flights of imagination have always dominated his work. His art simply spread its wings and soared into freedom.<p><p>By Erkki Toivanen Updated for thisisFINLAND in September 2009 Originally published in “Breakthroughs – 90 Success Stories from Finland”, 2007<p><p>Breaking free<p><p>Art to captivate the eye<p><p>Well-travelled visual vocabulary<p><p>Flights of fancy: Toikka’s career in brief<p>", "time": "2014-06-27T06:23:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

This collection of more than 660 lyrics and ballads is the companion work to the national epic the Kalevala.<p><p>Kanteletar painting by Akseli Gallen-Kallela: The Fratricide, 1897.Photo: Ateneum Art Museum<p><p>Both works were compiled by Lönnrot from poetry passed on by word of mouth over many centuries and written down by scholars from the late 180 onward, in the belief that national identity had its roots in folklore. Finland has one of the richest stores of folk poetry in the world. The Kalevala is world famous; less so the Kanteletar, though it too has great beauty and power.<p><p>Many of the lyrics reflect peasant wisdom. Here is a mother advising her son on the choice of a wife:<p><p>My offspring, my younger one my child, my baby if you want to wed well, to bring me a daughter-in-law don’t propose on a Sunday on the church path don’t betroth: then even a piglet shines and even a sow wears silk; the very worst concubines hurry along the chuch path all got up in blue stockings all made up in red laces their heads bound in silk their hair tied in braids. Weekdays are the better time: do your wiwing then, my boy! Take one from the throshing-floor from those holding flails choose one from those grinding betroth one who has her coat on crooked or straight without meaning it whose kerchief has hoarfrost on her bottom dusty from the stamper her body white from grinding! (1:88)<p><p>The most famous lyric is based on a folk poem translated into German by Goethe. A girl is missing her beloved:<p><p>Should my treasure come my darling step by I’d know him by his coming recognise him by his step though he were still a mile off or two miles away. As mist I’d go out as smoke I would reach the yard as sparks I woud speed as flame I would fly; I’d bowl along beside him pout before his face. I would touch his hand though a snake were in his palm I would kiss his mouth though doom stared him in the face I’d climb on his neck though death were on his neck bones I’d stretch beside him though his side were all bloody. (2:43)<p><p>The ballads are narrative poems about events outside the Kalevala. The longest is a 25-page sequense of stories about the Virgin Mary from Eastern Orthodox tradition, includind a curious account of the Nativity:<p><p>On Christmas Day God was born the best boy when there was frost: the moon rose, the sun came up the dear sunlight woke and the stars of heaven danced and the Great Bear made merry when the Creator was born the most merciful appeared. (3:6)<p><p>Other ballads include one about the martyrdom of Henry, Finland’s patron saint who – we are told – was born in “Gabbageland”, which is probably England; the grim tale of a 15. lord who married the peasant Elina and ended up murdering her, and a myth-poem about the theft of the moon and sun. The hero who recovers them places them half way up a tree, for only from there will they shine on rich and poor alike. This poem, from the incomplete second edition of 1887, is available in print – original and translation- only in the English selection: The Kanteletar, translated by Keith Bosley (Oxford University Press paperback, 1992).

Wirkkala was an exceptionally versatile artist who was not held back in any design project by challenges of scale, materials or conventions.<p><p>He is best known as a glass designer although his artistry ranged from postage stamps to a fell-sized landscape memorial, and from a tumbler to a futuristic cityscape.<p><p>Wirkkala was an artist in whose work the sources of inspiration evolved into powerful shapes like natural phenomena. The object achieves perfection when the mind and the matter, the idea and its realisation, the form and the function merge.

It was born of a sensitive dialogue between thought, hand, eye and material.<p><p> Photo: Iittala Glass <p><p>Wirkkala’s themes often derived from nature: from leaves, from the swirls of seashells, from the shapes of birds or fish, or more distant observations such as ice formations or the movements of water.

He also sought inspiration from his travels abroad and from early Renaissance art.<p><p>Wirkkala combined art and craft in serial manufacture, when artistic form met anonymous industrial production methods. He bonded Finnish rural simplicity to universal elegance, sensitivity and discernment. He wedded light-hearted experimentation to a sense of high seriousness.

The Moomins experienced a boom in the early 1990s, when a Japanese animated cartoon series caused a surge in popularity for the Finnish troll figure in a large part of the world.<p><p>The family firm of Moomin creator Tove Jansson began to intensify its marketing, for example by selling, in Japan, a lunchbox with chopsticks decorated with Moomin figures. The Japanese love the Moomins – the first Moomin TV series was produced in Japan in 1972, and a million Moomin books have been sold there.<p><p>The current creative director and chairman of the board, Tove’s niece Sophia Jansson, describes the Moomins as having attained classic status, rather than using the term “boom.” “Three generations have already grown up with the Moomins,” she says, “and something happens at that point – the characters become classics.”<p><p>An artist from a family of artists: Tove Jansson painting at home in 1956.Photo: Reino Loppinen/Lehtikuva<p><p>Moomintroll received his first taste of international success in 1954, when London’s Evening News began publishing a Moomin comic strip drawn by Tove Jansson and later her brother Lars. At the height of its success, the syndicated series was read in 40 different countries. Moomin World, built on a small island in southwestern Finland, attracts thousands of children each summer.<p><p>All this began with Tove Jansson’s illustrated Moomin books, originally written in Swedish, one of Finland’s official languages. A total of 13 books appeared between 1945 and 1977; they’ve been translated into 43 languages. The Moomins are at their most original in the books. They encounter catastrophes and adventures and return happily to the idyllic Moomin Valley, whose inhabitants are characterised by sensitivity and tolerance, as well as mischievousness in some cases.<p><p>As the series progresses, they enter a more severe climate, try to adapt to uncertainty and ponder the problems of friendship, solitude and freedom.<p><p>Jansson’s parents were artists whose bohemian life in their Helsinki studio and summers spent on a small island in the Gulf of Finland form the background to the Moomin books. The Moomin figure appeared for the first time in public as Tove Jansson’s emblem in an anti-Hitler cartoon which she published in the late 1930s, but it had been born earlier at the Janssons’ summer cottage – as a drawing on the outhouse wall, in fact.<p><p>Tove Jansson in a summer incarnation, as photographed by her brother Per Olov.Photo: P.O.

One day Per Olov wrote a quotation from a philosopher (in one version of the story it was Kant, in another it was Schopenhauer and in another the philosopher remains unnamed). Tove wanted to contradict him but the quote “was so impossible to argue with that my only chance was to draw the ugliest figure I could.” That’s how Moomintroll was created.<p><p>He was later joined by other characters: Moominmamma, Moominpappa, the philosophical and musical nomad Snufkin, the comically selfish yet timid Sniff, the irresistable Snork maiden, the tiny mischief-maker Little My, and the terrible Groke, who turns the ground around her to ice as she walks.<p><p>There are others, as well, with equally intriguing names (for full explanations we refer you to the Moomin books): Hemulens, Fillyjonks, Hattifatteners, Too-Ticky, Misabel, Whomper, the Joxter, the Muddler, the Muskrat, the Mymble and the mystery-shrouded Dweller under the Sink.<p><p>“I have not wished to philosophise or educate anyone, but have amused principally myself with my stories,” said Tove Jansson, who also gained prominence as a painter and a prose writer.<p><p>By Pekka Tarkka and Peter Marten, updated March 2014<p><p>The characters become classics<p><p>How the Moomins came to life<p><p><p><p>Writer, painter and illustrator Tove Jansson<p>", "time": "2014-03-11T09:43:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

His work was admired by, among many others, Vincent van Gogh. Declining a professorship at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, Edelfelt’s greatest passions were the Parisian lifestyle and summers spent in his native country.<p><p>Albert Edelfelt was born in 1854 into an aristocratic Swedish-speaking family. Despite this background, his childhood was financially strained. The father of the family died when Albert was only fifteen, leaving large debts behind. Nevertheless, Albert’s mother supported his artistic interest and ambitions throughout his formative years as a painter.<p><p>Though Edelfelt received art tutoring while studying languages and history at the Imperial University in Helsinki, he found art teaching in Finland backward. There were few art collections and the country lacked an inspiring artistic culture. He eventually gave up university and enrolled in the Antwerp Academy of Art in 1873. After studying historical painting for six months, he moved to Paris to continue his learning process.<p><p>From the outset, Edelfelt was certain that Paris was the right place for him to develop as a painter. The city’s museums and galleries provided endless possibilities to view paintings. The presence of like-minded artists and an ever-expanding circle of friends enabled him to have rousing discussions on art.<p><p>He was inspired by his contemporaries but was also strongly influenced by past masters such as Velazquez and Goya. Edelfelt travelled back to Finland in 1875 with a strong resolve to return to Paris as soon as possible.<p><p>The initial purpose of Edelfelt’s studies abroad was to become a history painter. Indeed, his first work to gain public recognition in Paris was Queen Bianca, a portrait depicting mediaeval times.<p><p>Queen Bianca (1877).Photo: FNG<p><p>The Luxembourg Gardens, Paris (1887).Photo: FNG<p><p>However, in France Edelfelt soon realised that plein air painting, illustrating contemporary reality rather than historical scenes, was what dominated the capital’s art world.<p><p>However, although Edelfelt lived in Paris for over fifteen years, he only painted one large outdoor work there – The Luxembourg Gardens. The inspiration for his other, comparable works came from Finnish subjects.<p><p>In the late 19th century, Paris epitomised all the attractions contemporary life had to offer. Besides art, Paris was also the capital city of consumption, technology, pleasure, and sensuality. While living there, Edelfelt painted numerous portraits of beautiful Parisian women, a few of whom were also objects of his affection.<p><p>Portrait of Louis Pasteur (1885).Photo: FNG<p><p>Most importantly, the city provided an opportunity to sell his paintings. The rich and powerful of Paris formed a clientele impossible to attain in Finland.<p><p>About half of Edelfelt’s works are portraits. Besides painting often unnamed female models, he also did several commissioned portraits. The most famous of these is the Portrait of Louis Pasteur. Edelfelt was fascinated by the scientific accomplishments of Pasteur and he spent several months studying his work and laboratory settings.<p><p>When the painting was finally finished, its popularity elevated Edelfelt to a celebrated position as one of the most proficient portraitists in Europe. Some years before this van Gogh had expressed his admiration of Edelfelt’s talent to show humane feelings in his works.<p><p>Queen Bianca became Edelfelt’s first work to appear in a public exhibition in Russia. At that time, Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy of Russia and the painting was included in the Russian section at the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris.<p><p>The painter had close and confidential ties to the Russian court for years and was even granted sittings with Tsar Nicholas II in the Winter Palace. He was also commissioned to paint a number of portraits of the children of the Imperial Family.<p><p>Edelfelt was appointed a Full Member of the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1895. A year later, he was approached by Ilya Repin who offered him a professorship at the Academy. Feeling that St. Petersburg lacked the vibrant artistic life offered by Paris, he declined the offer.<p><p>The late 19th century saw growing concern in Finland over Russia’s policy of Russification. This played a significant role in the rise of nationalist and patriotic sentiments among Finns. Even though a goodwill ambassador between the two countries, Edelfelt never totally excluded himself from all this, and he did indeed contribute to the pro-Finland movement with illustrations and paintings on the 1808-9 Russo-Swedish War.<p><p>Part of “Final Study for the Inauguration of the Academy in Turku 1640” (1902).Photo: FNG<p><p>After his initial years of history painting, Edelfelt did not go truly back to this genre until the Inauguration of the Academy of Turku. This large scale work – depicting the founding of the Academy (later the University) in Turku in 1640 – was to be placed to the Great Hall of the University of Helsinki.<p><p>After meticulous preparation, Edelfelt began the actual work of painting in September 1904 and presented the finished work to the University in January 1905. The painting is widely regarded as the apex of his work, reflecting his roles as artist, cultural diplomat, and historian.

{"title": "Runeberg's values live on in Saarijärvi - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/runebergs-values-live-on-in-saarijarvi/", "review": "", "content": "<p>Celebrations to mark the birthday of national poet J.L. Runeberg possess special meaning in the hometown of one of his best-known creations. What wisdom would Runeberg’s Paavo of Saarijärvi offer if he could see Finland today?<p><p>The small town of Saarijärvi, not far from Jyväskylä in central Finland, has a special reason for celebrating Runeberg Day on February 5, the birthday of Finnish national poet Johann Ludvig Runeberg (1804–1877). The village has a literary link with one of his best-known works, entitled Bonden Paavo (Paavo the Peasant) in the original Swedish.<p><p>In Finnish the poem is called Saarijärven Paavo, (Paavo of Saarijärvi). Paavo was a fictional rustic peasant who responded to his life of abject poverty with heroic stoicism, a lyrical impersonation of sisu, the self-perceived Finnish quality of gritty persistence.<p><p>Paavo has acquired an iconic status in his literary hometown, and the celebration of his virtues is not restricted to Runeberg Day. The result of an annual election of the Paavo of Saarijärvi, chosen in closely guarded secrecy by the Saarijärvi Society, is announced on the morning of Midsummer Day.<p><p>The announcement is made in front of the village’s bronze statue of Paavo. A wooden Paavo model is presented to the new recipient, and national composer Jean Sibelius’s hymn “We Praise Thee Our Creator” is performed before the entourage heads to church.<p><p>“The selection of the Paavo demonstrates Saarijärvi’s significance as a source of Finnishness, or what people think of as Finnish character,” says Kari Kotilainen, director of the Saarijärvi Museum and the youngest Paavo ever, 45 when selected in 2002.<p><p>Museum director Kari Kotilainen speculates that Paavo of Saarijärvi would question the values of modern society.Photo: Matti Raivola/Saarijärvi Museum<p><p>“The announcement gets plenty of media attention and there is a big crowd present,” says Kotilainen. The spirit of Runeberg’s original Paavo is the main general criterion for selection, and the recipient must have shown, in his respective field, the tenacity and sense of endurance of the poetic idol.<p><p>As Finland gets sucked into the economic woes affecting the rest of the world, it would be interesting to know what poetic Paavo would make of 21st-century poverty and the ensuing hardships.<p><p>“If the fictional 19th-century Paavo had fallen asleep and woken up today, the almost complete disappearance of the significance of nature in ordinary working life would be a source of wonder to him,” says Kotilainen. Clearly, Paavo would wonder what all the fuss is about as he compared the social safety nets of modern Finland with his own contemporary hand-to-mouth daily struggle for survival.<p><p>In some respects, however, there has been continuity. “Up here in the north, communities have always been able to create a tolerable safety network, and the help of a neighbour would have been asked for in Paavo’s day.”<p><p>“But Paavo would surely wonder how it can be possible that, in such an affluent country as modern Finland, so many people choose to live alone, and why some people still turn to suicide or violent crime,” continues Kotilainen.<p><p>“When daily bread is pretty much guaranteed for all of us, what is wrong? To Paavo, religion gave belief in the future. Now the churches are only full at Christmas or christenings. Paavo would ask, ‘Don’t people believe in anything?'”<p><p>For this contemporary Paavo, the traditional values expressed by Runeberg’s character have not lost their potency. In Saarijärvi the qualities of sisu, of dealing head-on with basic hardships, and of faith in the future are at least nominally maintained.<p><p>“Runeberg’s themes are always topical,” insists Kotilainen. “Love, sorrow, individual fate, love for one’s neighbour, community class differences, the description of nature – to us Runeberg is a cornerstone of national literature in the same way as Homer is to the Greeks.”<p><p>By Tim Bird, January 2009<p><p>Showing Paavo spirit<p><p>Source of wonder<p><p>Love, sorrow and fate<p>", "time": "2009-04-02T00:10:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}
{"title": "Lovable, instructive canines - thisisFINLAND", "url": "https://finland.fi/arts-culture/lovable-instructive-canines/", "review": "", "content": "<p>“Juhani, Tuomas, Aapo, Simeoni, Timo, Lauri and Eero!” says six-year-old Eeva, listing the main characters in Seven Brothers, Finland’s greatest literary classic written by Aleksis Kivi.<p><p>Eeva, like most other Finnish children of school age and younger, also knows the mythical characters of the national epic Kalevala, and the stories and national icons that date back to the birth of the nation in the 19th century, from the poet J. L. Runeberg to Elias Lönnrot.<p><p>Mauri Kunnas.Photo: Otava<p><p>Finnish children’s knowledge of history is not down to the excellent Finnish education system per se. It is the work of the writer and illustrator Mauri Kunnas. You would be hard pushed to find a child’s bedroom in Finland that does not contain a Mauri Kunnas book. For example, 240,000 copies of The Seven Dog Brothers had been printed in Finland by 2007. This is an incredible figure when you take into account the fact that there are just under five million Finnish-speaking people living in Finland and the birth rate is just under 60,000 a year. Kunnas has written around 40 books and 5.5 million copies of them have been printed. His books are also loved outside Finland. They have been translated into 23 languages, from English, Chinese and Russian to Hungarian, Thai and Lithuanian.<p><p>Kunnas started his career as a children’s author in 1979 with The Book of Finnish Elves. It was an immediate success, as was Santa Claus, which was published a year later and has so far been translated into 21 languages for a total of more than a million copies.<p><p>Kunnas writes about Santa Claus, elves and other imaginary characters in his later books but he has also taken it upon himself to tell children about history and old ways of life using illustrated characters. His Doghill books describe life in Finland in the 1800s.<p><p>In Doghill Martha and Runeberg (2005) the kids from Doghill go to meet national poet J.L. Runeberg.© Otava<p><p>Little Martha’s pet pig runs into the study of the sleeping poet and makes a complete mess of the place. When Runeberg wakes up to find a flower on his nose he is struck with inspiration for a new hymn.© Otava<p><p>Dogs who closely resemble humans live on Doghill Farm. The everyday tasks, customs and traditions that fill these canine characters’ year are presented in a way that appeals to present-day children. The kids who live in Doghill also go to town to experience life there: the unusual things on sale in the shops, the fancy sweets on sale at the bakery, handicraft workshops and other wonders of town life. They take a peek inside the Vice Consul’s sumptuous reception room and the cramped rented room of the man who carries planks for a living. Even though these tales about the residents of Doghill are entertaining products of the author’s imagination, the descriptions of life in these historical times are completely authentic and based on careful research.<p><p>Eeva, like many other Finnish children, received her first contact with history through the Doghill books. The illustrations help show her what life was like before cars, mobile phones, computers and jeans. Doghill has also become a timepiece of history. When historical events are discussed, Eeva asks,”Was that during the time of Doghill or before?” or, “When granny was a girl were things the way they are in Doghill?”<p><p>Mauri Kunnas has also taken on more challenging subjects, presenting children with ancient Finnish literature and telling them about significant historical figures. To help him out he has used his familiar canine characters and generous helpings of witty humour. The Kalevala became The Canine Kalevela in 1992. The mythical characters were interpreted in a new light: steadfast, old Väinämöinen became a small but persistent dog, the Pohjola region is ruled by wolves, and carefree Lemminkäinen is related to cats. The adaptation of the Kalevala tales includes ancient folklore but Kunnas has also, in some places, turned some of the stories on their head and made them more suitable for children. In the original version Väinämöinen threatens to take Aino as his wife against her will but Aino drowns herself to avoid such a fate. In The Canine Kalevala Aino wants an unwilling Väinämöinen to be her husband, but he swims away to escape her.<p><p>The Seven Dog Brothers, an adaptation of the masterpiece by Aleksis Kivi (1834-1872), was published in 2002. When the original came out in 1870 The Seven Brothers became the cornerstone of Finnish literature; it was the first full novel to be published in Finnish and was a profound portrayal of the Finnish people. The Seven Brothers has retained its status and is still part of the literature taught at schools. Before children even start school, Kunnas’s delightfully illustrated book provides an excellent route into the world of the brothers.<p><p>Children also learn that in 1809 Finland, in the middle, was ceded by Sweden (Ruotsi) to Russia (Venäjä).© Otava<p><p>Mauri Kunnas has also written an entertaining books about cars (Fun on Wheels), about space (The Out-of-this-World Space Book), about how a newspaper is made (Front-page Story), about things that happens at night (The Night-time Book) and many more. His latest book on history, The Vikings are Coming, describes these wild seafarers and their flaxen-haired maidens.<p><p>In Finland Kunnas and his works are as much of an institution as Disney is all over the world. There is a book club in Finland that sells only Kunnas’s books and all kinds of merchandise based on his characters. Favourites include stuffed animals, playing cards, mobile phone accessories, pyjamas and drinking mugs. Kunnas’s books have been adapted for the stage, animations and a full-length animated feature film, Santa Claus and the Magic Drum. Two children’s operas based on his books have premiered at the renowned Savonlinna Opera Festival: The Canine Kalevala with music by by Jaakko Kuusisto and One Spooky Night with music by Jukka Linkola.<p><p>When Christmas approaches, Eeva starts thinking about what she would like from Santa Claus. She already has one wish, Mauri Kunnas’s latest book. Santa Claus won’t disappoint her — or the tens of thousands of other kids who have wished for the same gift.<p><p> <p><p>By Salla Korpela, July 2007<p><p>Was granny born in the days of Doghill?<p><p>Finland’s answer to Disney<p><p>History, classical literature and folklore: You might not expect the videogame generation to be interested in such things.

Most people with even a superficial knowledge of classical music recognise the melody immediately. The penultimate hymn-like section is particularly familiar and soon after it was published the Finlandia Hymn was performed with various words as far afield as the USA.<p><p>In the autumn of 1899 Sibelius composed the music for a series of tableaux illustrating episodes in Finland´s past. The tableaux were presented as a part of the Press Celebrations held in November that year. The celebrations were a contribution towards the resistance to the efforts to increase Russian influence in the then autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. The music culminated in a stirring, patriotic finale, “Finland awakes”.<p><p>The music made an even deeper impact later in the year, when four of the parts, including “Finland awakes”, were performed again in concert. “Finland awakes” soon came to be in great demand as a separate concert piece and Sibelius revised it in the following year, giving it the title Finlandia, as suggested in a letter from an anonymous admirer. (Sibelius later came into closer contact with this fan, Axel Carpelan, who became an indefatigable supporter and a self-appointed fund-raiser.)<p><p>Finlandia became a symbol of Finnish nationalism. While Finland was still a Grand Duchy under Russia performances within the empire had to take place under the covert title of “Impromptu”.<p><p>In Finland the Finlandia Hymn was not sung until Finnish words for it were written by the opera singer Wäinö Sola in 1937. After the Russian aggression against Finland in 1939 (The Winter War) the Finnish poet V.A. Koskenniemi supplied a new text, the one that has been used ever since. Sibelius arranged the Hymn for mixed choir as late as 1948.<p><p> <p><p><p><p>See and listen here to the Finlandia Hymn performed by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra.<p><p> <p><p>Finland, behold, thy daylight now is dawning, the threat of night has now been driven away.

For one thing, his name is as Finnish as Sean Murphy is Irish, and, famous Finnish Americans are relatively few and far between.<p><p>Eero Saarinen’s greatest works were created in America where they remain and are admired still as emblems of mid-century modernity, in the homeland of modernity that gave the world mass produced automobiles, refrigerators, TV channels, skyscrapers and Elvis.<p><p>Saarinen’s architectural legacy includes Dulles International Airport, in Virginia, a taxi ride west of Washington D.C.; the TWA terminal at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport; the technical headquarters of General Motors near Detroit, known wittily as “the Versailles of Industry”; and the towering arch that is the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial by the Mississippi River, outside St Louis, Missouri.<p><p>The Saarinen family moved to the United States in 1923 when Eero was thirteen. They were not refugees from poverty or persecution in Europe. On the contrary; Eliel Saarinen was by then firmly established as an eminent architect in Finland, designer of the National Museum and the imposing Central Railway Station in Helsinki whose extraterrestrial stone giants still guard its main doors.<p><p>Eero Saarinen studied architecture at Yale, graduated there in 1934, and took U.S. citizenship in 1940. He was to die young, victim of a brain tumour at the age of 51.

A Saarinen expert at Yale, professor Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen, said in a recent interview that the donation is very significant. “Post-war, mid-century architecture interests the current generation of researchers. Saarinen is a genuine proto post-modernist whose work has not yet been studied thoroughly.”<p><p>Now it can be. The Saarinen revival has already generated the four-year exhibition, which is entitled “Eero Saarinen – Shaping the future”.

Sirkka<p><p>The first impression of designer Harri Koskinen is of a quiet, well-intentioned, somewhat shy man whose life has been devoid of any unusual events. This impression is deceptive.<p><p>Lots of unusual and important things are continuously happening in Koskinen’s life. Over the past decade, he has become one of Finland’s most respected, internationally successful young designers.<p><p>He is a cosmopolitan who gets orders for work from around the globe. Yet he is indeed quiet, well-intentioned – and genuinely modest. In fact, he is so modest that he does not even admit to being modest.<p><p>“I guess it’s just being sensible,” he says.<p><p>Being sensible – along with being ambitious – is one of the main characteristics of Koskinen’s work and personality.<p><p>For instance, being sensible plays a role in designing a 300 square metre villa in the upmarket seaside town of Ekenäs (Tammisaari).<p><p>“The person who commissioned it dreams of it being the world’s most handsome villa,” says Koskinen. “I’m designing it as a team with two talented young architects. This project doesn’t have as strict a budget as there usually is on this kind of job. This situation offers us freedom and even a chance to come up with some completely new structural solutions, for instance.”<p><p>Could there be a more ideal job for a designer and architects in this world of stringent budgets?<p><p>“Well, it does cause some problems of its own,” Koskinen points out in a serious tone.<p><p>“In spite of everything, we have to preserve the sensibility and honesty of the design. The costs have to be kept within sensible limits.”<p><p>One of his favourite words is “honesty”.<p><p>“You have to have a certain kind of work ethic,” he says. “My bases of work have to be acceptable and the execution has to be honest. I have to be able to stand by them in public.”<p><p>Koskinen did not originally aim for the position in which he is now. He seems to have become a star through his own weight, without any visible creative angst, special effects, diva behaviour, noise, glitz or fanfares, which makes it seem natural and effortless.<p><p>“It’s funny to talk about it as a career,” he says, seeming embarrassed.<p><p>Koskinen’s starting point was the small village of Vahanka in Karstula,central Finland. His father was a farmer and his mother a practical nurse. Young Harri went south to the Lahti Institute of Design.<p><p>“There I became a cabinetmaker. But I was more interested in design. I planned to set up a design office – and now I have one.”<p><p>He was accepted at the University of Art and Design in Helsinki. Upon graduation at the age of 26 this budding talent was snapped up by the Iittala company, an icon of Finnish design, where he was introduced to the world of glass.<p><p>“Iittala uses designers’ names as an argument to support sales,” explains Koskinen, sounding as if he had got mixed up in something unsavoury.<p><p>“So that started my career as a name designer – sort of by accident.”<p><p>Koskinen says he has been an admirer of Finnish design legend Kaj Franck (1911-1989).<p><p>“I have said so when asked,” he says. “But Franck is not a role model for me. I never even met him. Maybe what we have in common is that Franck, like me, doesn’t like to make an unnecessary fuss about things.”<p><p>Does Koskinen find it annoying that discussions of Finnish design always seem to revolve around the same demi-gods who earned international acclaim in the 1950s and ‘60s, such as Tapio Wirkkala and Timo Sarpaneva?<p><p>“Well, not really,” says Koskinen with a smile. “It just sort makes me smile that there are so few of them to be compared to. If you could see what has been done around the world, these discussions might have a bit more of a realistic basis.”<p><p>As to his plethora of awards, Koskinen says: “At best, of course, they help me to get work, because they show a certain recognition. But I don’t know how much use they really are. They’re more just a hassle. It’s not my idea of fun to be the centre of that kind of attention.”<p><p>By Juha Numminen, October 2008<p><p>Originally published in “Breakthroughs – 90 Success Stories from Finland”, 2007<p>", "time": "2011-09-13T11:11:00+00:00", "type": "culture"}

The secret of Sarpaneva’s great success, which he also enjoys at home in Finland, is that he, better than any other, was able to transform everyday objects into art, to give hope amid the gloom of life, because the companion of beauty is hope. Sarpaneva appeared to life and work at the point where time, space and material meet, and he made that point visible through his objects. He was the poetic interpreter of the material world. As a designer and artist he was unusually versatile, working as happily with ceramics, metal, textile and wood as with glass. Glass is, nevertheless, perhaps the material that was closest to him; ‘because glass is the material of space, it is best suited as a material to be given to light’, as he said himself. And it is in capturing light that Sarpaneva was at his best: he had the ability to show us light as if seen from beneath the ice that covers the sea, or in the living foliage of the forest.<p><p>In a career that spanned more than four decades, Sarpaneva had numerous one-man exhibitions all over the world, most recently a tour of the United States – New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington – in 1994-95, and he also achieved eminence as a prominent exhibition architect. His countless prizes and honours include the following: Honorary Royal Designer for Industry, Royal Society of Arts, London, 1963; Honorary Doctor, Royal College of Art, London, 1967; Professor honoris causa, Academico de Honor Extranjero, Academia de Diseño, University of Mexico City, 1985; Honorary Doctor, University of Art and Design, Helsinki, 1993.<p><p>Suomi series cutlery, 1984.
